Hi Phil,

Thanks for this-- got to Asuncion about noon-- but only now have my e-mails started to come in. Too bad I did not have
this info yesterday since I met for two hours w President Fernandez in the DR about a range of things. Will work to
schedule a call with him                                                                                     Best, Arturo

Arturo: Gather you're on the road but wanted to flag something for you.




                                        Let me know if you can help. Background below.

Best,
Phil

Background: In response to a demarche by the Georgian Embassy in Washington in late April, the U.S. Embassy in Santo
Domingo raised this issue of Dominican Republic recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia with the Acting Foreign
Minister (FM was traveling) on April 28, including reiterating U.S. support for Georgia's territorial integrity and
sovereignty (see readout cable on the high side). The Georgian Embassy demarched us again in early May. A delegation
from the government of the DR, led by the Vice Prime Minister, is currently in Abkhazia on an official visit (May 12-
13). Our Ambassador in Santo Domingo is calling the DR Foreign Minister today to reiterate our concern (WILL UPDATE
AS POSSIBLE). WHA A/S Valenzuela was in the DR this week, but did not raise the recognitions issue.
