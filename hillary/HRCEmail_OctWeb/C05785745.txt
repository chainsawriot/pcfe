Hot off the presses. It is as we suspected - linked to the punitive measures. You'll notice no $ figure mentioned. We will
be pushing for the full $187 million. H and Nides will gave action on that.

NEA is preparing press guidance. I know Jake and Post previewed the language with the Pals so the FY12 language
wouldn't be a surprise. I welcome your thoughts on how and when to talk to the Pals about this press statement by the
Is.

Israel backs aid to Palestinian Authority
ByBEN SMITH I
12/21/11 4:47 PM EST

In a dramatic public shift that appears to lower the intensity of the
simmering diplomatic conflict between Israel and the Palestinian
Authority, the Israeli government is backing a strings-
attached compromise that would restore American aid to the
Palestinian Authority.
House Republicans have called for cutting off the P.A. over its push
for international recognition through the United Nations, over the
objections of many Democrats and the White House, and over the
reported private objections of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

The compromise proposal would restore the aid as long as the
Palestinians ramp down their diplomatic efforts.
And in a statement from Ambassador Michael Oren today, the Israeli
support for continued aid to the Palestinian Authority -- its day-to-day
partner in governing the West Bank -- has become public. Oren said
in a statement provided POLITICO by an aide:
The Israeli government would welcome the decision to lift the
congressional hold on U.S. funding for the Palestinian Authority in the
West Bank. We appreciate that the hold was placed to demonstrate
to the Palestinians the consequences of their attempts to declare
statehood unilaterally at the United Nations, without making lasting
peace with Israel. The Israeli government's position follows a decision
by the Obama administration and Congress to declare specific
consequences, including the closure of the PLO office in Washington
and the withholding of future funding for the Palestinian Authority, and
the fact that the Palestinians have refrained from additional U.N.
initiatives.
We view these measures as essential for returning the Palestinians to
direct talks without preconditions, as endorsed by the Quartet. Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stands by his commitment to
negotiate all core issues leading to a viable and permanent two-state
solution.
