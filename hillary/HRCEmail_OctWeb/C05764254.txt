Subject                            Core goal



Derek and I did not know that the core goal discussion was still a live debate. We made a discovery recently that is
relevant to the discussion. The core goal as stated in the Riedel report is *different* from the core goal that we stated
publicly.

Here is the publicly stated goal, in the White Paper that was released on March 27 (the unclassified version of the Riedel
report):

Therefore, the core goal of the U.S. must be to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda and its safe havens in
Pakistan, and to prevent their return to Pakistan or Afghanistan.

And here is what the President said in his speech on March 27:



As President, my greatest responsibility is to protect the American people. We are not in Afghanistan to control that
country or to dictate its future. We are in Afghanistan to confront a common enemy that threatens the United States, our
friends and our allies, and the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan who have suffered the most at the hands of violent
extremists.

Notice the missing terms in each of these places.
