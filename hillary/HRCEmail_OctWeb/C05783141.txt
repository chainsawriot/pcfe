Subject: Liberia's Sirleaf may offer rivals govt posts (Reuters)



MONROVIA (Reuters) - Liberia's Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf may, if re-elected, offer government posts to rivals in a
spirit of reconciliation after a deadly crackdown on an opposition protest, a spokesman said on Thursday.

   Newly-named Nobel laureate Johnson-Sirleaf is tipped to win a second term in the war-scarred West African
country after rival Winston Tubman dropped out of a Nov. 8 run-off vote, alleging fraud in an October first
round won by the incumbent.

   "President Sirleaf is going to reach out to all Liberians and those of the CDC (opposition party). She will
foster unity and reconciliation," Norris Tweah, Deputy Minister for Administration, Information Ministry, told
Reuters.

   "If it means she will form a national government of inclusion, she will do so. There are good people in the
CDC camp," he said. Johnson-Sirleaf, he said, would not rule out including Tubman himself in her next
government.

   Results from Tuesday's run-off are due to start coming in on on Thursday. Although Tubman dropped out
and urged Liberians to boycott the vote, his name appeared on ballot slips. A low turnout could raise questions
over the credibility of the vote.
