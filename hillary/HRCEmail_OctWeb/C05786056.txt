Subject: Iranian exiles in Iraq agree to move camps (AP)



BAGHDAD - (AP)        The head of an Iranian exile group holed up at a camp in Iraq says the first of the camp's
residents are ready to move to a new location picked by the Iraqi government.
   The announcement Wednesday by Maryam Rajavi averts what could have been a bloody showdown with
Iraqi authorities if the group had refused to move.
   The Iraqi government vowed to close Camp Ashraf, home to about 3,400 Iranian exiles, by the end of this
year. The camp's residents favor the overthrow of the Iranian government.
   The U.N. announced Monday a plan to move them to a new location in Baghdad, but until Wednesday, the
camp's residents had not said whether they would go.
   Rajavi said 400 residents are ready to move first as a sign of goodwill.
