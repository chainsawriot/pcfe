LONDON - (AP)         One of the world's most notorious secret-spillers is going silent.
  WikiLeaks said in a statement Monday that it would stop publishing in order to focus on making money _
explaining that the blockade imposed by financial companies including Visa, MasterCard, Western Union and
PayPal left it with no choice.
  The statement says that in order to ensure survival, WikiLeaks must "aggressively fundraise in order to fight
back against this blockade and its proponents."
  U.S.-based financial companies pulled the plug on WikiLeaks shortly after it began publishing some 250,000
U.S. State Department cables last year. The group says the restrictions starved it of nearly all its revenue.
