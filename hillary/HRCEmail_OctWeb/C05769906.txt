Subject                          Michelle Obama is singing our tune



Just came from USAID town hall where Michelle gave a speech that we cd have written (and we shd get). She specifically
mentioned you and said what a fabulous job you were doing representing the US around the world and making
development "a central part of our foreign policy." She repeated that formulation several times in her speech.

You would also have been proud of Raj - he gave a great speech to the crowd, opening w/ you and your commitment to
development. And Michelle was visibly proud of having him in the Administration in ways that shd make you feel very
good about your pick.
