Jim,

Our main amplifying event today was an on-the-record roundtable for Ambassador Eikenberry with
12 major Afghan media outlets. AMB Eikenberry gave some, remarks highlighting key parts of the
speech for Afghanistan, and took several questions. We will see lots of coverage of this tomorrow.

We have downloaded and are distributing the HP-produced video segments to the Afghan
media. We will also distribute the Dari and Pashto versions of the speech to the media and to all PD
officers in the field for distribution in the regions.

Matt

PAOs and 10s: Please see U/S McHale's request below that posts amplify to the maximum extent possible in traditional
and social media the Secretary's excellent speech yesterday at the Asia Society on Afghanistan and Pakistan. A very brief
email on amplification efforts would be welcome but is optional. Many thanks. Jim

Subject: S AfPak speech

In addition to the full translation of S speech yesterday, we have asked IIP to work with SRAP to excerpt a number of
video clips of key messages which we should push out through all available traditional and social media
platforms. Would appreciate your help in getting as much coverage of this as possible.

Thx.
