     Dear Secretary Clinton,

     I am writing this note as I head for O'Hare en route to Israel-Palestine. For ten days
     I'll be with a small group of women to meet with both Israeli and Palestinian human
     rights and peace activists, with a focus on the work of women. Many things about
     Israel-Palestine make me very discouraged now, but I am always encouraged when I
     mingle with the grassroots lovers of peace and peopleâ€”be they Christians, Muslims,
     or Jews. At those time I feel as if I have been gifted with a glimpse into God's
     Kingdom. So I am looking forward to this week.

     The main point of this note is to offer my sympathy regarding your mother's death.




     Please, Hillary, don't hesitate to ask if there is ever anything I can do for you.

     For peace...
     Lynne
