Capricia Marshall to Be Named Chief of Protocol
44 Editor
Updated: 05/12/2009

By Al Kamen
The long-expected nomination of Capricia Marshall, White House social secretary during the Clinton
administration, to be the new chief of protocol looks to be happening shortly. The job, which carries the rank of
ambassador and is a Senate-confirmed position, is to handle official visits of dignitaries at both the White
House, Blair House and Foggy Bottom. The protocol chief is housed at the State Department.

By custom, the head of protocol also may travel with either the secretary of state or the president, but that is not
going to be the case in this administration. We're hearing the White House may create a new position for
someone who will direct all protocol matters for President Obama and will travel with him as well. The thinking
apparently is that Obama would want someone he knows and who he is comfortable with to be with him on
overseas trips.
