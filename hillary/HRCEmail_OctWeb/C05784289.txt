Subject: Somalia: Suicide bomber wounds 2 AU peacekeepers (AP)


MOGADISHU, Somalia - (AP) An African Union official says that a suicide bomber has blown himself up in
Somalia's capital, wounding two AU peacekeepers.
   Biyereke Floribert, a spokesman for African Union peacekeepers, said Sunday that the bomber ran after a
convoy of AU peacekeepers near the Tribunka square in Mogadishu before detonating the explosives.
   Floribert blamed the attack on al-Shabab, an al-Qaida-linked group that is waging an insurgency against
Somalia's weak government.
   Earlier this month al-Shabab militants blew up a truck bomb in the capital, killing more than 100 people in
their deadliest single explosion.
   African Union peacekeepers from Burundi and Uganda are supporting Somali forces in their battle against
the militants.
