As the attached indicates, Senator Lautenberg is holding up the Generalized Preferences bill that, if it expires, which it
will on December 31 if it is not renewed early next week, 131 countries will see the tariffs on their imports to the US rise
sharply and billions of dollars of their trade will be disrupted. The attached email from my counterpart at USTR describes
the issue with Lautenberg. Ron Kirk would like the Secretary to call Lautenberg ASAP to urge him to drop his hold and
assure him that we are doing all we can to secure the release of Sean Goldman. If the hold continues, we face an
enormous foreign policy and economic disaster with virtually all of the world's developing nations.

USTR is preparing additional talking points to the Secretary. Please let me know if she is willing to do this and if she
needs additional information.
Many thanks,
Bob

Subject: Problem...may need help from State

Hello! So we are having a big problem with senator lautenberg. He is holding up passage of the extension of GSP over
brazil's supreme court decision on thursday to block the return of sean goldman to the united states. Goldman is a 9
year old kid involved in a custody dispute. His father lives in nj.

Brazil plans to issue an injunction to require the supreme court to reconsider. But that's not enough for lautenberg. He
wants to keep the hold on the legislation until he sees what happens and is willing to have GSP expire for 131 countries
over this issue.

Baucus and reid have told lautenberg that getting GSP done is a leadership priority, but he's not budging.

I think it would help tremendously if secretary clinton could call him urgently to ask him to release his hold. They have a
good relationship, and he would probably listen to her. She has raised this issue personally w the brazilians, as has the
president.

Is there any chance that you could get her to call lautenberg tonight or first thing tomorrow?

My cell is               in case you want to discuss.                                                                      B6

Thanks!

D.
