Subject: Yemeni forces kill 7 al-Qaida, fighters in south (AP)



SANAA (AP) - A Yemeni security official says government troops have killed seven al-Qaida-linked militants -
including an Iranian, a Pakistani and two Somali nationals - in the latest fighting in a southern province.
   The official says the military has been shelling two key government buildings in Zinjibar, the provincial
capital of Abyan, after they were overrun by the militants.
  The official says the latest round of violence began late November 15 and continued through November 16.
He says the seven militants died during the fighting. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not
authorized to talk to the media.
  Security has collapsed across Yemen during a nine-month popular uprising seeking to topple the regime of
longtime President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
