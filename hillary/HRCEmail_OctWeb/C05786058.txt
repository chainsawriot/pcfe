                       Republic of Korea FM Kim Sung-hwan
                           Monday, December 19, 2011




Background: The North Korea press reported that KJI died on December 7.
North Korea's state press has referred to KJI's youngest son Kim Jong-un as "great
successor" in what appears to be the first such mention of the heir apparent.
President Obama underscored to ROK President Lee the U.S. commitment to the
ROK's security during his midnight December 19 call, and they agreed on the need
for close coordination.
