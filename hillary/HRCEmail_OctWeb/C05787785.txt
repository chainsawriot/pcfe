Marc — Fatema, from Kerry's staff, called me this afternoon. She had just met with                                              B6

             and Kerry wants to know if there's anything that could be done to get him out, perhaps with the help of a
third country. He suggested contacting           (perhaps through          ), as a non-USG conduit to the Pak mil, to see if
there are any potential options we should be exploring. Kerry wants to be ke t apprised of anything we learn, and if you
didn't see, 3 other Senators today (McCain, Lieberman, Kirk) also called for        afety.

      wrote me (per below) immediately after Fatema put her in touch with me, asking if there's any way she could see           B6
you next week, before you leave for the region, even if only for 5 minutes.                                                     B5

Dear Dan: I would be extremely grateful for a chance to meet Ambassador Grossman. I realize that he is away
at the moment and has a busy travel schedule after his return - but I just need 5 minutes with him. Please help
me. Thanks and best regards, Farah Ispahani

Dan — here is Farah's email, I believe she is at State now or will be there shortly for a meeting. Hope you both have a
chance to meet up.


Farah — in case you haven't met yet, Dan is the Deputy SRAP and works very closely with Amb Grossman, a key contact
for you. Just spoke to him about our conversation and how best to move forward.


Best,
Fatema
