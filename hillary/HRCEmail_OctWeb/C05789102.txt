Subject: Lubanga convicted by ICC

This morning Trial Chamber I of the International Criminal Court (ICC) announced its judgment in the trial of
Congolese militia leader Thomas Lubanga Dyilo. This is a major legal event, as it is the ICC's first judgment of
guilt or innocence since the court was established about 10 years ago.

Lubanga, who is 51, was a warlord in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) charged with three counts .
of war crimes: (1) conscripting children under the age of 15 into an armed group; (2) enlisting children into an
armed group; and (3) using children to participate actively in hostilities. Lubanga was present in the courtroom
in what appeared to be traditional African dress. Lubanga was first transferred to The Hague in 2006, and has
been in detention for some 6 years.

Reading from the bench to packed public galleries, Judge Adrian Fulford said that the Trial Chamber had
reached a unanimous judgment that the Prosecutor had proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Lubanga is
guilty of (1) conscripting and (2) enlisting children under the age of 15 into armed forces or groups and (3)
using them to participate actively in hostilities between September 2002 and April 2003. Judges Odio Benito
and Fulford (UK) evidently have issued dissenting opinions on certain issues.

In reaching its judgment, the Chamber concluded with respect to the first two charges, that the evidence showed
that Lubanga was "essential to a common plan", entered into with several others, to build an army to maintain
political and military control over the Ituri region, and that this plan included the conscription or enlisting of
boys and girls under the age of 15 and using them to participate in hostilities. With respect to the
third point, the Chamber noted that "participation in hostilities" could encompass children engaged not only on
the front lines but those boys and girls engaged in a myriad of supporting roles in the armed forces or group. It
determined that Lubanga's militia group was involved in an "internal armed conflict" against Lendu militias in
the DRC, and that the armed wing of this militia group was responsible for the widespread recruitment of young
people, including boys and girls under the age of 15.

Although he agreed with the Trial Chamber's ultimate conclusion, Judge Fulford admonished the prosecution in
certain respects, specifically noting, for example, that the prosecution should not have delegated its
investigatory responsibilities to local "intermediaries", and that the inadequately supervised activities of these
intermediaries raised doubts about the reliability of certain witnesses, especially since many of them were quite
young. He noted that there was sufficient risk that certain intermediaries had induced certain witnesses'to
provide false testimony. The Chamber also rejected the testimony of three victims who testified in the case as
unreliable.

The Trial Chamber will now issue an Order regarding the procedures for sentencing of Lubanga, which will be
decided separately by the Chamber. Appeals can be filed thirty days from the judgment (although that begins to
run from the date of the French translation of the judgment).

We are studying the judgment to see if any novel points of law were address. In the meantime, attached is a
summary of the judgment, signed by the judges.
