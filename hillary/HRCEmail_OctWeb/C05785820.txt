Subject: Follow-up to our Brussels meeting (confidential)



Dear colleagues,

as you had suggested in our Brussels meeting on 1 December 2011 I travelled to Belgrade yesterday
to meet Pres. Tadic, his Head of Office, Mr. Rakic, Foreign Policy Adviser Ratkovic, negociator
Stefanovic and FM Jeremic.

I explained to all of them that the Chancellor was very sincere in her support on Serbia gaining
candidate status at the March European Council. There would be no moving of goalposts. Having
coordinated with Robert before, I explained in detail what Serbia had to accomplish in the coming
two months on the three critical issues: implementation of dialogue agreements, regional cooperation,
cooperation with EULEX and KFOR. I praised the arrest of Veselinovic as a positive signal.




                                                                                                                1.4(B)
I told all interlocutors that most of the homework was of a technical nature and should not create1.4(D)
domestic problems.                                                                                B1

If you want more details please give me a ring.                                          1.4(B)
                                                                                         1.4(D)
Have a great Christmas and a few relaxing days,                                          B1

yours,
Christoph
