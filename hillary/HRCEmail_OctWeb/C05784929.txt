KARACHI, Pakistan, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Thousands of people gathered outside the U.S. consulate in the city of
Karachi on Sunday to protest against a NATO cross-border air attack that killed 24 Pakistani troops.

   A Reuters reporter at the scene said the angry crowd shouted "Down with America". One young man
climbed on the wall surrounding the heavily fortified compound and attached a Pakistani flag on barbed wire.
