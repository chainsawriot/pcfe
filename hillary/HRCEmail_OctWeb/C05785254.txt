Mike--I am so sorry that this good brave man lost his fight and his life standing up for human rights and have issued a

Cameron munter just called to tell us minister bhatti was shot dead by 2 motorcyclists as he was leaving home. You
remember he was the catholic minister for minority affairs who you met recently. We are putting out statement
immediately in pakistan. Horrible.
