Huma:

Here is a synopsis of a statement just read by Arias at a press conference. Please let the Secretary know that the talks
are still alive. Arias will announce shortly the date for follow-on talks. This is a positive development. Chavez had
declared the talks "dead" earlier today, which was the diplomatic equivalent of putting a defibulator on the talks. All
parties had to go out and say the talks were moving ahead. Thank God for Chavez.

Our Hugo (the Ambassador) meets with the "de factos" tomorrow to deliver our message. I will send you a short note
about the outcome. Zelaya might come to D.C. tomorrow. If so,              I will see him and encourage him to              B5
return to Costa Rica.

Too add onto Peter's email, here is a brief unofficial summary in English of above document from my FSN:

Notes from 10 July 1600 local President Arias speech on the results of the meeting between the two
delegations:

    •   The first decisive step is always the first step, and the Parties have already taken the first step.

    •   During the meeting, there were two versions or interpretations of the events before and after June 28.

    •   The discussions took place in a peaceful environment.

    •   Talks will resume as soon as possible.

                                                    1.17

          UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762751 Date: 10/30/2015




      •   Costa Rica will continue to be a mediator as long as both Parties request it.

      •   The results, agreements and the achievement of peace will be the arguments to respond to those who have a
          pessimistic view.

      •   Arias said that he fights for the principles of peace, understanding and goodwill to achieve agreements.

      •   There will be an announcement of a second meeting soon.

      •   Arias had a petition: "Let Central Americans solve our own problems, as we did 22 years ago."

      •   Arias also addressed Hondurans by saying, "please do not destroy with violence what we are building
          here. There is always a second chance."

      •   Arias told both Parties that they are always welcome.

Arias is giving a press conference right now (on CNN Espanol) in which he indicates
that talks will continue (new dates to be announced in the next few days) and he
responds to Chavez by saying in effect "I won't get into personalized
arguments/discussions, I defend principles" and calling on others to "allow Central
Americans to resolve the problems of Central America." I turned it on late, but did not
see mention of a joint declaration. We'll try to get the full readout/text asap. P-

Arias and Steam called to report that they've just spoken to Insulza. Arias believes that the mediation is on track and is
                            As a result of their conversation, Arias believes that Insulza will be supportive of Arias and the
process. Arias commented that Chavez was critizing him as being responsive to S. Arias countered that he is mediating
because both sides asked him to. Lastly Arias knows that Insulza is seeking the limelight as his re-election campaign gets
started. Arias negated rumors that he is sidelining Insulza, because Arias wants the OAS SG for himself. He assured me
he has no interest in the job. I told them we would provide them a read-out after the meeting.

I'm waiting to get a call back/update from Rodrigo Arias, who sounded a bit more
positive in his comments to the media earlier today. Should I encourage him to call
Insulza and reassure him that things are moving along? P-

Perfect. I just off the phone with Ramdin                                   Ramdin (off the'record) confessed that this   B5
meeting had come as a surprise to him; he said the SYG is clearly "not happy." Ramdin said he and Victor Rico would
stress to the SYG the need to give the process time.

I have serious doubts about what the SYG is going to say.

Hector told Insulza not to do this, but he's doing it anyhow. He is going to be making a report to a closed PC at
4pm today on the talks in Honduras. He, undoubtedly, will be highly negative and report that the talks are not
working.


I would like instructions to be able to counter this by saying we must give the process time; people are clearly
staking out their positions; it is the start of the process and we should not do anything that undermines what
is the best hope for solving the Honduran crisis without bloodshed.


I will call the Costa Ricans and Guatemalans and see what their take is on this meeting.
