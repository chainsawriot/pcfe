Subject: Increasing outreach

I was more than a bit annoyed when I heard that at a recent daily meeting, when, in commenting on the success of
your web-chat with young Egyptians, you asked why we did not do more of these and someone responded that they
were glad to hear they had "permission" to do them. As I know you know, I have been pushing people to do this for
some time and have made it quite clear that no permission is required.

Since prodding doesn't seem to work I now plan to "direct" each regional bureau to work with PA to develop a plan for
weekly web-chats focused on issues of regional relevance and engaging the full range of DC based FSO's and subject
matter experts, including those with language skills suited to each region. We invest an enormous amount in training
our officers and this will help leverage that investment. This isn't brain surgery and can be done quite simply and
efficiently if people put their minds to it.

In an effort to appeal to their enlightened self-interests I also plan to tell them that I will be providing you with a detailed
report on this initiative.

My apologies for not having been able to get this going sooner.
