Subject: RE: Secretary Clinton on Yemen

Jake: Please let the Secretary know that her comments on Yemen were spot on and extremely timely. Having her on
the record yesterday with this statement was a big help in pushing back against the spate of remarks regarding election
delays. I'm seeing the Foreign Minister in a few minutes and will use her comments for effect.


Cheers,
Jerry

Hillary Rodham Clinton
Secretary of State
Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire
January 17, 2012


QUESTION: ...And Madam         Secretary, if I could, could I just ask you about Yemen as well? There are reports the
election may be postponed and that al-Qaida has overrun a city south of Yemen, south of Sana'a. But what is the U.S.
doing to help stabilize the country politically and security-wise?

SECRETARY CLINTON: ....With respect to Yemen, as you are well aware, the instability in Yemen is of great
concern, first and foremost, to the Yemeni people, but to the region and to the world. It remains a great challenge. There
has been agreements with respect to the way forward that have not been fulfilled. We regret that the president has thus far
failed to comply with his own commitments to leave the country and to permit elections to go forward, that could give the
people a chance to be heard and be represented. We remain focused on the threat posed by al-Qaida in Yemen, and we
continue to work with our partners there and elsewhere to ensure that al-Qaida does not gain a foothold in the Arabian
Peninsula through actions that would undermine the stability of Yemen and the region.
