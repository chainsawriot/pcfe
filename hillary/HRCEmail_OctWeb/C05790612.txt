Couple of things to watch:
1. Wendy returned from her AF trip to note: 1) rising CT threats in AF generally, which she will discuss with CT
   and DS; 2) the assault on NGSs worldwide; disgruntled leaders seem now to readily blame NGSs for
   meddling in domestic affairs, stirring up opposition, etc.; we need to think beyond Egypt; 3) P5+1 meeting at
   Pol Dir level later this week to prepare for negotiations with Iran.
2. PA noted that NBC package on abuse in ECA youth exchange programs would air this week.
3. NEA reported that in Bahrain charges against 15 of the 20 doctors had been dropped; in Gaza, rocketing
   continues, Israel says it is trying to de-escalate sit.
