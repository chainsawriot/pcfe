Subject: Hague court convicts Taylor of crimes in Sierra Leone (Reuters)

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - A U.N.-backed Sierra Leone court convicted former Liberian president Charles
Taylor of war crimes on Thursday, the first African head of state to be found guilty by an international
tribunal.

   Taylor, 64, was charged with murder, rape, conscripting child soldiers and sexual slavery during intertwined
wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone, in which more than 50,000 people were killed. The court found him guilty of
only some of the charges.
