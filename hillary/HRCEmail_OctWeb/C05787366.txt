My Dear Friend:

I have been thinking of you so much lately. My heart hurts for what you must be feeling right now. . I wanted
to write you after Mrs. Rodham's passing, but I figured that you were inundated with messages and could use a
break.




Thinking of you now..and always.

With love, your friend,
Yashar
