Subject: Conversation w/Sec Albright

Kurt, Jake: Took a five-minute phone call this morning from Secretary Albright (MKA). She had talked to ASSK yesterday,
a call we facilitated after Albright failed to get a visa to go to Burma this week. MKA's read-out of the call was brief: she
expressed disappointment she couldn't make the trip and asked how ASSK was holding up. ASSK told her she was
"running out of stamina" given the pace of campaigning but is motivated to keep going. ASSK said she looked forward to
Albright's visit to gain some strength and stamina, but perhaps that was why the government decided not to provide the
visa.

Albright told me she took it a bit personally that everyone seems to be traveling to Burma but she was denied. I
responded that this election period is a quite sensitive time for the government, particularly the ruling party, and that
she should try again as soon as her schedule allowed in May or beyond. I told her we would assist in any way possible.
