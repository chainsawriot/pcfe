Hi Cheryl,
I hope this finds you well. I miss you!
I just watched the Secretary of State's interview with Christiane Amanpour aired on Sunday morning and I am overjoyed
at the effectiveness that exuded from the manner in which she so amazingly answered the questions.
I heard her say "Well, Christiane" about four times and from my vantage point it just funneled her right into Channel 2. I
am most inspired and hard pressed to find any interview more effective.

Hope to connect with you soon. I'll be East from December 16th to December 31st and really would love to see you and
anyone else you may wish to gather together with.
Would love to get your update, too, when (if?) you have a spare 30 seconds.
 (Good
thing we talk/type as fast as we do!)

Jeannie
