Very good news indeed. I assume I'll be prepped for S&ED to announce?

Madame Secretary

This afternoon I had a meeting with EAP, the China desk and Chinese officials (MOST, NRDC, MFA) who were in WDC for
the SED planning meetings. It was an uncharacteristically great meeting. They informed us that China will join the Global
Alliance for Clean cookstoves at the SED in Beijing. They invited me to attend some preliminary mtgs just prior to the
SED (incidentally they always thank me for the Expo - who knew that would be such a big deal).

They also enthusiastically suggested that you and State Counselor Dai walk to a cookstove exhibit/demo/event right
after lunch on May 3rd in Beijing. They said that he wanted to respond positively to your lunch discussion in WDC and
your letter to him inviting China to join. They also said that State Counselor Madame Liu Yandong also wants to
participate (bec of your and Melanne's entreaties). We concluded our one hour chat with a tour of the cookstove
exhibit.

They are definitely in but they are still formulating their more defined role in the Alliance - donor vs implementor.

The EAP folks said that they want to use the alliance as a symbol of our ability to work cooperatively.

This of course is due to your consistent efforts and personal overtures with Counselor Dai. Thank you.

Kris
