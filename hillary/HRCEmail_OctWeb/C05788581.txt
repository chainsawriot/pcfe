Subject: Algerian state media: 4 killed by roadside bomb (AP)

ALGIERS (AP) - The Algerian state news agency says a roadside bomb has killed four people and wounded 19
east of the capital.
  The bomb was triggered as a military convoy passed through the district of Boumerdes, 30 miles from
Algiers. The agency says a bus carrying civilian passengers was traveling behind the convoy. There were
conflicting reports as to whether the victims were military, civilian or both.
  The area is known as a stronghold of the North African branch of the al-Qaida movement.
  February 15, in the same district, a bomb targeting a police convoy exploded, but no one was killed.
