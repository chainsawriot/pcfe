Subject: China, Russia may be shifting on Syria - Arab League (Reuters)


CAIRO (Reuters) - The Arab League chief said on Monday there were signs that China and Russia could be
shifting their stance on Syria after the two permanent members of the U.N. Security Council vetoed a Western-
backed Arab peace plan aimed at ending violence there.

   "There are indications coming from China and to some extent from Russia that there may be a change in
position," League Secretary-General Nabil Elaraby told a news conference in Cairo.

  He also said a meeting on Friday in Tunisia of the "Friends of Syria" - a group that includes Arabs and
Western nations - was to "put extra pressure on Syria."
