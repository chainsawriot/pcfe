 Re: Option on W1VID

 Depending on the state of play within the U.N. Security Council, it might be useful to think
 about generating a statement from the UNSC that any officer or government official in the chain
 of command in Libya who is involved in deploying or using WMD would be subject to war
 crimes and crimes against humanity prosecution.

 This option might have the effect of intensifying pressure and creating further splits between
 Qaddafi and his remaining loyal generals. His senior officials should be made to understand that
 they still have a choice of whether they will personally go down with him. There is probably
 some urgency if this option were to be adopted before the opposing forces converge.
