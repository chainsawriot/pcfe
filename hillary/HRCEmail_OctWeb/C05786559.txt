Subject: Qatar hosts Libyan conference after Gadhafi death (AP)


DOHA, Qatar - (AP)       Libya's interim leader is in Qatar for the first international planning conference on his
country since the death of Moammar Gadhafi.
   The official Qatar News Agency says Mustafa Abdul-Jalil arrived in Doha for Wednesday's gathering, which
is expected to include representatives from Gulf states, Western powers and NATO.
   Qatar was a leading Arab backer of the uprising to topple Gadhafi. Qatar contributed warplanes to the
NATO-led air campaign to weaken Gadhafi's forces, and helped arrange a critical oil sale to fund the former
rebels.
   Gadhafi was killed last week after Libyan forces overran the last pockets of government control in the former
dictator's hometown, Sirte. Gadhafi was buried Tuesday in a secret desert location.
