Subject: Greek govt budget predicts lower deficit next year (AP)


ATHENS (AP) - Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos has submitted Greece's 2012 budget, which projects the
budget deficit to contract from 9 percent of gross domestic product this year to 5.4 percent next year.
   The country will remain in recession, according to the budget submitted Friday. But it will also post a
primary surplus _ a budget surplus when not counting interest rate payments on outstanding debt _ of 1.1
percent of GDP next year.
   Gripped by a vicious financial crisis since last year, the government has imposed a series of harsh austerity
measures, including salary and pension cuts and increased taxes. This has led to unemployment shooting up,
with the jobless figure projected at 15.4 percent this year, and rising to 17.1 percent in 2012.
