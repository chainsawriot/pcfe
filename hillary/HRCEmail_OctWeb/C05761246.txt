Note from rose who cannot be at Lavrov pre-brief today (you will get a hard copy):

Note for the Secretary on May 6 Meeting with Sergei Ryabkov and Anatoly Antonov on the Strategic Arms Reduction
Follow-On Treaty (START FO) and the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty (CFE)
U.S. Participants: Rose Gottemoeller, A/S for Verification, Compliance and Implementation; George Look, Senior Director
for Strategic Matters, NSC; Ted Warner, OSD Representative to START FO talks.

Key points:
START Follow-On

L We will meet in Moscow May 19-21 for our first formal talks with full negotiating teams. The U.S. side will provide a
paper in advance with the key elements of the START FO agreement as we see it; the Russian side undertook to do the
same. They also asked that we send them as soon as possible a draft presidential statement for the July summit, since
their interagency will need time to digest it. (We undertook to provide one soon.)

                                                                                                                          4(B)
