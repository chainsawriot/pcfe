Subject: UK lawmakers ask about Briton's murky death (AP)



   LONDON (AP) - British lawmakers have written to Foreign Secretary William Hague asking whether a
businessman who died in suspicious circumstances in China provided intelligence to the U.K. government.
   Lawmakers on the Foreign Affairs Select committee wanted to know if Neil Heywood had provided British
authorities with any information.
   Heywood's body was found Nov. 15 at a mountaintop hotel in the southwestern city of Chongqing. He had
close ties to Bo Xilai, a political high-flier whose career has been derailed by the death. Chinese authorities
have named Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, as a suspect in Heywood's murder amid a new inquiry into his killing.
   The Foreign Office said Friday that Heywood was not a British government employee. It added it will not
comment on intelligence matters.
