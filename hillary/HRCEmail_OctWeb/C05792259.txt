Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird donned a New York Rangers hockey jersey Friday to fulfill the terms of
a bet he made with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton earlier this month over the playoff series between the
Rangers and Baird's home team, the Ottawa Senators.

"The Ottawa Senators lost a heartbreaking Game 7 in their series against the New York Rangers on Thursday
night," the Canadian Foreign Ministry said in a Friday statement.

Baird wore the Rangers Jersey in the foyer of the House of Commons. He also congratulated the Senators on
their success this season in the House of Commons during Friday's question period, the ministry said.

The Canadian Foreign Ministry did not immediately return requests for comment on your humble Cable guy's
contention that in fact, the Philadelphia Flyers, who beat the Pittsburg Penguins in their first round playoff
series in 6 games, are the best team in the NHL.
