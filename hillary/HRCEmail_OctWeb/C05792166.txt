Neera--

Congratulations on this latest honor, and I'd be happy to do the tape. I will also, if possible, stop by the Corcoran on the
15th. I'm copying Lona so she can follow up w you. Onward!

Hi,

I'm almost embarrassed to write this email, given how much you are juggling, but India Abroad (the biggest Indian
newspaper in the US and the Rediff affiliate, which is a giant chain in India) is giving me the Person of the Year award
and have asked if it were possible for you to tape even a 30 second video for it on my behalf. Last year they gave Strobe
Talbott a Friend of India award and President Clinton taped a video, so he kind of raised the bar on me. For
background, India Abroad's Person of the Year award is really the Indian community's most significant event in the
country and most of the leaders of the diaspora are represented there; I know you've been at the awards as a Senator.
The event is on June 29th in New York City. I also know a million people ask you for this kind of thing, so I understand
how difficult it is to do.

And if that weren't enough, I also wanted to let you know CAP's Progressive Party is May 15th at the Corcoran, from 7 to
9:30. It's a reception and while it's a very nice, fun event, it's pretty informal. In my first year as president, I'm really
focused on it being a success - so we'd be thrilled if you even just stopped by and if you wanted to say a few words, I'd
be ecstatic.

Again, I feel a little guilty to send this email, but hope it's ok I'm making such requests. I totally understand the myriad
requests you get.

The last couple of weeks have been thrilling for your fans. CAP literally erupted when your signed autograph on tumblr
posted.
