There is an ideological split among Republicans over who should be presumptive presidential nominee Mitt
Romney's running mate, according to a CNN/ORC International Poll released Wednesday.

Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice tops the list of those presented with a list of possibilities, with
26%. Rick Santorum, Romney's chief rival in the GOP presidential race, was the top pick of 21%. Sen. Marco
Rubio of Florida and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie were tied at 14%.

But among self-described tea party supporters, Rubio is the top choice, with 22%, and Christie is second, with
18%. Rice and Santorum drop into a tie for third place.

Among Republicans who say they aren't tea party supporters, 36% say Rice is their choice, and one in four say
they prefer Santorum. Christie barely cracks double digits, and Rubio is in single digits among non-tea party
supporters.
