Subject: Arroyo's health improving, asks for house arrest (AP)


MANILA (AP) - A lawyer for the former Philippine president arrested on electoral fraud charges in her
hospital suite says her health is improving and she can now be detained in her house.
 Former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo had argued before her arrest last week that she needed to travel
abroad for a bone treatment. The government refused to let her go, even after the Supreme Court ruled in her
favor.
   In a change of tactic, lawyer Jose Flaminiano told a court Friday he was withdrawing his motion for a
hospital arrest in favor of house arrest.
   Arroyo successor President Benigno Aquino III has said the government wouldn't object and wants the
former leader treated with respect.
   Arroyo is charged with ordering the rigging of 2007 congressional polls, which she denies.
