Subject: WFP Update

Here's the latest info we've received regarding the WFP Executive Directorship:

    •    New York reports that about a dozen nominations have been received; deadline was last Friday. While we don't
         have all the names, we do understand that the incumbent was nominated by an NGO.

    •    New York also indicates that Ambassador Cousin will speak to the SYG on Friday via VTC. It is unclear whether
         they are skipping the session with the panel as had been previously discussed, or if they may be joining Friday's
         discussion as well. The Ambassador will also speak with FAO DG Diouf via VTC on Thursday.

    •    Demarche responses continue to trickle in, with most posts reporting delivery without substantive response
         from host governments.
