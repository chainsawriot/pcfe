Hi Cheryl,
I wanted to flag two things:
                                                                                                                         B5
     1. Looks like we will be adding Iraq to our trip.         called Susan to ask if she can go while she is in the
         region. She agreed. Probably two days. Will let you know more when I know more.
     2. Goldstone meeting                        We need a strategy for dealing with the report that is guided by our
         overall picture policy aims rather than the reverse. We think report will come up in multiple UN venues -- SC
         next week, General Assembly at some point and there are now calls for a special session in Geneva. (I am
         guessing/hoping that SER and the Secretary can talk about this when they meet tomorrow.)
Let me know if you have any thoughts/questions on any of this.
All the best,
Brooke
