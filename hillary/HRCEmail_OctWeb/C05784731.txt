WATCH: Syrian President Assad on `GMA'

Walters questioned the controversial Syrian leader about the November 25th UN report, which recorded the human
rights violations including the detention and torture of children in his country, and recommended for Syria to be
referred to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. Walters also pressed President Al-Assad
on his government's violent crackdown on protestors, the impact of economic and travel sanctions against his
country, calls for the President to step down, and whether he will allow Arab League monitors and foreign press free
and unrestricted access to Syria.

Walters also met off-camera, but on-the-record, with Mrs. Asma Al-Assad, the British-born First Lady of Syria.

Walter's interview with President Al-Assad continues ABC News' year of unprecedented exclusives with world
leaders, including former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and former Libyan Dictator Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
