You don't need to do this call. Originally, Cambodians offered FM Namhong instead of PM. The PM reportedly felt it
would be more appropriate for you to address the issue with the FM, as you had spoken with FM in April.

The Cambodians then offered another option. PM Hun Sen would meet with Amb Rodley on Monday about the draft
Law on Associations and NGOs. Post had previously sought meetings with PM Hun Sen, but the Cambodians had
demurred. This would be Rodleys first meeting with PM on this topic.

Everyone agrees that we can just have Amb Rodley address the issue in person with PM Hun Sen.
