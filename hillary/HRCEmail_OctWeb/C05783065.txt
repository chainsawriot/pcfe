Subject: UN's Ban: Palestinians should defer agency bids (AP)



CANNES (AP) - U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says Palestinian efforts to join other United Nations
agencies beyond its cultural arm is "not beneficial for Palestine and not beneficial for anybody."
   Ban said "millions and millions" of people could be affected if U.N. agencies see their funding cut as a result
of the Palestinian bids. He spoke Thursday with The Associated Press on the sidelines of the Group of 20
summit in Cannes.
   The United States and Canada have cut off funding for UNESCO because the Paris-based U.N. cultural
agency approved a Palestinian membership bid _ stripping it of about one-quarter of its total funding.
   The U.N. chief says the Palestinian Authority's foreign minister has indicated that it will apply for
membership in the 16 other U.N. specialized agencies.
