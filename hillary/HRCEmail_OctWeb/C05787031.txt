Subject: Note for the Secretary

Hi Jake,

If you think appropriate, could you pls pass the note below (also attached) to the Secretary? It's pretty exciting
stuff. Either I or your team can email to the folks on the cc line. If you'd prefer for me to send it by a more traditional
route, I'll try that instead.

Hope you are well. Best, Paul

PS — the Secretary's two mid-Oct speeches and Foreign Policy article were incredibly useful out here — congratulations
and thank you.

Dear Madam Secretary,

I'd like to let you know of a huge success for your and the President's focus on entrepreneurship. Seventeen top Silicon
Valley entrepreneurs just spent almost a week in Kuala Lumpur, working first with 800 aspiring Malaysian
entrepreneurs, both social and business, who gained admission to the program, free of charge, from thousands of
applicants solely based on their ideas. The Americans began intensively developing those with the strongest 100
proposals, which will culminate with the 10 most promising Malaysians traveling next June to Silicon Valley to pitch to
angel investors.

Sparks flew on all sides, at the conference and a buzzing reception Catherine and I hosted. The American entrepreneurs
were impressed and even moved by the pent-up creativity and passion of the Malaysians. The Malaysians were
themselves blown away that co-founders of Youtube, Linked-In, Skype, Priceline and more traveled to Malaysia to
mentor them. It became the talk of KL — including with Prime Minister Najib and Malaysia's top business community -
and a great boon to American-Malaysian ties. Some of the Americans had done events.like this in other countries, but
all say they want to do more. They are delighted with their government's enthusiastic support for using
entrepreneurship to strengthen relationships around the world.

"StartupMalaysia" was the brainchild of Dakshinamoorthy Balakrishnan — "Dash" — whose inspiration came from
participating in the Presidential Summit on Entrepreneurship last year. I introduced Dash to you briefly after your
townterview in Kuala Lumpur last November; he is our partner in several embassy programs promoting
entrepreneurship. For this project he went big, egged-on, he told me, by a conversation with Farah Pandith during her
visit in May. He collaborated with a savvy entrepreneur/Stanford U teacher, Rebecca Hwang, to develop the proposal,
corral Silicon Valley, and convince the Malaysian government to fund the first part of it. Now they're enlisting corporate
sponsors to keep it alive.

What Dash started will grow and endure, enormously benefitting Malaysia, America and our relationship. Several of the
Silicon Valley folks tell me they will be back. We'll report all this by cable, but I wanted to let you know directly how
Startup America has caught on here.


Best regards from KL,


Paul
