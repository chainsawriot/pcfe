No problem. The meeting went well.                                                                     Said it is in line
with the Start Comm report they will be submitting to Congress next week.
hour discussing the DoD/DoS issue.



          I talked them through the process we plan to present to DoD next week and which I outlined in the memo you
got yesterday. They liked it and want to be sure it moves forward.
                                      I suggested that I would rather do this on a cooperative basis with DoD and they
agreed to wait and see how it goes next week..



                           I reiterated our concern that any transfer of authority must be accompanied by a simultaneous
transfer of resources and that we have enough time to handle transfer properly.

I will be meeting with Petraeus in Tampa tomorrow and will let you know how it goes.

I was pulled in 50 different directions after we got off the phone and just got back to my email a few minutes ago. Hope
the meeting went well.
