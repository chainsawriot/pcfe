He agrees. Day is lower on list cause of dc visit. We asked lavrov for a bilat already, he's only in town for a few hours on
saturday so just need to coordinate.
We have asked aliyev, new spanish fm garcia and yanukovich (although seems he's not coming).
PhiIs total list in priority is:
1.   Azerbaijani Pres Aliyev
2.    Rasmussen since NAC is coming to dc end of Feb. I haven't offered anything.
3.   Spanish FMGarcia-Margallo: He took office in December and you haven't met.
4. Lavrov
5.    Baltic State FMs: not sure whose coming 6.      Ukrainian President Yanukovich: not sure he's coming. 7.       Turkish
FM Davutoglu: he's coming to dc in feb, nothing offered.
8. Kosovar President Jahjaga: you just saw her so nothing offered
