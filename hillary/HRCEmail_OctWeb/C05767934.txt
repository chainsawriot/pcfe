SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED

ISRAEL

   •




INDIA

   •     Bill said we are making progress on the reprocessing agreement with India.



INDONESIA

    •

HAITI

    •    Pat reported that he had authorized continued recovery of remains at the Hotel Montana because we have no
         way of knowing definitively whether there are more American remains there or not.

    • Rich noted Senator Dodd has dropped out of the Friday Haiti CODEL. It will be Senator Menendez and five
      House members.
MEXICO

    •    Embassy Mexico City's report on violence along the eastern portion of the U.S.-Mexican border contains some
         hyperbole, but does reflect a very significant problem. Post is pressing for danger pay for those stationed along
         the border. Pat is willing to authorize, even though there is no evidence of targeting of official Americans, but
         wants to combine it with authorized departure. This would make it easier for families with children, most of
         whom go to school on the American side of the border, to remain on the American side for the time being.

CONGRESSIONAL ISSUES

    •    U/S McHale testifies before the Senate Intelligence Committee today on strategic communications.

      •    Dan Fried participated as part of an interagency briefing led by Bill Lynn for the Senate Armed Services
           Committee. Almost a quasi-hearing. McCain and Sessions asked a number of tough questions. Dan reported
           later that the Republican members suggested that political appointees had pressured lower-level intelligence
           officials to acquiesce in the transfers despite their misgivings. All Administration officials present denied this.

      •    HFAC will take up the Armenian Genocide Resolution today. Have assurances it will remain in Committee, but
           would like Secretary to call Berman, Hover and Speaker Pelosi to ensure this. In the follow-on meeting, Phil
                                                                                                         Rich Verma said we
           had heard there was agreement to oppose, but not necessarily to make a public statement. Rich noted that the
           Secretary had been clear in her testimony last week where we stood on this and that her calls to House
           leadership would also make clear we do not believe this is helpful and should be left to the Turkish-Armenian
           reconciliation process we have helped initiate.

NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

LEGAL AFFAIRS

      •    Harold noted that it's not clear from today's New York Times' story on Senator Graham's negotiations with the
           WH on detainees whether a deal has been reached or not.

      •    On the Samantar case, Harold said that the Supreme Court arguments had gone fairly well, but that the Solicitor
           General's office had misread the court on this. Harold believes the Justices will find that the Foreign Sovereign
           Immunities Act does not pertain, but will remain concerned about leaving it to the Executive to determine which
           standards apply.

PUBLIC AFFAIRS

      •    PJ noted today's Kristof column on child brides in Yemen ended by questioning why we don't allocate more of
           our assistance to Yemen for civil society instead of the military. Jack may get questions about that when he
           appears before the NYTimes editorial board.

      •    The Times also seems determined to try the Blackwater case from 2007 in the press. They have asked to
           interview all our DS agents who were on the ground at that time. We will decline.

REGIONAL BUREAUS MEETING

EAP

      •    Earthquake in Taiwan has apparently not caused too much damage. No reports of American casualties.

      •    The Public line out of China is that Jim Steinberg's trip has been successful and things are "improving."

NEA

      •    First day of "special needs" voting in Iraq went well, despite bombings in Baghdad.

      •    Human rights situation in Iran continues to deteriorate — the Bar Association is now moving against members
           who supported the green movement, including some who have defended U.S. detainees.

•    Bob Hormats and Maria Otero will co-host an Internet freedom meeting with private sector representatives,
     following up on the Secretary's speech.

•    The model Bilateral Investment Treaty is under pressure from some Democrats on the Hill (Sander Levin and
     Baucus) who want to include stronger environmental and labor provisions. The concern is that most countries
     will refuse to accept such legally binding commitments in these areas.




•    All UN members will be invited to the Haiti Donors conference. Only those pledging new money, however, will
     be allowed to speak.
