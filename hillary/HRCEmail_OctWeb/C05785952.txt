   Subject: Iran warns could stop oil flow if sanctions (Reuters)

   TEHRAN, Dec 27 (Reuters) - Iran's first vice-president warned on Tuesday that if foreign sanctions are
   imposed on its oil exports, the flow of crude will be stopped from the crucial Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf, the
   country's official news agency reported.

      "If they (the West) imposes sanctions on Iran's oil exports, then even one drop of oil cannot flow from the
   Strait of Hormuz," IRNA quoted Mohammad Reza Rahimi as saying.
