Further to December 20 Afternoon Brief:
ANKARA, Turkey - (AP) Turkey's state-run news agency says authorities have released an AFP
photographer, along with 12 other people who were detained as part of an investigation into a group prosecutors
accuse of having links to Kurdish rebels.
  Anadolu Agency said however, that a court early on Saturday ordered 35 other suspects formally arrested
pending trial over their alleged involvement in the Union of Kurdistan Communities _ which authorities say is
an offshoot of the PKK rebel group.
  AFP photographer Mustafa Ozer was among 48 suspects, including a number of other journalists, detained in
police raids in seven cities on Dec. 20, sparking increased concerns over media freedoms in Turkey.
  Hundreds of Kurdish activists have been charged as part of the investigation since 2009.
