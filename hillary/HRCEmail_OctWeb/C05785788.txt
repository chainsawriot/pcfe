Subject: Turkey recalls France envoy after genocide bill (Reuters)



ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey     has recalled its ambassador to France after the French lower house of parliament
approved a bill on Thursday that would make it a criminal offence to deny genocide, a Turkish official said.

  The bill has triggered outrage in regional powerhouse Turkey as it would include the 1915 mass killing of
Armenians in Ottoman Turkey.

   The bill will next be put to the Senate, or upper house, for debate in 2012, with its backers hoping that it will
be adopted before parliament takes a break at the end of February ahead of presidential elections.
