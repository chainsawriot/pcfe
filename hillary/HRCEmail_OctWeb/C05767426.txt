Subject: CHOD

ALL: As you know, yesterday PL announced and later swore-in former congressman Marlon Pascua Cerrato as Minister
of Defense. PL told me late last night that he would name the new CHOD today. He said once the announcement was
made, the new MOD would swear-in the CHOD. PL says that he plans to appoint General Cuellar who is Inspector
General of the Armed Forces. Close in the running was Deputy CHOD General Cervantes. Cervantes's problem is that
his military TIC runs out, and so would have to resign in a year. Cuellar has three more years in his TIC. PL wants to be
very much the insitutionalist in dealing with the military and does not want to have to appoint a new CHOD next year
when Cervantes retires. PL was able to get rid of V who undertook a huge lobbying effort to stay on as CHOD for one
more year or be appointed MOD. PL also resisted appointing General Garcia Padgett who was the institution favorite for
the CHOD position. Garcia Padgett was a key decision maker, along with V, in the coup.
