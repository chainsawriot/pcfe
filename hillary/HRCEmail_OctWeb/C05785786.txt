ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani said on Wednesday that Pakistan wanted to take up three
issues with the United States, which encompassed the rules of future engagements between both countries.


Addressing the meeting of Afghan and Pakistani parliamentary delegations held under the auspicious of
Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency at the Prime Minister's House, Gilani said that
the US must guarantee the sovereignty of Pakistan, ensure that no Abbottabad-like unilateral action took place
in future and that if any credible and actionable information was available, it should be shared with Pakistan.


He said that the drone attacks must be stopped as they were detrimental to the government's efforts to isolate the
terrorists from the local population.


The prime minister said that Pakistan had cut off NATO supplies, had the Shamsi airbase emptied of US troops
and boycotted the Bonn Conference in the aftermath of the NATO attack on Pakistani army posts on November
26.


He said that Pakistan wanted a sovereign, independent, prosperous and stable Afghanistan, which was in the
Pakistan's interests, adding that Pakistan was part of the solution and not part of the problem.


The prime minister said that the assassination of Prof Bhuranuddin Rabbani, former head of the Afghan High
Peace Council, had been a severe setback to the peace and reconciliation efforts as Rabbani had been a great
supporter of friendship between Pakistan and Afghanistan.


The prime minister said that Pakistan and Afghanistan had a bilateral trade of $2 billion annually and that the
target was to enhance it to $45 billion by 2015.


Gilani accepted the suggestion of one of the co-chairmen of the delegation to inaugurate the Engineering
University being built in Balkh with the assistance of Pakistan.

Gilani said that Pakistan believed that political process also needed to be underpinned by economic
development and was therefore carrying out reconstruction work in Afghanistan out of the $330 million money
pledged.


The prime minister asked the Afghan parliamentarians to express his best wishes to Afghan President Hamid
Karzai.


Earlier, Co-chairman of the Afghan Parliamentary delegation and member of Wolesi Jirga Abdul Latif Pedram
thanked the prime minister for inviting the delegation to the Prime Minister's House. He said that Pakistan was
very important for Afghanistan and thanked the government of Pakistan for financial and technical assistance in
the fields of infrastructure, education and health.
