Subject: "Friends of Syria" to recognize SNC soon (Reuters)



TUNIS (Reuters) - Western and Arab powers will probably recognise the Syrian National Council as the
legitimate representative of the Syrian people during the next meeting of the "Friends of Syria" group in
Turkey, the Tunisian foreign minister said.

   Rafik Abdessalem, who chaired the inaugural "Friends of Syria" meeting in the Tunisian capital, said of the
recognition issue: "We have gone half the way and we will probably do the other half in Turkey."

   He also said the meeting had backed an Arab League demand for a joint Arab and United Nations force to
help end the violence in Syria. However, this point was not included in the meeting's final communique.
