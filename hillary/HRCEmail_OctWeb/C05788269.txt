- we asked for extra crew so u can stay for all of us-eu summit
- since jerusalem is off, you can linger in vilnius or go to brussels early. Depends on where you want to spend night.
Might be better in vinius.
- on todays call with burma team, host govt isn't on same page with eap in terms of the kinds of meetings and venues so
negotiations going on now. Will keep you updated. Also, the assk dinner is a mess. None of these places seem right. I
think you and she will feel weird at these fancy frenchy places with little privacy. Raised with kurt who was suggesting
this and he's now offering our amb residence which I think is best esp since you are hosting. Its on the lake, has a
beautiful pagoda where posner and others do meetings.
- they are compiling libyan cabinet members as you requested. Its all secure so told them to give you on return to dc
unless u want them secure faxed over thanksgiving.
