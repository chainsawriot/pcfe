Jake, My understanding is that Bill and John B agreed upon conditions for travel: stop somewhere else first, no
political activity in US, and must depart US by Feb 21 (before the official visa type becomes invalid). Also, we
advised that          should not return to      until after the                   But       advisor said he
would not relay this condition.




At this point we've received a list of 43 travelers, including youngest son, mother, and apparently a wife. Who
the others are we don't know. We have not yet received actual visa applications.

I'll relay anything more I find. Rob
