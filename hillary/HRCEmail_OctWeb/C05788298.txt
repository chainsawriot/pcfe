Subject: Emir of Qatar calls for Arab troops in Syria (AP)


   BEIRUT - (AP) The Emir of Qatar says that Arab troops should be sent to Syria to stop a deadly
crackdown that has claimed the lives of thousands of people in the past ten months.
   Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani's comments to CBS "60 Minutes", which will be aired Sunday, are the
first statements by an Arab leader calling for the deployment of troops inside Syria.
   They come amid growing claims that a team of Arab observers dispatched to Syria has failed to stop the
killings.
   Qatar, which once had close relations with Damascus, has been a harsh critic of the crackdown by President
Bashar Assad's regime.
