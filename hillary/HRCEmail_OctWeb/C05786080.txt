Sounds good. I suspect you will have regular PCs on Tuesday at 5:15pm and 4:30pm on Wednesday but there were no
topics set as of yesterday for either one. Other than those two potential PCs, you have the usual senior staff and NS
meetings but that is all, we kept them completely flexible and open for full days of office time.

I'd like to take either a flight from White Plains or the shuttle around 9-10am Tuesday to DC and back to WP around 6pm
Wednesday.




Please tell the USSS I have personal meetings in the City starting at 10am Thursday morning



Cheryl has an appt request I'd like to do either day.

Do you have any more info about the schedule in the office those two days?
