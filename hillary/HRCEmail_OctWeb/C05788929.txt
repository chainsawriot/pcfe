Haitians' Confidence in Government Rebounds
Recent optimism about government, leadership, and corruption may
advance Haitian recovery
by Linda Lyons

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The percentage of Haitians who have confidence in their national government has
nearly tripled since an earthquake all but destroyed their country two years ago. Nearly half (46%) expressed
confidence in October 2011 -- an increase of 30 percentage points since the last poll conducted in July 2010.

                         Do you have confidence in the national government?
                         Asked of Haitian adults
                            Yes

 More Haitians are confident now than before the disaster, likely reflecting their hopes for the recent change in
 presidential leadership. Musician-turned-politician Michel Martelly swept to victory in a March 2011 runoff
 election, defeating former President Rene Preval, whom Haitians had little faith in even before the earthquake.

The World Bank's World Governance Indicators have consistently ranked Haiti in the bottom 10% of all
countries in government effectiveness, but Haitians' perceptions of government institutions are clearly changing
for the better -- with some justifiable cause. Although the pace of development is relatively slow, the
government is apparently being credited with moving new projects forward. The government has announced
major projects in the provinces, such as an industrial park in northern Haiti that will employ about 25,000. The
international airport in Cap-Haitien in the north is scheduled to open next year, and work is under way at the
Cayes airport in the south, according to Raymond A. Joseph, former Haitian ambassador to the U.S.

Not only are Haitians' opinions about their national government and leadership improving, they also regard
local conditions more favorably. Approval of city leadership improved to 28% from 12% in 2010, and overall
city satisfaction is up to 58% from 45% in 2010.

Haitians are also less likely to perceive corruption in leadership than they have ever been since Gallup started
polling annually in the country. Currently, more than half of Haitians (57%) say corruption is widespread in the
government, down from 70% between 2006 and 2010. Despite Haitians' recent optimism in this regard, the
World Bank's World Governance Indicators continue to rank Haiti in the bottom 10% of all countries for
control of corruption.

                        Is corruption widespread throughout the government?
                        Asked of Haitian adults

                       111 Yes

Implications

Martelly will need to capitalize on Haitians' upswing in optimism toward government institutions by asking for

their support as he seeks a legislature that will reinforce his economic proposals in the Senate elections later this
year. In addition to natural disasters, Haiti has also been dogged by riots, coup d'etats, and political instability
throughout much of its history. A confident, optimistic public can enhance the prospects for sustaining
momentum toward better governance and social harmony. Inarguably, Haitians continue to struggle for post-
earthquake stability, but the latest Gallup findings show they are more likely than ever before to believe that it
will happen.

Survey Methods

Results are based on face-to-face interviews with 504 adults, aged 15 and older, conducted Oct. 23-28, 2011, in
Haiti. For results based on the total sample of national adults, one can say with 95% confidence that the
maximum margin of sampling error is Â±4.8 percentage points. The margin of error reflects the influence of data
weighting. In addition to sampling error, question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can
introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls.

For more complete methodology and specific survey dates, please review Gallup's Country Data Set details.
