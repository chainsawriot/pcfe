Subject: Gunmen kill 5 in attack on mosque in Nigeria's Kano (Reuters)


KANO (Reuters) - Gunmen sprayed a mosque with bullets in Nigeria's biggest northern city of Kano on Friday,
killing five worshippers, a police spokesman said.

  Majiya Musa said the attackers were suspected to be from radical Islamist sect Boko Haram, which is
waging an increasingly violent insurgency in the north of Africa's most populous country.

  "They came on the back of a motorcycle and shot sporadically at worshippers this evening ... the situation is
now under control. An investigation has been launched," he said.
