Sarcastic Syrian Rebels Dupe Neocon Delusionists

Sign: "Obama's Procrastination Kills Us: We Miss Bush's Audacity. The World Is Better With America's Republicans.
Occupied Kafranbel 16 12 2011"

When Rachel Abrams, an unabashed genocide enthusiast [1] who is also the wife of former Assistant
Secretary of State Elliot Abrams, discovered the photo displayed to the left, she apparently believed
she had obtained incontrovertible evidence that the Syrian revolution was yearning for the good old
days when George W. Bush bombed the Middle East all the way to its liberation. "5,000 Syrians have
been massacred by Bashar Assad since March, including 300 children. How are those sanctions
workin' out, Mr. Obama?" Abrams wrote [2] beneath the photo. She told a commenter that she
received the photo "from a friend who has close contacts in Syria."
Overjoyed by the images of apparent pro-Bush nostalgia emanating from the Syrian resistance, the
neocon Weekly Standard excitedly linked to Abrams' post and displayed the photo in a post entitled,
"Missing Bush." [3]
I happen to have a friend with a real name -- Eman Morsi -- who has no connection to Syria, but who
does possess a fluent command of the Arabic language. Morsi translated for me a number of signs
from Kafranbel, the town in northern Syria which produced the banner in question, and several
articles about the town. What Abrams and her well-connected friend were unable to ascertain, but
what any person with advanced knowledge of Arabic could easily learn through a basic Google search,
is that Kafranbel has become renowned throughout the region for its sarcastic protest signs and dark
sense of humor. And the town's residents are no fans of Bush.
One article about Kafranbel on a Syrian-Kurdish website is entitled, [4] "Kafranabel: the Syrian city
most famous for its sarcastic signs." The article states, "Kafranabel...has become famous for its signs
that have been circulating among Syrians on the pages of the social network Facebook, through which
they express with a sarcastic style the misery that the Syrians suffer and the daily killings that they
face."
Another article about Kafranabel by Rami Al-Amin described [5] how "this little town...was able to
send to the entire world messages that combine humor with severity, a kind of black comedy that the
sons of this region use to tell us, 'The worst affliction is what makes you laugh.'"

Al-Amin highlighted one widely publicized banner that read, "We Ask That More [Syrian] Tanks Be
Sent To Kafranabel... To Relieve Death Stricken Horns." To an intellectual heavyweight like Rachel
Abrams and the Middle East experts at the Weekly Standard, this must mean that the freedom-loving
people of Kafranabel love Syrian tanks.
Kafranabel residents make no secret of their opinion of George W. Bush. In the Kafranabel public
online forum, several discussions of Bush dating back to 2008 refer to him [6] with flattering titles
like, "The Criminal Bush," "The Tyrant President Bush," "The Dog of the Imperialist United States,"
and "The Idiot Bush." Meanwhile, the US military is referred to as "The Imperial Forces," while any
reference to the liberation of Iraq is placed between sarcastic quotation marks. A lengthy joke [7]
about the stupidity of Bush and his inner circle is featured in another thread at the Kafranabel forum.
Given the humorous style of Kafranabel's protest banners and the town's loathing of the Bush
administration, a sentiment shared throughout the Arab world, it is clear that the sign Abrams and
the Weekly Standard were hyping meant something completely different from what they believed it
did. By sarcastically contrasting the "procrastinating" Obama with the hyper-bellicose Republicans,
the town's residents were simply expressing their frustration at the silence of the international
community and NATO's inaction.

In fact, another Kafranbel banner [8] reflects a common view in the region: Bush and Obama share
equally cynical foreign policy priorities. "If We Don't Have Oil Like Iraq Or Libya, Don't We Deserve
To Live?!!" the sign reads.
But the people of Kafranbel are not only waiting on intervention from Western nations. They are also
calling on animal lovers to save them. "Animal rights organizations," a Kafranabel banner declared,
[9] "Try To Protect Us!... No Body Cares For Our Humanity?" "
