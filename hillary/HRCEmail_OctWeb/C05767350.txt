(SBU) Democratic Unionists announced their lawmakers' unanimous backing for the still-confidential deal on how
Northern Ireland will take control of its justice system from Britain, according to press. British Prime Minister Brown said
the agreement was possible because of "a new spirit of mutual cooperation and respect." Northern Ireland Prime Minister
Cowen called the deal "an essential step for peace, stability and security in Northern Ireland."
