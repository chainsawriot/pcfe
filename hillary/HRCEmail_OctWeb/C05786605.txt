Subject                            HELP-- we are now waiting for at least an hour to take off--and maybe longer



I am so unhappy since again no one said a word but as soon as we pulled away from gate we were told we'd wait for 20
minutes and now just told it will be at least an hour but the good news is that they can't keep us out here longer than 3
hours! So, I want to go to plan B--pls do all you can to get us flying and if that doesn't work, I want to drive so have asked
Service and DS to try to work that out.
