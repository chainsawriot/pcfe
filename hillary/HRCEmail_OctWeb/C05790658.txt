And you'll see in today's NYT and WP that Todd's backgrounder absolutely paid off.

When he left for law school, Emily Cain replaced Ben Kobren as Todd's press person, and she's done a great job putting
this week together. Good seeing how far she's come since being our press aide in the Senate office.

State's been a great period of growth for all of the younger staff you brought to the Department from the Senate and
the campaign. For almost all of them, four years at one place is the longest job they've ever had. It's been a good
learning environment for them. They're all far more equipped and ready for whatever comes their way next than they
realize.

can't get on air, and their bigger names are really only interested in talking to you about everything but. So instead of
NPR, going to keep trying to find someone actually interested in the issue.
