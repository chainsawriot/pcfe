Subject: More schedule items

Mitch McConnell asked me again when I was coming to his program at Ky. I asked him if a Sunday would work and he
said they had never done the program that day but thought it would work. I'd like to do when Bill would be out of town.
Let's discuss.

There's a lawyer in Little Rock named John Gill who's doing a book about the Arkansas Governor's Mansion. He's
interviewed everyone but me. Pls schedule a call w him asap.

I want to visit the non P bureaus--especially S/P (Anne-Marie says there is a tradition of a photo w the Secretary), T, CA.
We need a schedule to try to do all of these in January.




I also have to meet w the Armenia Caucus after Congress is back.

I want to meet w Walter Isaacson this month.
