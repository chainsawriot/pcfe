Hillary, Jonathan Powell has launched a new NGO that has already initiated some very interesting work below the radar.
(See his message below.) He has contacted me about meeting the right people at State. He knows Bill Burns and will
meet him. Are there others he should meet? Thanks. Sid



We are trying to replicate what we did in Northern Ireland by setting up secret channels between insurgents and
governments and then, where appropriate, developing these into negotiations. We have been very successful at getting
this off the ground quickly and we have live projects in Nigeria, Colombia, Bahrain, Afghanistan and — bizarrely — North
Korea. We are starting work in Syria, in conjunction with Kofi Annan, in Yemen, in Somalia and in Burma. We work closely
with FCO, NSC and SIS in London but this is our first visit to the US to talk about what we do. I have a meeting with Bill
Burns, an old friend, but would be grateful for guidance on who else I should see in DC and in New York.
I will be in Washington from 18 to 21 March and then in New York from 21-23 March. I will be accompanied by my deputy,
Arabella Phillimore, ex UN and ex FCO (Afghanistan).
