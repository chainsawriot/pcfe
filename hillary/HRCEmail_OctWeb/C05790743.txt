Report: Egypt's Islamist presidential hopeful attacked in carjacking, suffers concussion



By Associated Press, Published: February 23 I Updated: Friday, February 24, 1:28 AM



CAIRO â€” A prominent Egyptian Islamist and presidential hopeful is in hospital after a carjacking attack

overnight on a highway to Cairo.



The state MENA news agency says three masked gunmen attacked Abdel-Moneim Aboul-Fotouh as he was

returning from a campaign trip to Menoufia, north of the Egyptian capital.



MENA says Aboul-Fotouh sustained a concussion while his driver was wounded. Both were in hospital on

Friday. The assailants made away with the car.



A liberal within the Muslim Brotherhood, Aboul-Fotouh gained support among pro-democracy groups behind

the country's uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak last year. The Brotherhood expelled him when he declared

 his intention to run in the upcoming presidential elections.



 Crime has been on the rise in Egypt since Mubarak's ouster.
