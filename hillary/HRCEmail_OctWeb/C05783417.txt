Subject: Iran prosecutor to gather evidence of US 'crimes' (AP)

TEHRAN, Iran - (AP) Iran's judiciary chief says that he has assigned the country's state prosecutor to gather
evidence proving U.S. crimes in Iran and elsewhere.
   The statement by Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani, a cleric who heads the country's judicial system, come days after
the U.S. accused Iranian government agents of plotting to kill the Saudi ambassador in the United States. Iran
has dismissed the charges as absurd.
   In comments broadcast Wednesday on state television, Larijani says his country is planning to sue the United
States for committing "crimes" against both Iranians and Americans. He cited the arrest of Occupy Wall Street
protesters as a U.S. "human rights violation."
   He did not say whether Tehran planned to file the suit before an Iranian or an international court.
