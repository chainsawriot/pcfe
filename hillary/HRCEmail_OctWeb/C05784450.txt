Subject: Blair statement



       Tony Blair just issued the following statement.

       "I continue to call on the Israeli government to release the clearance revenues it is withholding
       from the Palestinian Authority without delay and resume their transfer on a regular basis.

       "Israel should release the Palestinians' funds, consistent with previous Israeli-Palestinian
       agreements.

           "The funds are vital for the functioning of the PA and Israel's withholding of these Palestinian
           funds threatens the salaries of some 180,000 employees, including Palestinian security officials
           who are working to provide security in the West Bank.

           "Only those who oppose, peace and Israeli-Palestinian cooperation benefit from the withholding
           of PA funds."
