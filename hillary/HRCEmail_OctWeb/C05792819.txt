Really nice story about a very sweet guy whom we need to stay in touch w. I also heard a lot at the townterview in
Kolkata from young Indians about how excited they were to be part of the new youth councils we've set up at the
Embassy and our consulates.

I just heard a story that made me love him and wanted you to know: the woman who cleans our suite was raving about
how he sat down with her and looked at her pay stub and told her all the things she could deduct. She says he saved her
so much money that she can buy her kids new clothes and toys which she has never been able to do. Who has ever
heard of such uncommon kindness around here?
