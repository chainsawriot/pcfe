Subject: Tymoshenko's husband seeks asylum in Czech Republic -source (Reuters)



PRAGUE (Reuters) - The husband of Ukraine's jailed opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko has asked for
asylum in the Czech Republic, a Czech government source said on Friday.

   Former Prime Minister Tymoshenko was sentenced in October in to seven years in prison for abuse of office
in what the United States and the European Union denounced as a politically-motivated trial.

   Her husband, Oleksander Tymoshenko, requested asylum in the Czech Republic at the end of last year, the
source told Reuters.

    "He applied at the end of the last year and there has been no decision yet," the source said.

    A spokesman for the Interior Ministry, which handles asylum cases, declined to comment.

   The Czech Republic has a policy of supporting opposition in countries that have patchy human rights
records, a legacy of former President Vaclav Havel.

 . Last year, the Czech Republic granted asylum to Bohdan Danylyshyn, a former economy minister in
Tymoshenko's cabinet wanted in Ukraine for suspected abuse of office.

    Ukraine expelled two Czech diplomats and the Czechs retaliated later in the year, straining relations.

    Oleksander Tymoshenko is part owner of a business registered in the Czech Republic.
