Subject: Syrians refuse to meet monitors in hotspot area-activists (Reuters)



BEIRUT, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Syrians in a flashpoint area of the city of Horns refused to meet Arab League
monitors in the presence of a Syrian army officer, prompting the observers to withdraw from the area, activists
said on Wednesday.

 "The monitors left the Baba Amr neighbourhood because they refused to enter the neighbourhood without
being escorted by Lieutenant Colonel Mudeen Neda from the Fourth Division," said Ahmed, a local activist and
resident of Baba Amr.

"The families of the martyrs and the wounded refused to meet them in his presence, and the monitors left."
