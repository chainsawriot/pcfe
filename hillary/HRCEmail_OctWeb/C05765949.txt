Rich and I and his team did prep sessions with Karl yesterday and today. They were very productive and I will let Rich
chime in here, but set the stage for effective testimony this week. We made sure that Karl and General McCrystal were
familiar with the effective formulations that you and Secretary Gates worked out through the week and in the Sunday
shows you taped yesterday.
