Subject: Record number of women in Slovenia parliament (AP)

LJUBLJANA, Slovenia - (AP) Women are set to walk away with a record number of seats in Slovenia's
parliamentary election.
   Preliminary results Monday indicate that women won 28 seats, the most since the country gained
independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991. Women previously held just 14 seats in the 90-member
assembly, which was dissolved in October.
   The official STA news agency described the change as a "profound shift in Slovenian politics."
   The Sunday election's other big surprise was the party that won. Preliminary results show Positive Slovenia, a
center-left party, defeated the favored conservatives.
