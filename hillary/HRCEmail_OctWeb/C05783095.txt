Subject: Greek premier to start talks on caretaker govt (AP)



ATHENS (AP) - Greece's embattled prime minister promised to start immediate powersharing talks to form a
caretaker government, declaring his willingness to step aside if needed, but ruled out snap elections that he said
would scuttle a major new European debt deal.
   George Papandreou made the pledge late Friday, moments before lawmakers were to cast ballots in a
confidence vote in his troubled two-year Socialist government. The vote comes days after Papandreou's
ultimately scrapped plan to put the debt deal to a referendum sparked an open rebellion in the governing party,
with deputies openly calling for him to step down.
   The plan to put the deal to a popular vote had led to anger among European leaders and roiled global markets.
Papandreou withdrew the plan Thursday.
