Tribe argued Bowers v. Hardwick and lost, though his oral argument was tremendous. So he is genuinely moved by this

Bravo to you and HC on yesterday's global LGBT announcement. The closest analogue is probably Eleanor Roosevelt's
1948 launch of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This latest step opens a much-needed further chapter. I
don't know if HC would care what I think, but if you get a chance please congratulate her for me. This will be
remembered as one of her greatest initiatives. Yours too, I suspect.

All best,

Larry
