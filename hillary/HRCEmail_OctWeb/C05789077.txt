Subject: CTV Update: 3/25

Today's highlights:

- CEP spokesperson held a press conference today at the CTV: no information unknown to us was presented, but it was a
positive step towards having more transparency for the public

- one possible concern given the current backlog is that results would not be ready by march 31, unless one of 2 things
happen:
1. the threshold is raised to reduce the number of PVs needing legal review
2. the legal unit's review capacity is increased. Given the lawyers are already working at high capacity, the only way to
do this is by having more lawyers.
We understand meetings were held at the CEP today to find ways of addressing this issue.

-we have observed differences in the quality and efficiency of the lawyers' review. Some are faster and more thorough
than others. Overall, all are getting tired and it is being noticed in their work.

Best,
SK

+At current rate - attorneys process about 800 PVs daily - the attorneys must ramp up review to make March 3I deadline
for preliminary results;

+We observed the attorneys thoroughly revewing PVs, taking about 5 minutes to review legislative PVs, typically without
the partial electoral lists, which are appended to the presidential PVs whose review take about 6-7 minutes, as the
attorneys check the national identification numbers using bar code scanners;

+In order to increase production, logically, the attorneys will have to spend less time on each PV, perhaps at the expense
of quality;

+We will watch closely whether attorneys maintain quality as they increase production;

- nearly all PVs have been received.

- the backlog of PVs continues at the legal unit. The PVs are reviewed by 6-8 lawyers per shift.

- the CTV will remain open 24hrs a day as long as needed to accommodate for the legal review process. CTV leadership is
monitoring this review closely. We, as well as other observers, also have been watching this process closely.

- we requested, with other observers, daily briefings to be held by CTV leadership, as stipulated in CTV procedures. The
first briefing is expected to occur tomorrow.

+Progress reports will be posted on the CEP web site, under VTC, every 6 hours;

+Note that CTV management does not intend to divulge the threshold used to accept/reject PVs;

+The higher rejection rate of a low threhshold has increased the attorneys' work load, though we observed what appeared
to be focused examination by the attorneys. Of course, thus, there is considerable backlog of PVs for attorney
examination.

Subject: CTV Update: 3/21

Here are the main updates for today:

         The CTV opened at 6am, but started processing PVs in the early afternoon. Initial tests were run in the morning
         to adjust the threshold number of votes used for referring a PV to the legal unit. This adjustment was necessary
         because the initial threshold, based on first round turn-out, was too strict and quarantined 80% of the PVs. The
         new number was determined based on how many of the initially quarantined PVs were deemed valid by the
         legal unit after review. (Note: Observers have not been informed of the thresholds used.)
         Each department will have a threshold number that can be adjusted over time as more data becomes available
         on voter turn-out. This is in contrast to the first round when the threshold number was fixed and used for all
         departments. The database will automatically refer any PV to the legal control unit based on this threshold
         number.
         We were pleased with the diligence of the lawyers and the smoothness of the process thus far. In addition, OAS
         observers and CTV staff indicated to us that the CTV was much more organized this round. Their impressions
         were that key deficiencies in the process had been addressed.
         Progress reports will be posted daily on the CEP website and daily briefings will be held with CTV leadership.

Best,
SK
