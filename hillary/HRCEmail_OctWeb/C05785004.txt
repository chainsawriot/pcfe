                                           Office of the Press Secretary
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 7, 2011

              Statement by the Press Secretary on Iran's Blockage of Virtual Embassy Tehran

We condemn the Iranian government's efforts to deny their people the freedom to access America's
recently launched Virtual Embassy Tehran. Through this action, the Iranian government has once
again demonstrated its commitment to build an electronic curtain of surveillance and censorship
around its people. The Iranian government's systematic efforts to deny information to its citizens — to
control what the Iranian people see and hear — is doomed to fail in a 21st century when technology is
empowering citizens around the globe.

The United States remains steadfast in our commitment to a dialogue with the Iranian people based
upon mutual interests, mutual respect, and admiration for a great and ancient civilization. The
Iranian government should explain to its own people why it fears their ability to access the
information that they choose.
