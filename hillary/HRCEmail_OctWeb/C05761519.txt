Cheryl

Over the course of the past couple weeks there have been ongoing conversations about hosting a live digital town hall or
series of digital town halls during the Summit of the Americas in the next several weeks. The idea is to use digital media to
effect policy, to educate and to also try and flatten an event largely seen as closed and to also help increase citizen
participation across the hemisphere. This is the same project - I emailed you about this last week and we sat down with
Jake, Philippe and Alec to propose the idea of having S participate and host one in Trinidad on her own.




 If this is OK I will have them reach out. Let me know if you have questions or how I can help elaborate more if needed.

 Thanks
 Katie
