Subject: Turkish warplanes hit Kurdish rebel targets in Iraq-sources (Reuters)

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish warplanes struck Kurdish militant targets in northern Iraq on Wednesday in
response to a guerrilla attack which killed 24 soldiers in southeast Turkey, military sources told Reuters, but it
was unclear what damage they had caused.

   The sources also said military helicopters had transported Turkish commandos across the border and set
them down at strategic points up to 7-8 km within Iraqi territory. Some 500 soldiers were in Iraqi territory in the
region near the attack, they said.
