Subject: Haiti judge: Try Duvalier on corruption charges (AP)

PORT-AU-PRINCE (AP) - A Haitian judge says he is recommending that Jean-Claude Duvalier face trial on
corruption charges but not the more serious human rights violations during his brutal 15-year rule.
  Magistrate Carves Jean says the statute of limitations has run out on the human rights violations that occurred
when the former leader known as "Baby Doc" led the country in the 1970s and 1980s.
   Jean says he will recommend that the corruption case be handled by a special court that handles relatively
minor offenses. The former leader would face no more than five years in prison. He spoke Monday as he turned
the ruling into the court. It must still be reviewed by the attorney general. He did not release the ruling.
