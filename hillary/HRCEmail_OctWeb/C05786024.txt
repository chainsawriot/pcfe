SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea test-fired a short-range missile on its eastern coast on Monday, the day its
leader Kim Jong-il's death was announced, South Korean media reported.

   An unnamed South Korean official was quoted by Yonhap news agency as saying he did not believe the
launch was linked to the announcement of Kim's death.
