Brzenski was very critical of Iran policy this morning on Morning Joe including calling the plot a sting operation that
basically isn't worth discussing and is taking eye off the ball. He said we should be focused, as Graham Allison suggested
in his oped on taking the 20% opening, on engaging with Iran. We could offer Zbig a briefing but wanted to know where
relationship was and if this would be useful. Thanks.
