See below — consistent with what Preval said to us and the point we are trying delicately to balance

I will ask Richard to add to this as he is our point person on this particular issue.

But my quick points of guidance are:

1.    We all agree we are taking on these responsibilities under the direction/authority of the Govt of
Haiti. When I spoke to President Preval yesterday he again highlighted that the govt has very limited capacity.




3.    Our read of the UN proposal is that it is consistent with this concept with two exceptions: 1) they would
have a very large, all-inclusive "overall leadership group" (akin to principals committee) to make sure
everyone is represented (we would worry about this kind of a group being able to set a strong strategic
direction — and would like a structure that allows those that have real assets on the ground to have a more
significant role in overall governance), and 2) we doubt UN OCHA has the capacity to be very
effective/directive very quickly. This might be an incorrect assumption and the current UN sector clusters
under OCHA are doing an important job coordinating but they are not able to develop strong strategic plans
without deeper engagement with USG (military and civilian leadership in Haiti). So this requires a more deep
engagement with USG — both Gen Keen and his team and Amb Lucke and his. We want a structure that allows
people to break out of standard operating procedures — not to be disrespectful of the OCHA clusters but to
make sure we help elevate the ambition and develop plans that fully utilize USG assets.

Richard was going to work with Tony B to bring our two perspectives together.

Hope this is helpful — and I would invite others to comment.

All — I just received an e-version from our team in NYC. In light of the timing for the SYG call to S in a few
minutes, I am attaching here. This also jibes with what NSS staffer in Haiti has as well. Here is the redline
version (these are internal UN edits, so please be careful with this draft). — Erica

All—

The SYG just spoke with Susan.

On Haiti - the SYG said that it was his understanding that SRSG Mulet had agreed in recent conversations to a
coordination plan with Raj, Amb. Merten, and Gen Keen. He said that Mulet has forwarded this "approved"
plan (hereafter "the Mulet plan) and the SYG intends to present it in Montreal for approval. The SYG said that
the Canadians are also on board with the Mulet plan.

Amb. Rice was non-committal with the SYG noting that she had not seen the Mulet plan.

As far as I know, nobody in Washington has seen the Mulet plan.



We need to urgently track down a copy of this plan quickly before the SYG calls the Secretary.

-      Erica

Points for S-UN SyG Ban phone call on Montreal conference

•           Look forward to Montreal conference as way to focus international community on both short-term
relief and longer-term reconstruction effort in Haiti.

•        Next opportunity for Haitian government to convey its priorities on the international stage and
underscore that all efforts are in support of the Government of and people of Haiti.

            Greatly appreciate efforts of newly arrived SRSG Mulet and the entire UN team—both those who
have come in since the earthquake, and those who continue to do outstanding work after going through such
terrible losses to the UN Mission.

•         [Anything else specific we need to highlight/ask of Ban about efforts right now w/UN either on the
ground in Haiti or in NY???]

•          We believe the Montreal meeting must set us on the right course for our reconstruction efforts to
build a better Haiti. Getting our efforts off to the right start is critical. Appropriate and efficient coordination
among international organizations and donors paramount.

•         For this reason we hope that a donors conference will be announced at the end of the meeting,
which the United States will offer to host.

•          [If Ban mentions UN plan and architecture for coordination: We appreciate that the UN is thinking
about this. Our views are very similar, and we look forward to hearing more details, recognizing that no
decisions on these issues will be taken on Monday.]

Background: UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon wishes to speak to you in preparation for the Canadian-
convened meeting on Haiti in Montreal January 25. He has reached out to the Canadians as well and indicated
that Special Representative Mulet will be bringing with him a "plan and architecture for coordination." We
know nothing further on details. The Canadians have told Ban that they welcome the UN thinking about this
and will take a hard look.
