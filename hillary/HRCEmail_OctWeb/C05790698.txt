This prestigious addition to your otherwise thin resume, could really make THE difference when you're interviewing for
jobs next year. But I still think Our Grammy is way cooler.

Learning more about the academy will be my research project for tomorrow (right after I get to the bottom of the hotel
bathrobe mystery). But I'm thinking you could form a study group with fellow 2012 inductees Penny Pritzker and George
Stephanopoulos.

Speaking of awards, here's what I was referring to from the NYT... "Mr. Gettleman nominated himself for the award, and
he beat out other Times reporters nominated for their coverage of the Japanese tsunami. While 'some reporters might
have felt his editors knew best' about the nomination, said Joseph Kahn, The Times's foreign editor, 'Jeffrey put himself
forward for the Pulitzers = and for that, Jeffrey, bless your heart."

The Pulitzers release said he won for "his vivid reports, often at personal peril, on famine and conflict in East Africa, a
neglected but increasingly strategic part of the world."

Lastly, Betsy explained their connection as... "My sister Terry's husband, Malcolm's brother Kenny's daughter Courtnay's
husband. "

It is the top academic honor other than being in the National Academy of Sciences; they also have a small and very elite
category for public servants. There is a beautiful Japanese style building in Cambridge where it is headquartered; they
run study groups and projects on important academic and policy issues. You can be a member of a study group without
being a member of the Academy, but they are run by members of the Academy. I don't think there are dues; they
publish the magazine Daedalus which you get for free. But really, it's all about the honor of the thing. They have an
elaborate induction ceremony at some point in the fall, but unless you wanted to give a speech there, I doubt you would
go. I'll send you the list of people admitted this year. I just love the idea of being fellow members.

I had no idea. What a nice surprise. What does it mean? And can you use to facilities for events? Meals? Are there dues?
I am, as you can tell, quite clueless.

Welcome to the august ranks of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. I am proud to be a fellow member! I'm
looking forward to your being back in New York next year so that we can do at least some projects together.
All best,
AM
