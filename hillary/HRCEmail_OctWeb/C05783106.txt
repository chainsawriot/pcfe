Subject: Arab League: Disaster in Syria if peace plan fails (AP)


CAIRO - (AP) The head of the Arab League is warning that the failure of an Arab-brokered plan to end the
violence in Syria would have disastrous consequences.
   Secretary-General Nabil Elaraby expressed "deep worries and regret for the continuation of violence all
around Syria."
  The Arab peace plan unraveled on Friday as Syrian security forces killed more than 15 people among
thousands of protesters who took to the streets to test whether the regime was serious about ending violence
against protesters.
  Elaraby warned Saturday that "the failure of the Arab solution will have disastrous consequences in Syria and
the region."
   He urged the Syrian government to take "immediate measures ... to protect civilians."
   The uprising against President Bashar Assad began in mid-March.
