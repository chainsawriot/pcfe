No, I haven't. I just did a search and have nothing from you before today. Did it appear on you email that they went thru
to me?

Just curious whether you received the emails I sent to you over the past 2 months, re; pakistan, doug holloway, etc.
Nothing urgent they were informational only but I am concerned our emails may be hitting some tech glitch.

 A few odds and ends--

  Have you heard of the Ben Franklin awards for public diplomacy? I saw a reference to them and don't know what they
are.

 Have you connected w Georgetown Prof and former Amb Cynthia Schneider? She has written and worked on cultural
engagement in the Muslim world and wants to help.

                                                                                                              If so,
when would you be ready to do it?

 All the best--H
