Dear Cheryl,

The Secretary's video message was played today on a jumbotron during the memorial service marking the first
anniversary of the Christchurch earthquake.

The service was held in Hagley Park, a two-minute walk from the George Hotel. Present were the Prime Minister, the
Governor General, most of the Cabinet, families of the victims, and approximately 20,000 Christchurch citizens.

The video was extraordinarily well received at the event, and it was prominently featured on the evening news reports
and related websites. I received dozens of expressions of thanks at the event, including from the Prime Minister,
followed by many more expressions of gratitude on our electronic media platforms.

I would be grateful if you could convey those and my personal thanks to the Secretary for recording the video despite all
the other demands on her time. Her message was pitch-perfect, personal, and powerful, and it will be long remembered
and appreciated here in New Zealand.

Best regards,

D
