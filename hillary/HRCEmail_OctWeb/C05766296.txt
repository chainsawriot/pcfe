Hillary,




On another update, we're trying to address the Hyman Ornish proposal through an upcoming CMS rule that
affects many kinds of procedures, though we're wrangling about whether it can address their entire program.
Their program was scored as a major cost by CBO (and our actuaries) so they chose to forgo the full-blown
legislative route. Nevertheless, Senate Finance committed $100 million to lifestyle-based interventions. So
there's some progress, and I'm hopeful through rules changes, we can accomplish much, if not all, of what they
want to do.

Hope you're getting some rest. You were great on Face the Nation.

Neera
