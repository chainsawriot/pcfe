Strobe--Since I talked to them and told them I'd follow up w you, I'd prefer talking to you myself if you can let me know
when it would be convenient. I could also make early Sat morning before 10am work. Thx.

Dear Strobe,

Brian Greenspun and Paul Cejas briefed me on your trip and their discussions about Alan Gross which I'd like to discuss
w you.

I could talk tomorrow night after 6 or Friday after noon if there's a time then that works for you.

All the best, H
