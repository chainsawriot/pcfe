LONDON (AP) - Somalia's prime minister says an international conference in London could mark the end of
two-decades of chaos and violence in his impoverished country.
   Abdiweli Mohamed Ali said Wednesday that conflict-scarred Somalia was "moving from an era of
warlordism, terrorism, extremism and piracy," and toward "stability and normalcy."
   About 50 nations and organizations will attend a one-day summit Thursday in London, including Ali's United
Nations-backed transitional government, United States Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and the U.N.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.
   British Prime Minister David Cameron said talks are aimed at showing international support for efforts to
tackle piracy, terrorism and poverty in Somalia "to give that country a second chance."
