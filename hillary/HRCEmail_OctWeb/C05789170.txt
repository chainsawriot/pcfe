Subject: RE: Ulema Counel's declaration on women

Sir, Eileen just replied on separate email chain with this information. I've pasted the language from the Ulema statement
below that, along with an update on what the Political section has been working today on this.

Eileen's Note
Just in case you didn't see it: Herewith attached is the original Ulama Statement, translated by the President's office and
issued last week. He endorsed this today by an answer to a question at the press conference held with the Polish
President. Ambassador Cunningham had been told at the UNAMA breakfast by a MoFA person that the Palace would
issue something "walking this back." That did not happen as far as we can see and in fact, he praised the Ulama's overall
work as "wise." Eileen

Political's Take
Heera Kamboj in POL has been engaged with civil society contacts all day today on this via phone, and will be sending a
cable in to the Department by mid-day tomorrow. She's already alerted the desk and DRL about the issue and that a
cable is coming.

At this moment, Heera reports that civil society is mobilizing and plans to meet with MPs, and high-level GIRoA women
to discuss the statement and what to do. They do not want it to seem as if just civil society is complaining. One of
Heera's contacts said if CS groups push too hard on it or ask for clarification, that the government or Ulema Council
could turn around and make something that was a statement into a law/edict — they want to avoid this. General

consensus — this is not good (and that was before the news that the Palace had issued a statement backing the Ulema
Council). POL LES was also approached on this by Fawzia Koofi today at parliament.

Strother Murray points out that MPs and women's groups themselves need to engage directly with the Palace and the
Ulema Council about their legitimate concerns, and some of them seem to be doing that. We were planning to set up a
meeting with Amb. Olson and female MPs sometime next week anyway; that would be a good opportunity to engage.

Language on women from the Ulema Council statement issued March 2 (per PAS, some press have mistranslated this
and have said that the statement says beating is OK, per Sharia)

5-The religion of Islam is contrary to other nations and human civilizations of the current era and the pas. It has a lot of
respect for women and Islam believes that women are the foundation of the civil society and should be granted respect
and human dignity. In the past centuries and before Islam, women had been deprived of any respect and human
rights. Women were sold like goods and even buried alive under the ground. After the appearance of the Islam sunshine,
Islamic religion granted a lot of rights to women as follow:

A- The ownership and trade rights

B- The inheritance right according to Islam.

C- The Maher [Islamic dowry] is the specific right of the women and nobody has the right to take over that right from
the women. Some people have practicing dowry [Toiana and walwar in Dad and Pashto] which against the Islamic
Sharia.

D- The right of choosing the husband and nobody can force a woman to marry against her wishes but the parents' advice
is allowed according to the Islamic principles.

E- Women have the same dignity and respect as men, no one can give away women as compensation for peace, killing
any person, it is unlawful in Islam.

F- No one can get women as inheritance. The women have several rights according to the Islam religion, the women
beside having many rights in Islam they have some responsibilities and obligation as well such as:

A- Women should follow all Islamic Sharia in faith and practice.

B- Wearing veil according to the Islamic Sharia which give more respect and dignity to the woman.

C- Stay away from strangers and unknown men during education, social relation and other interactions.

D- According to Aia 1 Sora 34 of the Holy Quran which indicate that male is the base [Principal] and women is a
corollary [Not base]

E- Multiple marriages is allowed according to Islam.

F- Avoidance of travel without lawful man

G- Divorce right according to Mohammadi Sharia

 It is worth mentioning that beating, abuse, harassment of the women is unlawful, any kind of the abuse, misconduct and
 rape against women is illegal and it is unlawful and the Afghanistan requests the legislative and judicial institutions to
 punish and bring to justice according to approved Afghan government laws and Mohammadi Shari those who commit
 crimes against women. In the Islamic religious books, a lot of information are published about the women rights and
 obligation which any one can refer to it when there is a need for it.

Karzai told me last night he had rejected the part on women in the Council statement, and it was not in the version
released by the Palace.

Subject: Ulema Counel's declaration on women

I participated in an event with Sima Samar yesterday at the World Bank and she told me that the Ulema Council just
promulgated new bans regulating women's conduct. I have been trying to get more information and understand that
their pronouncement hit the Afghan press today. What I understand is that, among other items, they called for a
separation between women and men during work hours and in education, banned women traveling without a male
escort, recommended the imposition of complete adherence to the hijab, adherence to Sharia, including in divorce
(whose interpretation is always key), and it looks like polygamy is respected as well. Perhaps the worst part of all of this
is the approval by Karzai. We need an exact readout as I've put this together from the various reports I've received.

I have been hearing from several of the women activists who see this as a very troubling reassertion of the Taliban
mentality on these issues, and they view Karzai's assent to be of particular concern. Moreover, they are noting that this
is in contradiction of the Afghan constitution's guarantee of equality between men and women and a bad omen for their
future.

We may begin to get press questions as this gets picked up.

Finally, as you know Karzai had asked a few months ago for the resignation of those on the Human Rights Commission
whose terms were up. Sima told me that he basically told her that the Commission has been too independent (they are
the Independent Human Rights Commission). Although no new members have been named and the Incumbents
continue to serve, it is not clear how much new control over their work Karzai is intending to seize.
