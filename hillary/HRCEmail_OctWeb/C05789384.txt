Subject: Dinner with Kofi Annan


Last night's dinner was broad ranging, with (I admit) interesting observations by the Russian ambassador who just
completed four and a half years in Syria and knew all the Syrian players personally.


The five permanent ambassadors were there, along with Annan's personnel from his Foundation and some of Nabil's
senior staff. Al Kidwa wasn't there, and I gather than Annan is still thinking about asking Jean Marie Guehenno to be
his second deputy. The main message from the former Secretary General was that the permanent members should
reach out to the various opposition groups and encourage them to engage with him. He feared that the drumbeat of
military intervention — which he opposed — will make some of them refuse to sit down and talk, if they can just wait for
military action. (He was careful not to call it negotiate.)


                        There was some back and forth about the SNC and whether they could play this unifying
role. Annan said he didn't quite know what to expect until he got to Syria and became engaged with the players. To



           Like Jeff Feltman, Annan thought the business community could exercise influence on Bashar, but they had
failed to do so to date. I thought Kofi was clearly going in the direction of a unity government, but it was clear he would
seek a ceasefire.                                                                                                          1.4(B)
                                                                                                                           1.4(D)
Re humanitarian access, there is a meeting of major humanitarian NGOs this week in Brussels and the Arab league is B1
mobilizing Arab humanitarian groups to be ready when access is granted. (Steph, check this point with the AL on
Saturday. ) This was a follow up meeting to the London conference. Both Annan and Nabil agreed that humanitarian
access must be the priority.


Regarding the political settlement, there was some discussion of driving a wedge between Bashar and members of his
family.




Nabil said he needed a UN resolution quickly to allow for peacekeepers (he calls it something like "an appropriate
mechanism for monitoring"). He and Annan had some back and forth about where the peacekeepers could come from
and what existing PKO missions they might be taken from. Nabil said they could be taken from an existing UN PKO
mission, probably in AF, which would be quicker, and they could get several hundred "peacekeepers" into Horns
quickly.
