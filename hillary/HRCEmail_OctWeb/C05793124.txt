Madam Secretary,
I am sure Bill and Jake are filling you in but thought it important to summarize where I think we are before you talk with
Cathy Ashton or, if you have already, what is state of play. I write from Delhi on my way to Patna in Bihar after breakfast
with amb. Burleigh and Dr. Kim who is here today for meetings.

                                                                                                                              1.4(D)
                                                                                                                              B1
                                                                                                                              B5

I can be reached through ops if you wish to discuss further. Very much appreciate your talking with Cathy to try to move
forward.

Best,
Wendy
