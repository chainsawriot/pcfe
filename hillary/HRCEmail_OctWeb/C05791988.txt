Dear Hillary:

An extraordinary start to 2010. So much to say about it. Huge challenges for the West. But a huge opportunity too to
escape some of the demons; and an inspiring civilian surge in its bravery, dignity and respect. (It's interesting how
unsure the Chinese are what to make of it all).

This note is to raise two things.

First, I wanted to get to you direct that I will be in DC for 27/28/29/30 April. I am speaking on the night of Friday 29th at
the New America Foundation Annual Retreat and will probably attend that on Saturday 30th. But if you were available in
that period it would be a good opportunity to meet up. I have let Lois know and my office have contacted yours.

if those dates don't work but you have another slot for dinner let me know and I could come over and build things
around it.

Second, I have had a request to auction a signed copy (by you) of the Act repealing Don't Ask Don't Tell for the Labour
Party Gay Rights Fundraising Dinner. Don't know if this would violate your Madam Secretary position, in which case I
understand, but if not it would be a great thing.

Good luck amidst the sea of challenges.

Best wishes.

David
