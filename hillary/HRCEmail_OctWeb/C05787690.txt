Dear Monica and Rob--

I will start sending you requests and you can divide them btw yourselves and then let me know later which subjects each
of you want to deal with. Thx.

1) Pls look for two studies one by the Boston Consulting Group about American jobs being brought back to the US and
another about Otis Elevator bringing back production

2) Pls send a note to Hays Sullivan just telling him I'm thinking of him and that one of you will be his contact now that
Lauren has left.

3) Pls ask the library for these books: The House that Goes Dancing and The Wind Blows

4) Pls find a copy of a NYTimes article by Bill Keller about why he supported the Iraq war

5) Did I write a condolence letter to Sharon Rockefeller for the death of her father?

6) I'd like to see the PBS documentary series on Women, War and Peace so can you get me DVDs?

7) Pls look at NYTimes article on The Good Banker (sometime in last two months) about Rob Wilmers whom I know from
NY and draft letter from me
