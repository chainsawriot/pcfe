Hi, Cheryl! Hope you're doing well.

As I mentioned a couple of weeks ago, the NASA Administrator, Charlie Bolden, and his Deputy, Lori Garver, would like
to meet with the Secretary regarding NASA's engagement with China in civil space activities, which I know is of
importance to her. He would also like to talk to her about his strong interest in working with the Department of State
and other agencies to enhance NASA's international cooperation with non-traditional partners in the Middle East, Asia,
Africa, and Latin America. Can you help to set that up or shoot me a point of contact with whom I can work to put a
brief visit together?

Attached for your reference is Gen. Bolden's biography. If there's anything further you need from me, please don't
hesitate to let me know.

Thanks, as always.

JFH.



P.S.: Thanks again for putting me in touch with Andrew Shapiro. I look forward to working with him on potential
solutions to the ITAR-related challenges NASA and its contractors are experiencing.
