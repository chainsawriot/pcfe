Reb Brownell of Sen McConnell's office called yesterday and left a message. He said McConnell spoke to ASSK yesterday
morning. He did not provide full read-out, but ASSK apparently suggested McC put off giving his speech on Burma until
after S returns from her trip rather than next week as originally planned. Brownell said McC will honor her
suggestion. Brownell said he still wants to coordinate speech language with me as the senator wants to be supportive of
S's efforts. I'll be on the road but can work from there. Have a call into Brownell to get more details on the call but as
yet unsuccessful.
