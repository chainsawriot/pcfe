If you can help him be prepped, and I can follow-up with him, I think we'll take your vouching for him.

Can you reach out to him to see if he's available â€” if so, I can send him an email invite today and begin the dialog.

Best.

Subject: I would highly reco Chris Gardner ...The Pursuit of Happyness,




I know Chris and his message and personal story of what The Declaration of Independence
declares life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness to be inalienable rights... is powerful and
even more powerful now. I think with all that is happening in the World his message would
be spot on and it also fits your purpose "To give people the opportunity to live up to their
God-given potential." I do not know availability but I can help if you all agree-I could also
work in topics that YOU would like for him to stress...he would be great! Let me know....lf you
want me to think of others too.

{Chris Gardner The Pursuit of Happyness, Christopher Paul Gardner (born February 9, 1954 in
Milwaukee, Wisconsin) is an American entrepreneur, investor, stockbroker, motivational
speaker, author, and philanthropist who, during the early 1980s, struggled with homelessness
while raising his toddler son, Christopher, Jr. Gardner credits his tenacity and success to the
"spiritual genetics" handed down to him by his mother, Bettye Jean Triplett. Gardner's
personal struggle of establishing himself as a stockbroker while managing fatherhood and
homelessness is portrayed in the 2006 motion picture The Pursuit of Happyness, starring Will
Smith.}
