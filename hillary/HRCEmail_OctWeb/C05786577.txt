Sorry I am slow to respond. I was in Rio for the last of five July 4 celebrations.

I am sorry to go on so long. I have more I could say. I will be on R and R beginning tomorrow, but I can be reached on my
BB. I will be in DC July 7-12 and July 25-August 1. Always happy to talk.

Tom:

Jake and I would be interested in your thoughts - this memo, per S's conversation with Luis Moreno
has been shared with her- we have not yet tasked out to the building, so not yet for forwarding,
discussion or circulation.

Best.
