Subject: Indonesia PNB

Madame Secretary -

Thank you for meeting with Asep Sulaeman, the Chairman of the local PNB Committee in Indonesia and the Sr VP for
Exxon Mobil in Jakarta and Robin McClellan, a newly retired FSO who was the CG in Perth, Australia and is now
employed by Exxon.

You briefly met Asep during the PNB dinner earlier this year and I spent time with them both in Jakarta last month.
Indonesia promises to be a successful PNB country because like Turkey, a number of US companies are interested in
participating.                                                                                                            B4


Your "hello" and statement that PNB is an important item on your agenda will allow                                         B4
                                        he funding will help them hire a full time Exec Director to run the project. We
are helping them develop a mechanism to accept the funds and move forward.

                                                                                       She and I have talked about how    B6
to move forward.

Thnx and safe travels.

Kris
