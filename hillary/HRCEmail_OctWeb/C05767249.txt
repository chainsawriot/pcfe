Subject: Inter-agency working group proposal

Cheryl, at tomorrow's meeting, all agencies will present ideas for improving procedures. Because we do work so closely
together, changes by individual agencies are bound to impact on others.                                       it would
be great if the Secretary could suggest the formation of an interagency working group to discuss/coordinate
changes. I've asked that such a recommendation be included in the paper that is going to S in preparation for
tomorrow's meeting.
