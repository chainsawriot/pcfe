Subject: UN, Iraq agree on Camp Ashraf resettlement plan (AP)

BAGHDAD (AP) - The United Nations says it has signed an agreement with the Iraqi government to move a
group of Iranian exiles living in a camp in northeastern Iraq.
  In a statement late Sunday, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq said the agreement establishes a
process to move the residents to a temporary location.
  From there, the UN's refugee agency will process them with the idea of eventually resettling them in another
country.
  The exiles live in a camp northeast of Baghdad and are dedicated to overthrowing the Iranian government.
  But the Iraqi government, which would like to shore up relations with Iran, sees them as an irritant and has
been pushing to close the camp.
