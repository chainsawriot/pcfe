Hi Cheryl,

First of all, thanks so much for convening the group to discuss our plans for the US Diplomacy Center.

I came away with the impression that everyone who attended felt that it would be an important part of the Secretary's
legacy for the foreign service and for all those who work in the diplomatic arena.

We'll look forward to receiving some additional tweaks from S/P on the themes which will be incorporated into the
exhibits, as well as to a communications strategy from Philippe.

In the meantime, when you speak to the Secretary about this, you might mention that Secy Jim Baker is very
enthusiastic about the Center and has committed $1 million personally, $500,000 of which is already in hand, and has
helped us with several companies and spoken personally to Henry Kissinger, who is also helping us. So it is a true bi-
partisan effort as well as a public/private partnership! Since we need them both on other issues like Law of the Sea,
etc., it would be very awkward if we didn't finish the job.

Thanks again for your leadership and support, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best,

Elizabeth
