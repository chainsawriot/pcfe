I'm very pleased to announce that we've had a breakthrough in negotiations in Honduras.

I want to congratulate the people of Honduras as well as President Zelaya and Mr. Michelleti for reaching an historic '
agreement. I also congratulate Costa Rican President Oscar Arias for the important role he has played in fashioning the
San Jose process and the OAS for its role in facilitating the successful round of talks.

As you know I sent Assistant Secretary Tom Shannon and his deputy Craig Kelly, and the White House NSC
representative for the Western Hemisphere Dan Ristreppo to Honduras yesterday after speaking with both President
Zelaya and Mr. Micheletti last Friday to urge them finally, once and for all to reach an agreement.

Jcannot think of another example of a country in Latin America that having suffered a rupture of its democratic and
consitutional order overcame such a crisis through negotiation and dialogue.

This is a big step forward for the Inter-American system and its commitment to democracy as embodied in the Inter-
American democratic charter. I'm very proud that I was part of the process, that the United States was instrumental in
the process. But I'm mostly proud of the people of Honudras who have worked very hard to have this matter resolved
peacefully.


We're looking forward to the elections that will be held on November 29, and working with the people and government
of Honduras to realize the full return of democracy and a better future for the Honduran people.
