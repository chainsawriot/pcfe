Cheryl,

   I spoke to Treasury just now and told them a much more constructive way to discuss the USG contribution
to the HRF would be to

                                                                           They took the point but said the train is
out of the station.                                                            Treasury will be sending around an
email, probably later today,
                                                                                                     Sorry I couldn't
turn it off.

Best, Roland
