RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has banned all protests and marches, state television on Saturday cited the
Interior Ministry as saying after Saudi minority Shi'ites staged small protests in the oil-producing eastern
province.

  Security forces would use all measures to prevent any attempt to disrupt public order, state news channel al-
Ekhbariya said in an alert without giving details.
