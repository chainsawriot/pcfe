    Subject: Egypt sees Clinton remarks as "interference"-agency (Reuters)

    CAIRO (Reuters) - The Egyptian foreign minister said on Wednesday that Egypt would not accept any
    interference in its internal affairs, in response to criticism by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on the way
    security forces dealt with women protesters.

       In a speech on Monday, Clinton criticised the actions of Egyptian security forces as showing the "systematic
    degradation" of women that "disgraces the state", some of the strongest U.S. language used against Egypt's new
    rulers.

       Footage showed Egyptian soldiers beating protesters with batons, often after they had fallen to the ground, in
    what activists described as a forcible attempt to clear a sit-in demanding a swifter transfer to civilian rule. The
    clashes since Friday have left at least 13 dead and hundreds wounded.

       "Egypt does not accept any interference in its internal affairs and conducts communications and
    clarifications concerning statements made by foreign officials," the state news agency quoted Foreign Minister
    Mohame d Kamel Amr as saying.

       "Matters like that are not taken lightly," he was quoted as saying, in his response to a question about
    Clinton's remarks.

       A video of Egyptian soldiers dragging a woman protester on the ground by her black full-body veil;
    exposing her bra, then clubbing and kicking her has sparked outrage. Thousands marched on Tahrir square on
    Tuesday to condemn the attacks.
