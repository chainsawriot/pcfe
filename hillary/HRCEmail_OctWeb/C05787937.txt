Subject: Re: ceasefire and prisoners

Equally important with all the developments this week is the ceasefire with the knu. This is the world's longest runningg
insurgency and the knu, has fought ever iteration of the gob- aung san and the japanese, u nu, ne win, than shwe, thein
sein.

We met with zipporah sein, the general secretary of the knu. Contrary to the report below, a ceasefire agreement haas
been signed and the group will release a press statement later. I showed her the statements below and she said 'yes, a
ceasefire.' She said yes three times.

We'll see what happens here among the knu leadership.

Additionally, the agreement was signed yesterday. The knu has 11 points they need to discuss further with the gob in
order to move forward; the timeframe will be about 45 days. Among the 11 points is cooperation with local people,
nationwide ceasefire, stop to violence, establish a federal union, and start a political dialogue. We did not get the
complete list of the 11. These details will be discussed further at the national level. This stage, they want to build trust.

Just a point- the knu, unlike the kachin, do not represent the karen as a whole. The karen groups are filled with factions.
Peace with the knu is a great step, a sorely needed one, and perhaps can lay the groundwork for others in karen state
and elsewhere on forging agreeable peace deals.
We just got a call from our shan contact from our previous meeting who also confirmed the release of khun tun oo and
'others'. Doug I see has just provided an updated list. We will continue to confirm with the people here.

Saw David Thrac Kabaw, the Karen National Union vice-chairmen told Karen News that no ceasefire agreement has yet
been signed with the Burma government delegation despite numerous media stories.




Burma's Railway Minister, U Aung Min is in charge of the government's delegation while the Karen National Liberation
Army chief of staff, General Mutue Sae Poe, leads the KNU delegation.




"It is disingenuous of the Railway Minister, Aung Min, to say so. He does not have the mandate to sign anything. He is
overstepping his authority and at this stage is talking too much — only Burma's President Thein Sein can ratify a ceasefire
agreement and for the KNU it is our Central Committee."




Saw David Thrac Kabaw questioned the rational and the timing behind the Railway Minister's statement to the media
claiming the ceasefire is a done deal.




"It's easy to promise everything, I question why he's {Railway minister] such a hurry to get a ceasefire with the Karen.
We are now entering the dry season and with a ceasefire in place, I imagine the Burma Army will be in hurry to resupply
their 200 army camps in Karen State."
