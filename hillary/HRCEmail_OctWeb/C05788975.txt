Subject: 158 Peace Corps volunteers leave Honduras (AP)

TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras - (AP) The entire Peace Corps delegation in Honduras has left the country weeks
after the United States decided to pull them out of for safety reasons.
   U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Ledy Pacheco says 158 volunteers have left the Central American country
notorious for the world's highest homicide rate.
   Honduras President Porfirio Lobo said Monday that the group was affected by rising crime, but he and the
U.S. haven't specified attacks.
   The Peace Corps had operated in Honduras since 1963.
   In December, Peace Corps announced it was bringing home volunteers from Honduras and suspending
training for new volunteers in El Salvador and Guatemala. The region is plagued by drug gang violence.
   Volunteers remain in the other two countries.
