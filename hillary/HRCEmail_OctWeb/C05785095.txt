Subject:                         Somalia



Ban Ki-Moon was in Mogadishu today and announced that the UN Political Office for Somalia will be re-locating from
Nairobi to Mogadishu. We've been pushing the UN to make that move for years, so small victory for us (and the UK,
who has also been pushing that).
