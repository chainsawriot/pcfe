Subject: ISAF says drone lost over Afghanistan late last week (Reuters)

BONN (Reuters) - A surveillance drone flying over western Afghanistan had gone out of control late last week
and may be the one Iran said it had shot down over its own airspace, the International Security Assistance Force
(ISAF) said December 4.

    "The UAV to which the Iranians are referring may be a U.S. unarmed reconnaissance aircraft that had been
flying a mission over western Afghanistan late last week. The operators of the UAV lost control of the aircraft
and had been working to determine its status," an ISAF statement said.

   The statement about the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was issued in Kabul and released to reporters
covering an international conference on Afghanistan in the German city Bonn.
