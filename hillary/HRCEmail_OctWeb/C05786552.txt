The Last Best Chance to Save Yemen
President's Departure Provides Window of Opportunity

By Ken GudE-, Ken Sofer

Yemeni President Ali Adbullah Saleh's forced departure to Saudi Arabia to receive urgent medical care
provides the United States and its allies an unexpected opportunity to end the violent, multisided fighting
gripping the poorest Arab nation.

The United States must move beyond mere calls for Saleh to relinquish power and put in place a package of
punitive actions and incentives to use what little leverage it has to try and head off more violence and genuinely
improve the conditions in Yemen after Saleh goes. This package should include:

      •    Urging all parties to abide by the cease-fire while Saleh is out of the country and pressing Saudi Arabia
           to delay or prevent him from returning to Yemen
      •    Proposing a revised transition plan based on Gulf Cooperation Council framework but transferring
           authority over security services away from the Saleh family and maintaining right of peaceful protest
      •    Suspending military assistance and weapons transfers while the Yemeni government shoots its own
           people
      •    Imposing targeted travel, financial, and other economic sanctions on Saleh, his family, and other senior
           figures that remain in his government in an effort to further isolate them

    • Capitalize on the lull in fighting to announce an immediate humanitarian relief effort to help the Yemeni
      people, who were already suffering from a dire humanitarian situation before the recent crisis has
      accelerated Yemen's economic spiral
    • Announcing a package of economic and development assistance for a post-Saleh Yemen
