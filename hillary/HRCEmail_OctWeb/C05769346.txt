Allâ€”

Ahead of Monday and while I was thinking of it and in the interest of transparency, I just wanted to make sure to have
closed an important loop.




Again, no reason to believe we are internally cross wise, but just wanted to be sure everyone had maximum visibility as
we are all going a 1000 mph in different directions.

Thanks.
Dan
