I'm at the Halifax International Security Forum. In answer to a Palestinian question about the US vetoing their UN
petition for statehood, John McCain answered, on the record: "There is only one man on the planet who could possibly
get the Israelis and the Palestinians and that is Bill Clinton. You won't get anywhere w/ your statehood petition."

I'm jealous of your trip to Burma; it is a historic breakthrough given Burma's strategic location and what it opens up re
ASEAN.

All best, and a longer email w/ some ideas we can discuss in December coming soon.
