SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED


BUDGET


      •    Jack noted that the Secretary's calls to the Hill had been difficult insofar as while they all want to help, the
           political reality and numbers make it difficult. He added that our message has to be that, notwithstanding what
           the Hill may think, cuts of the magnitude they propose will impact our ability to do our jobs in Af/Pak and
           Iraq. In terms of an immediate way forward, Jack suggested we would focus on getting what we can in terms of
           fee retention in the Supplemental, which would address roughly 20% of our problem.

      •    Rich said he has draft language for a letter from Secretary Gates he will pass to Cheryl. He also noted that a
           letter from the Secretary to the budget committees will go up to the Hill this morning.

BISHKEK


      •    Eric Boswell reported the situation in Kyrgyzstan remains fluid and Embassy Bishkek will request Authorized
           Departure for non-essential personnel.

CONGRESSIONAL ISSUES


      •    We were allowed in quiet to peek at the current mark-up of the Iran Sanctions Resolution which goes about half
           way in meeting our concerns, Rich said.

      •    Lael Brainard's cloture vote yesterday was 84-10.

      •    Raj Shah testifies today before SAFCO on the FY2011 budget. Raj and Jack testify tomorrow on food security.



LEGAL ISSUES


      •    ICJ Prosecutor Moreno Ocampo is in town for interagency meetings.

                     Cheryl suggested we needed to engage the WH and                                                      She    B5
           asked Harold for a one-page summary of the issue, with examples, she could share.

VOLCANIC ASH AND TRAVEL

   •       I said that we are setting up a Monitoring Group with CA, EEB, PA and others to focus on the issue of stranded
           American travelers. About 60% of the normal flight volume in Europe is expected today, but London remains
           closed with an estimated 40,000 Americans stranded. There are no easy solutions, but we will work closely with
           the airlines to ensure they are laying on additional flights when possible, and will look at other alternatives for
           those stuck in London should the situation persist.

DEPUTIES MEETING — HIGHLIGHTS

EUR

   •        April 24 is Armenian Remembrance Day. The Armenians will likely put out a genocide statement well in advance
            of April 24. Armenian-American groups will also open the new Armenian Genocide Museum just blocks from
            the WH before April 24.




      •     No progress on Mexican Trucking.                                  The model BIT is also stuck. Jack said that
            the only trade-related item that appeared to have much of a chance right now is ROZs.

EAP

      •     Swedes will likely have access to the American citizen in N. Korea, but he has been moved two hours south of
            Pyongyang, likely to a labor camp.

PRM

      •     Eric reported on the table top exercise on Haitian mass migration yesterday. He noted that there were a couple
            of lessons learned and will be sending S a note.

WHA

      •     Arturo noted the upcoming Calderon visit and the likelihood that the Mexicans will adopt targeted retaliatory
            sanctions if we don't resolve the trucking issue. Jack said he would like to hold a meeting to start discussing
            deliverables and issues in anticipation of the visit.

SRAP

      •     SRAP outlined planning for the visit of President Karzai from May 10-14, including a full day in the Department
            on the 10th                                                  They are still working on Hill engagement.
