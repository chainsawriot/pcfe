Per         and his closest advisor:                                                                                 1.4(D)

A) resignation of whole government (not just the PM) will be announced tomorrow as part of the long-brewing process
to have a government reshuffle (talks about which are ongoing)

B) this is neither a negative nor dramatic development

C) he will continue on as caretaker

D) he will stay on in new government once formed unless line-up that results from the begotiations go really south
