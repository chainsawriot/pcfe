Hi Huma,

I just wanted to recap our discussion yesterday and our plan going forward.

We agreed that the time was too short and the Secretary's schedule too hectic to really do justice to a meeting or a
luncheon to launch the Center in December.

 We agreed that you will talk to Lona and S about a date in mid-January for a launch of the Center with CEO's and
individuals who have already committed, as well as prospective donors, with the Secretary giving remarks in support of
the project.

At the luncheon, probably with 30-40 people, tentatively situated in the Thomas Jefferson Room, we would announce
the project and show a video, which we agreed also needs to be updated, with a prominent role for S in it.
Steve Estrada has already contacted you for the appropriate person to work with to create the new video.

A day or two prior to the luncheon, we would meet with S to do an in-depth pre-brief on the US Diplomacy Center, so
that she's prepared to discuss it and excited about the design and concept, which I'm sure she will be once she's
focussed on it.

We are tentatively looking at two more events in 2012 or early 2013, which we would want S to host: a groundbreaking
ceremony in June, and the laying of the cornerstone with her name on it, in either December or January 2012, one of
which would be accompanied by a dinner with all the former Secretaries of State to celebrate the building of the glass
pavilion on 21st St, which will house the first hall, America in the World.

Per our discussion, I plan to meet with Capricia to solicit her advice and the assistance of her Office of Protocol with
these outreach events.

Please let me know as soon as possible about the dates in mid January for both the luncheon and the meeting with S.

Thanks for all your support.

Have a Happy and relaxing Thanksgiving!

All the best,
