Is there a way to describe the significant civilian surge underway this year and the additional positions we expect to fill
while signalling that given the POTUS decision to add       troops, we will have to keep up and add even more, thereby         B5
signalling our need for all requested approps requests? We should provide Karl w the specific points to help make the
case that supports our passback appeal.

Rich and I and his team did prep sessions with Karl yesterday and today. They were very productive and I will let Rich
chime in here, but set the stage for effective testimony this week. We made sure that Karl and General McCrystal were
familiar with the effective formulations that you and Secretary Gates worked out through the week and in the Sunday
shows you taped yesterday.
