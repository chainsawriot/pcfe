We are moving the bilateral now to a room with windows and moving up the press avail so give you more breathing
room.

We traditionally do press avails at our ministerials so kept with that pattern esp since we are hosting -- taking three
questions.

The plan is to do the Dai brief at your dining room table.

We have reached out to Amr, waiting to hear back.

Pls find a place w natural light for this bilat.

Also, why am I doing a press avail and could we do brief in car from CEO forum and move up time so I could have a little
breathing room around the Dai brief? How many questions from press? Where is Dai brief?

Did we schedule phone call to Amr?

What's my schedule tomorrow?
