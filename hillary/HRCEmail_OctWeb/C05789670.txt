The AMISOM increase UNSCR just passed 15-0.

Further to my other email on Baidoa, AF is trying to confirm the accuracy of the media reports. Embassy Nairobi is
reporting that the Ethiopians and Somalis have captured the city, while Embassy Addis reports the Ethiopians and
Somalis have not reached Baidoa yet.

Subject: UN votes to increase African force in Somalia (AP)

UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The U.N. Security Council has voted unanimously to authorize an increase in the
African Union force in Somalia from 12,000 to about 17,700 and expand its areas of operation in an effort to
intensify pressure on al-Shabab militants.
   A resolution adopted Wednesday by the U.N.'s most powerful body also orders a ban on the export and
import of charcoal from Somalia, which is a significant revenue source for al-Shabab.
   The council adopted the resolution on the eve of a conference on Somalia in London on Thursday, where
senior representatives from more than 40 governments and international organizations are expected to adopt a
new international approach to the country's myriad problems.
