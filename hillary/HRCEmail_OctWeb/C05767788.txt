SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED

1206/1207

    O      Over the weekend, Jack noted,                                        of making an ERMA-like mechanism for 1207
           funding

                  On 1207, Jack noted that the Secretary has agreed to a pilot program and we will signal that to DoD.

QDR

    O      We have to send our comments on the QDR to DoD today.

P Travel

           Bill noted he leaves for Moscow tomorrow then on to Madrid for a meeting with the EU Political Directors and
           New York for a P5+1 Political Directors meeting on Iran.

TSA Screening

           Pi said our posts are in a difficult spot in pushing back on public reaction to the TSA list of countries identified for
           special screening because the list has not been officially released (though it has leaked).
                                                                   Cheryl recommended that he speak to DHS




    O      In the Assistant Secretaries meeting, Judith McHale noted the significant negative fallout from the screening list
           on our broader public diplomacy efforts in particular countries and the Muslim world at large. Johnnie Carson
           seconded her observations, noting that in          the addition of that country to the list has provoked strong
           negative reaction from both our enemies and friends alike, and could impact bilateral relations. Many
           questioned why the whole country was being affected by the actions of one                noting that countries that
           are much larger sources of international terrorists were not included on the list.

Congressional Issues

    O      Rich noted a series of upcoming hearings, most stemming from the attempted Christmas bombing:
               1. Senate Judiciary (1/20) —Janice Jacobs with DHS and FBI.

               2. Senate Foreign Relations (1/20)— focused on counterterrorism in Yemen with Dan Benjamin and Jeff
                  Feltman.
               3. Senate Intelligence (1/21) — Dan Benjamin.
               4. Senate and House Homeland Security (1/27?) —Janice Jacobs.

      •   Rich also said that David Miliband will appear before the SFRC on January 21 in the afternoon to make a
          statement and engage in a "dialogue," followed by an appearance by Richard Holbrooke.

      •   In addition, the WH is proposing that the Secretary and Secretary Gates appear at a breakfast briefing for Hill
          leaders on January 21 to rollout the new export promotion initiative. Rich suggested that if we do this, it be
          billed as a much broader national security breakfast briefing that would touch as well on Iran policy/sanctions,
          START, etc.

      •   With respect to the Iran Sanctions Act, Rich reported that at a special meeting
          suggested that we might not have to launch formal investigations under the Iran Sanctions Act as long as we
          demonstrated forward movement.

Legal Issues

      •




      •   Harold said that Senators McCain and Graham have apparently co-authored a letter objecting to the return of
          GTMO detainees to a number of countries that could be problematic. Rich said that essentially Dan Fried has
          only been allowed to brief the Hill on our efforts once over the past year.

Assistant Secretaries Meeting — Highlights

EAP

      •   China has made public the test of a ground-launched interceptor — not clear if it was successful or not.

Climate Change

      •   Todd said that we are still trying to get as many countries as possible to endorse the Copenhagen Accord. May
          enlist the Secretary to make some calls.

S/SRAP

      •   Karzai's seventeen new cabinet nominees include three women. For the most part, the new group is a
          significant improvement with a few exceptions, including the new proposed

WHA

      •   Chavez' devaluation of the Bolivar is a sign of increasing economic problems.

Somalia

   •      Johnnie predicted that the food situation in Somalia would deteriorate sharply over the next 30 days and could
          lead to significant movement of refugees into Kenya.
