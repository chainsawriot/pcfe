Subject: UK's Hague offers more aid to Libya during visit (AP)

TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) - Britain's foreign secretary says it's "very, very important" to catch Moammar Gadhafi
and other former Libyan regime figures wanted by the International Criminal Court.
   William Hague made the comments Monday during a visit to Tripoli. He also promised more humanitarian
aid and says the final shipment of Libyan cash that had been frozen in the United Kingdom will be returned
soon.
   The longtime Libyan leader remains on the run and fighting with his supporters continues on two fronts more
than two months after Tripoli fell to revolutionary forces. Some believe he might try to flee to another African
country.
   Hague says Britain has been reminding neighboring countries of their responsibility to apprehend and hand
over any regime suspects found on their territory.
