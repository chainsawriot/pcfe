 Re: Moscow Summit/Germany/UK


 1. I have heard authoritatively from Bill Drozdiak, who is in Berlin and has just met with
                                                                                                                         1.4(D)
                                                                                                                         B1




                                           This is the third message I have received from sources about the
 disastrous nature of the Obama trip. Drozdiak also says that the US is totally out of the loop in Berlin--no
 ambassador, no DCM and a political cou nselor who has just arrived. The Germans have nobody to talk to and
 they don't expect to deal seriously with Obama's ambassadorial appointment. We should expect that the
 Germans and Russians will now cut their own separate deals on energy, regional security, etc., and those deals
 will reflect narrow, parochial economic and political needs indifferent to whether or not we deem them to be in
 the broader interest of the Western alliance.
