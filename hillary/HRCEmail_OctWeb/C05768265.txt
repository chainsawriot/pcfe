Subject                           A policy appeal on AIPAC speech

Importance:                       High



Again, I know that we are working these issues               but having just sent in comments on the AIPAC draft, I see
a clear and relatively easy way for you to make a major difference here. I'm not na√Øve about the politics here, but we
have a major opportunity and I hate to see us waste it.
