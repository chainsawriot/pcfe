Lona/Huma/Alice:

As we wrap up one of the more demanding trips the Secretary has been on in awhile, I'd like to propose the
Secretary drop by the Line, the Executive Office, and the Correspondence and Records unit sometime between
now and the end of the year. The whole swing could be finished in less than 15 minutes, with a few minutes in
each of the three locations to say thanks for the support, and it would really help a lot with morale. The most
critical is the line, most of whose employees have spent largely sleepless nights over the past week, but it
would be nice to include the other two adjacent offices, since I don't think the Secretary has visited (but I
defer to you with greater institutional memories).

Many thanks,

Steve
