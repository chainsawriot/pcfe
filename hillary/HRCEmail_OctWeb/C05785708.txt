Who made the decision that State will not use the terms "mother and father" and instead substitute "parent one and
two"? I'm not defending that decision, which I disagree w and knew nothing about, in front of this Congress. I could live
w letting people in nontraditional families choose another descriptor so long as we retained the presumption of mother
and father. We need to address this today or we will be facing a huge Fox-generated media storm led by Palin et al.
