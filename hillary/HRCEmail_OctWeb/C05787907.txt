I was at a large reception the other night and wanted to share a few conversations.

                                                                                              gave me a big New
Year's kiss and he gushed thanking me for putting him up in the front row for the speech. Now he's a moderate
guy, but he really surprised me with his high praise for the speech. He underscored how important the issue
is. Interestingly he really put                on the defensive, given how bad their record is. His defense was
pretty pathetic, but I don't think they will actively oppose anything that happens on the issue.

Then I saw the Chancellor of Geneva who was talking to the Mayor of Geneva and the head of the Geneva
press association. She too thanked me for the front row seat and was full of praise for the importance of the
speech and the approach, where the Secretary made it so personal. She challenged the journalist to do a
report on how Geneva is living up to protecting LGBT rights.

One month out, it's wonderful that it is still having an impact.

Happy New Year,
