Subject: Indonesia ratifies global ban on nuclear tests (AP)

JAKARTA, Indonesia - (AP) Indonesia says it has ratified a global treaty banning nuclear test explosions.
   Negotiated in the 1990s, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty specified that the 44 countries with
nuclear power or research reactors at the time needed to give formal approval before it could take effect.
   With the endorsement Tuesday by Indonesia's parliament, the treaty is now only awaiting ratification from
the United States, China, Egypt, India, Iran, Israel, North Korea and Pakistan.
   Indonesian lawmaker Mahfudz Siddiq urged the remaining countries _ especially the U.S. and Israel _ to get
off the bench and sign.
   Indonesia, a nation of 240 million, has three research atomic reactors.
