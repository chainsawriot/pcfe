Cheryl:

Here is the latest update on Michel Kazatchkine's (MK) situation:

1. Simon Bland (SB) and Dr Mphus (GF Board Chair and Co-Chair) continued placing calls to Board members




2. MK called Simon last night to request a one-on-one meeting today at 4pm in Geneva. SB will call or email me with a
readout.

3. Simon, John Monahan and I had dinner last night with Mireille Guigaz, the new French AIDS Am bassador (and new
GF Board member), who drove in from Lyon to meet with them. (The French fired Patrice as AIDS Ambassador and GF
Board member)                                                                                                   B1
                                                                                                                   1.4(B)
a. Guigaz had been in dialogue with MK and French FM all day. We had 2+ hour dialogue over dinner.
                                                                                                                   1.4(D)

So, final chapter about to close. Thank you and the SeCretary for all the support and insights.


As I said in Rwanda memo, heading to SF today for some meetings with Gilead Pharma on 2nd line drug for kids and
Christmas Holiday. Will look forward to talk to you during the week.
