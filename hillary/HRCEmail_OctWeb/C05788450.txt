You had asked about the Quilliam foundation. Here is some basic background:.

The Quilliam Foundation is a London-based think tank that tries to nuance government approaches to Muslims and to
separate Islam and Islamism, which it sees as a root cause of terror. Quilliam seeks to encourage a Western version of
Islam, on the premise that there are more Muslims living in the Western world than the Middle East.

So far they have many focused on publications, reports, and media hits. Critics point out that while certain
organizations, like Active Change, have positively engaged British Muslim communities, Quilliam has focused more on
media efforts that spotlight the problem of extremism rather than actually countering it. They were, apparently, quite
favored by the Labour Government of Gordon Brown, but have fallen out of favor, despite high hopes, with the
Conservative Government.

Two of Quilliam's three founders, Maajid Nawaz and Rashad Zaman Ali, were at one point members of Hizb ut-Tahrir, a
long-standing pan-Islamic organization seeking to re-establish the Caliphate (but not a designated terrorist
organization). Ed Hussein, its third founded, is currently a senior fellow at CFR. Prominent members of the British
political and academic communities sit on the organizations advisory board.
