            Dear Secretary Clinton,

            On March 28th, the Simon Wiesenthal Center and its Museum of Tolerance
            will present its 2011 Humanitarian Award to one of the giants of American
            industry, Jeffrey R. Immelt, Chairman and CEO of the General Electric
            Company, at our National Tribute Dinner at the Mandarin Hotel, New York.

            The Chairmen of the dinner are Nelson Peltz, CEO and Founding Partner,
            Trian Fund Management, L.P., and Beth Comstock, Senior Vice President
            and Chief Marketing Officer, General Electric Company. Some of the Vice-
            Chairmen in formation include Brian Moynihan, President and CEO of Bank of
            America, Peter Grauer, Chairman and President of Bloomberg, L.P., Ed
            Snider, Chairman of Comcast Spectacor, and Michael Kowalski, Chairman
            and CEO of Tiffany.

            On behalf of the Board of Trustees of the Center, we would like to invite you
            to deliver the keynote address at the dinner honoring Jeffrey for his significant
            achievements not only in the world of business but in the world of
            philanthropy. As President Obama said when he appointed him Chairman of
            his Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, "Jeff is somebody who brings a
            wealth of experience to the table. He is one of the nation's most respected
            and admired business leaders...."

            The Center is one of the largest Jewish human rights organizations in the
            United States with a constituency of 400,000 members and we were
            particularly fortunate to have two sitting Presidents: President Ronald Reagan
            and President George H. Bush speak at our dinners, as well as Vice-
            President Al Gore, King Hussein, Senator Ted Kennedy, the Dalai Lama,
            Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
            among other very distinguished world leaders. Most importantly, we were
            fortunate to have your husband, President William Jefferson Clinton, speak at
            our Spirit of Hope Dinner in Toronto in 2006.

            The mission of the Center and the Museum is to combat hatred and
            antisemitism, preserve the memory of the Holocaust, and promote tolerance
            through its world-renowned Museum of Tolerance, which has hosted 5 million
            visitors since its opening in 1993. The Museum conducts the largest diversity
            training program in the United States; its Tools for Tolerance program has

            We would be particularly honored and privileged if you would be able to be
            with us to deliver the principal address and help honor Jeff.

            Sincerely,
