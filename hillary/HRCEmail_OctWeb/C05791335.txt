Subject: Mandela admitted to hospital in South Africa (Reuters)

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Former South African president Nelson Mandela was admitted to hospital on
Saturday for treatment for a "long-standing abdominal complaint", the government said.

   A statement said the 93-year-old anti-apartheid leader needed specialist medical treatment. It wished him a
speedy recovery, but provided no further details.

   Mandela, who is known to be in frail health, spent several days at Johannesburg's Milpark hospital just over
a year ago with respiratory problems.

    Since then he has not appeared in public, and has spent his time between Johannesburg and his ancestral
village of Qunu in South Africa's impoverished Eastern Cape.
