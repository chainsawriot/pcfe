Thanks HRC. Amb Jeffrey is great and trusted by Turks; would be great if this is possible. Perhaps they'd agree to

Phil and Tom-- Amb Jeffrey is not in any WH mtg which I think is a mistake since we rely on him on a daily basis to
reinforce and deliver messages. Would you pis try to include him at least in the Oval mtg? The lunch would obviously be
useful too.
