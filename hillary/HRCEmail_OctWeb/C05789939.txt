Subject: Egypt bars American woman from leaving the country (AP)


CAIRO (AP) - Security officials in Cairo say an American woman facing criminal charges as part of Egypt's
crackdown on foreign-funded pro-democracy organizations has been barred from boarding an international
flight.
   Officials say that Mary Elizabeth Whitehead was trying to board a flight to Germany on Thursday minutes
before take off, when Egyptian airport officials stopped her.
   The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with police regulations.
   Egypt's attorney general has barred seven Americans from travel, including the son of U.S. Transportation
Secretary Ray LaHood. They are among 19 Americans facing trial on charges that include the illegal use of
foreign funds.
   The allegations have caused the deepest crisis in Washington's relations with Cairo in decades.
