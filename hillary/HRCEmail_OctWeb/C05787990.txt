Yes. We need two more examples of this (to add to Shia law in Afghanistan and the forced marriage case in Saudi and
one of the Azeri bloggers) and we'll have a serious record.

This is a note from Yusuf Juma , whose case the Secretary raised in December with Karimov, and who was finally
released Friday and allowed to come to the US.                                                             He told our      B6
embassy staffer who flew back with him that as soon as the Secretary raised his case in December his treatment by
prison guards improved immediately.

Can you pass this on to her with our thanks.

Mike.

To all the anonymous people who made this happen.



From Yusuf Juma
May 23, 2011

"From the very bottom of my heart, I would to thank all individuals that were involved in my release. I know there are a
lot of people who were involved in pushing and advocating for my release and I am looking forward to meeting all of
them, but right now I would like to thank two people: Lorne Craner of IRI for not forgetting about me and constantly
reminding his colleagues about my case, and Madam Secretary Hillary Clinton. I believe it was her personal involvement
in my case that ensured my release. I am very touched that despite difficult geopolitical realities of Central Asia, Madam
Secretary found time to bring up my case during her meeting with [President] Karimov. There is a third actor that I
would to thank, too. It is the people of the United States of America. If it wasn't for the people of this great country,
there wouldn't be individuals like Lorne Craner and Hillary Clinton, which would mean that people like me would be
most likely to perish in dungeons of tyrants and dictators of this world. Only people as great as Americans could build a
country that sees freedoms of other people and nations as important as their own. The U.S. saved me from death two
times: in 2001, when I was arrested for criticizing the Uzbek government and now, when I was so close to death that I
gave up all hope of seeing my family every again.
                                                 and it is all thanks to Madam Secretary, Lorne, the staff of the US Embassy
in Uzbekistan and everyone else who worked on my case. I deeply appreciate everybody's efforts to have me released
from prison and I am looking forward to meeting you all in the nearest future. "
