Subject: Fwd: Special Documentary on President Clinton Tomorrow 10pm

I'm   sure you know about this but w the full schpiell below.




         In a documentary airing tomorrow at 10:00 PM EST on MSNBC, Chris Matthews calls President Clinton a
         one-man Peace Corps.

         Though I know he's far too humble to ever say that himself, President Clinton's work the past 10 years
         has been remarkable.

         From his life-changing work with the Clinton Foundation and his disaster relief efforts for the Indian Ocean
         Tsunami, Hurricane Katrina and the Haiti earthquake, to his humanitarian actions to free two journalists
         from North Korea and the convening power of the Clinton Global Initiative that brings together
         businesses, governments, nonprofits, and individuals to implement real solutions to the world's most
         urgent challenges -- his work today is directly improving hundreds of millions of lives. It is not a stretch to
         say what he has accomplished with friends and supporters like you is truly changing the world.

         And I know this is just the beginning of what we can do.

         This President's Day, there will be a special documentary -- The President of the World: The Bill
         Clinton Phenomenon, Monday, 10:00 PM EST on MSNBC
         <http://whatcounts.comit?r=1925=2499986=56657=3541516:COD97B57DCF68E4CFC5E233FC1C79
         406A60E1DDBDO1ECB9D> , about the 10 years since President Clinton left office. At the Clinton
         Foundation, we are celebrating his last 10 years as a private citizen with a Decade of Difference
         <http://whatcounts.com/t?r=1925=2499986=56657=3541515:COD97B57DCF68E4CFC5E233FC1C79
         406A60E1DDBDO1ECB9D> . I hope you will join us and see the role you have played in President
         Clinton's work during the last 10 years.

         When: 10:00 PM EST, Monday, February 21, 2011
         Where: MSNBC, Hardball with Chris Matthews
         What: President of the World: The Bill Clinton Phenomenon
