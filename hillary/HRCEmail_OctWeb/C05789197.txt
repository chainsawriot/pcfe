Subject: Memo for Secretary Clinton on Iran

Hi Huma

(With my move last year to the National Defense University, I have misplaced your email address, so hope this works).

Attached is a memo I have written for the Secretary on Iran. It is long; but I wanted to be comprehensive and thorough
-- as well as candid and bold -- in a situation that is as full of risks for the United States and our interests as any I have
seen for many years.

Please let me know if you get this.

Given the sensitivity of some of the points, I would value its not circulating beyond Hillary, yourself, and those whom the
Secretary may designate to see it.

Thank you, as always, for your help.

All the best,
Robert
