As we discussed yesterday, following up on a meeting I had at your request with Tom Glocer, CEO of
Thomson Reuters last December, Reuters has now agreed to co-host a global media conference in
London in the Fall. The idea would be to invite a group of about 50 to 100 industry leaders from
around the world to discuss critical issues facing media enterprises in a rapidly evolving marketplace.

I have attached an initial draft agenda for the event. Thomson Reuters will handle all arrangements
and cover all costs. They will work with us to accommodate your schedule and level of participation,
e.g. speech; roundtable; etc.

Let me know what you think.
