        Chuck. I'm forwarding the list of our four most important meetings and talking points for Sec. Clinton. I
        know this is a really difficult weekend for her, given events at the UN, so will understand if she is not
        able to help.

        I have copied my foreign policy staffperson Chad Kreikemeier on this email should anyone need to reach
        him and, of course, I am available by email or cell

        I really appreciate all your help. Safe flight! Jeanne
