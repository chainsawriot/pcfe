And now President Moreno is recognizing all your effort and leadership, saying something like... "and Cheryl... who
always keeps us running... at her own speed".
Great!

The Ambassador is speaking (in perfect creole!), and I got myself a picture with President Clinton.
Very good second bests... as I would have loved to listen to your speech and then get a picture together.
But this is going perfect, everyone is so happy, and you should feel happy and proud.
Hope to meet you soon,
AGUSTIN
