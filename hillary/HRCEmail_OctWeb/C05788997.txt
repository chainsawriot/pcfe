Cheryl,

From the bottom of my heart, please accept the expression of my deepest gratitude for your support to Haiti. Our Good
God has a plan of love and excellence for Haiti that will land in His time and according to His will. I look forward to the
many opportunities to serve that He has planned for me.

Blessings and much love to you and yours,

Daniel
