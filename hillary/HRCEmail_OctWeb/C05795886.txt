Madam Secretary,
Just had call with Helga, Geoffrey Adams, Hans-Dieter Lucas and Jacques Audibert. We agreed to the following for
Helga's call tomorrow with Bagheri (time not yet determined):
- Helga will say we expect to meet in Istanbul in the first instance.
- As appropriate that we are willing to agree to a second round and will consider all venues, including Baghdad. We
would be prepared to announce second round at end of first if all goes well.
- Helga will deploy Geneva as fall back if get stuck on Istanbul vice Baghdad.
- If Bagheri says (not likely) will OK Istanbul if can also announce Baghdad as second round venue, Helga will repeat
would consider all venues but would need to consult P5+1 further.
- Helga will talk again with Sergey Ryabkov bilaterally who is being helpful and who believes much internal dissension in
Tehran both on venue and as proxy for whether talks should be happening.
- If Helga needs to consult before I land in Washington, Kamala and Chris are briefing Bob Einhorn to be unmuted person
on conference call.

I will keep you posted as I fly Dhaka to Dubai to London to Washington! Happy Easter weekend.
Best,
Wendy
