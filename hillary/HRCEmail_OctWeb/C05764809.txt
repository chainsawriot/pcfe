Subject: New Update on Somalia - request for meeting

Dear All:

We met at OFAC today (State, OFAC, USAID), and I believe




I hope we can meet as early as possible on Monday to discuss the documents. As I indicated yesterday, we
will not go to the NSC until we have spoken with you.

Jim Michel would be eager to join any meeting on Monday.

Thanks, and best,

Eric
