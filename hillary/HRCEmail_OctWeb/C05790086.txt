> Dear Huma,

> Felicia Wong gave me your address. I write to request some help, on behalf of the Roosevelt Institute whose board of
directors I chair.

> We have asked Secretary Clinton to receive the FDR Distinguished Public Service Award at our Washington DC dinner
at the end of July ( or any time she is available ). While I know that Mrs. Clinton has received "Roosevelt" awards before,
that is exactly the point. She is continuing to serve, to play big roles in making our nation's history, in such a remarkable
way that we feel it is totally appropriate to recognize the continuing chapters of her service.

> I am particularly asking on behalf of our youth movement, called the Roosevelt Institute Campus Network - 12,000
students on over 110 campuses across the country. They are a prominent part of this event, and they hold Mrs. Clinton
in such high esteem.

> We would be so honored if she would accept this award. Can you help persuade her?

> With much appreciation,

> Anna Eleanor Roosevelt
