Subject: FW: Senator McConnell's NPT remarks to the press

Measured (but supportive) comments from McConnell. Unsure how much of a window on sanctions he's given,
but this should help start a more robust conversation on the Hill about relaxation of some sanctions.



SENATOR MCCONNELL:

So as somebody who has watched events in this country for some 20 years, I must say this is the first time that Ii have
been genuinely optimistic about the future. I'm convinced as Igo back to Washington and review these matters with my
colleagues that reform is clearly on the agenda here and likely to stay on the agenda.

As some of you may know, I was the author of most of the sanctions legislation that's been passed in Washington over
the last years. My view of that is similar to what Secretary Clinton has already said publicly, which is that what we're
looking for is reciprocity. As the country moves forward down the path of reform, then we.will review the sanctions. As
you know, we've already responded to the events to date by the announcement by Secretary Clinton that the
Administration is going to recommend an ambassador, which we will consider under our Constitution in the U.S.
Senate. So that's an indication of our pleasure at what has happened so far. And I hope we will be to the position in the
not-too-distant future that I and others can be recommending lifting the sanctions. So it's going to be step-by-step. As
we see further steps down the road toward reform, we'll consider lifting sanctions.
