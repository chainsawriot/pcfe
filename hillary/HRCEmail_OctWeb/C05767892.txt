Subject: Mexico: official visit

Arturo, Jake: I did not want the Secretary blindsided if/when she sees Mexican Foreign Secretary Espinosa in Costa
Ricaâ€”the White House has offered May 19th to the Mexican government for an official visit by Calderon to Washington
(official visit w/state dinner). THIS IS EXCEEDINGLY CLOSE HOLD; Mexicans have not yet responded formally, but we
believe they will accept. Thanks, Roberta
