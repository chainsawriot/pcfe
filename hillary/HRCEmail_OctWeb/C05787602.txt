I love Sabra hummus--whatever that means!

In the Chicago SunTimes today.

DePaul University students, consider carefully before you vote to ban Sabra brand hummus from
your campus.
According to the Jewish United Fund/Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Chicago, a referendum
asking students whether they want a replacement hummus brand served on campus is in fact part of
an effort to eliminate Israel.
"As trivial as the determination of which kind of hummus to serve to students at a local university
may seem, this campaign has serious ramifications," said Michael C. Kotzin, the Jewish
Federation's executive vice president. "SJP is using misleading language to cloak their real
intention in the guise of concern for human rights. In fact, their ultimate goal is the elimination of
the State of Israel."
The SJP -- Students for Justice in Palestine â€” are behind the referendum, and they say Sabra's
parent company, the Strauss group, sends financial support to two Israeli military units accused of
human rights abuses
