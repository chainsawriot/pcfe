Subject: Wounded Libyan fighters recover at Mass. hospital (AP)

SALEM, Mass. - (AP) Nearly two dozen Libyan rebel fighters flown to the U.S. after being severely
wounded in their country's civil war are recovering at a Boston-area rehabilitation hospital.
   Several of the men spoke to reporters Thursday at Spaulding Hospital North Shore. They thanked their
doctors and U.S. officials who helped arrange the treatment, which is paid for by Libya's transitional
government.
   The wounded fighters range in age from 16 to 49. Doctors say they're suffering from various forms of
trauma, including gunshot and shrapnel wounds and head and spinal cord injuries.
   Osama Ali El Amin says he was shot during a Tripoli protest against longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi. The
bullet fractured his arm and remains lodged in his chest.
   Doctors say several of the men could be in the hospital for months.
