I kind of heard that u were setting up or thinking about a foreign policy advisory council -- can't remember exactly. If you
are--- pick ten of those people get on a conference call with them on Mondayand ask them to find ways they can validate
the points you made in the speech (they can validate it by putting it in their blogs, or newsletters or in up coming
speeches.) -- especially pushing the "Participation Age" -- which should become a living legacy phrase for you -- got to
get the phrase branded as your quickly. m
