AMMAN (Reuters) - President Bashar al-Assad's forces killed 103 people in Syria on February 24 in the
bombardment of the city of Horns and in attacks on the countryside of llama and the east and north of the
country, the activist group Local Coordination Committees said.

    Most of those killed were civilians, including 14 children and one woman, it said.

  Anas al-Tarsheh, an activist in Horns who has been filming the bombardment and uploading the footage on
YouTube, was also killed by the shelling, the grassroots opposition activists' organisation said in statement.
