Thanks jose
Cheryl is right, she won't have much if any independant stops on her schedule while she's in china with the president but
if that changes, will get in touch.

Got it - not sure where she will go as she is likely to travel mostly with the president but we will put Expo under
consideration and looping in Huma.

Hi Cheryl - if Secy Clinton does something related to Expo in Shanghai in Nov during APEC, assuming she goes, I'd really
like to try to meet her there. Incidentally, If she goes to Shanghai, it would be viewed as odd for her not to visit the Expo
site, given the personal interest she has taken in the matter. xo - jose
