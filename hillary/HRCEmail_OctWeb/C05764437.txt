SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED

Legislative Affairs

      •    Jack said his meeting with Senate and House Appropriations staff yesterday went well, but was fairly non-
           specific. (In contrast, he noted, to when he used to deal with the Republican majority during the Clinton
           Administration when the discussion of numbers was very specific.) The staff seemed receptive to the idea of
           increasing flexibility and reducing earmarks, but noted in turn the need for the Administration to be more
           flexible in its requests. In their view, everything should be on the table, not just the items Congress wants to
           earmark.

      *    Jack also reported that there are problems with the 2010 bill — the staff believe it cannot be taken to the Senate
           floor as a standalone bill because it would be a magnet for amendments (on GTMO, Mexico City language,
           etc.). They are looking for an omnibus vehicle.

      •    Rich said H is working with EUR on a memo to S on Armenia spelling out our position on a new Armenian
           Genocide Resolution, how we should approach the Diaspora, and which prominent Armenian-Americans the
           Secretary should contact.

      O    Rich also noted that there would likely be two more food security briefings — one each for House and Senate.

      O    Finally, we have received two additional requests for GTMO briefings —from Berman and Hoyer.

    •    Eric Boswell noted that there were two bombings at the Islamic University in Pakistan today, one involving a
         female suicide bomber at the women's campus which killed at least six, and the other involving an attack at the
         men's campus. All USG personnel have been accounted for.

Public Affairs

    •    Pi noted that the Sudan rollout had gone well and press has been good. He said that Gration was doing some
         additional follow-up briefings today.

    •    Ellen Tauscher will do a briefing at 11:00 today on non-proliferation to set the stage for the Secretary's speech
         tomorrow.

    •    PA is moving forward with setting up a briefing on the civilian side of our efforts in Afghanistan.

Roman Polanski

    •    Harold noted that Polanski's appeal has been denied and he is now in jail in Switzerland. L anticipates an
         extradition request by Thanksgiving.

Deputies Meeting Highlights

Public Diplomacy and Pakistan

    •    Judith McHale raised a number of issues in the aftermath of a very successful global PAO conference last
         week. She noted, in particular, the appointment of Larry Schwartz as "uber PAO" in Pakistan to coordinate all of
         our public diplomacy efforts and oversee a $100 million plus overall budget.




    •    Not just in Pakistan, Judith noted, we face a demographic challenge when it comes to young people. Many are
         not that familiar with the U.S. and are not necessarily that well disposed tq the U.S. as had been the case with
         previous generations.

European Affairs

    •    Phil Gordon expressed concern about the need to consult more closely with NATO allies before a final decision is
         made on Afghanistan/Pakistan strategy and troop levels. He noted that we don't want a replay of Missile
         Defense.

S/SRAP

    •    S/SRAP noted that Karzai has just agreed to accept the IEC results and agreed to a run-off election that would be
         held November 7. Senator Kerry has been very helpful in this process.




USUN

    •    Erica said that Ambassador Rice is in Israel today and that there is an unhelpful story in the Israeli press
         purporting to lay out U.S. strategy on the Goldstone report as told by a foreign mission in New York.

   •     Iran has asked for a Security Council Resolution condemning the bombing in S.E. Iran over the weekend. This
         should not be a problem.

Honduras

   •     Tom Shannon said that the talks made no progress yesterday. We have, however, revoked six more visas from
         prominent Micheletti supporters and need to see what impact that may have.

South Central Asia

    •    Bob Blake reported that a court in Kazakhstan had upheld the conviction of a prominent human rights activist on
         vehicular manslaughter charges despite "many irregularities" in the proceedings.
