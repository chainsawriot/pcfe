Subject: UPDATE: UN Elections Head Into Extra Rounds (AP)


UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Pakistan, Morocco, Guatemala, and Togo were elected to two-year UN Security
Council terms October 21, but the final decision on a fifth seat was postponed until next week.


UN General Assembly President Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser said voting will continue October 24 after a ninth
round of voting found neither of the two countries vying for the Eastern European seat able to secure the two-
thirds majority needed to join the United Nations' most powerful body.


The last tally had 113 votes for Azerbaijan and 77 for Slovenia. Hungary, which also had been a candidate for
the sole Eastern European slot, was knocked out of the running in an earlier round.
