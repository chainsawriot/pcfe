                                     Madeleine Albright's Prague Winter

                                                                         ALBRIGHT

Madeleine Albright covered a lot of territory in her decades as a diplomat, and she's done so again more recently as a
best-selling author. From her classic memoir, Madame Secretary(Miramax, $14.95), to her witty and artful Read My
Pins(HarperCollins, $40), to her examination of the role of religion in world affairs in The Mighty and the
Almighty (Perennial, $14.95), to her Memo to the President Elect (Perennial, $14.95), her books have been bold,
candid, and elegantly written.
Given this literary track record, we eagerly awaited her newest title, Prague Winter: A Personal Story of Remembrance
and War, 1937-1948 (HarperCollins, $29.99).And what a book it has turned out to be.
Prague Winter is part family history, part political and cultural history, and part lesson on the moral dilemmas and choices
people and nations face in the tumultuous context of war. It is also a page-turner. Reading the manuscript before he died,
Albright's friend and hero, former Czech President Vaclav Havel, called it "a remarkable story of adventure and passion,
tragedy and courage, set against the backdrop of occupied Czechoslovakia and World War II."
The impetus to write Prague Winter, as Albright explains in the opening pages, was her desire to delve more deeply into
her family's past, most notably her discovery at age 59 that three of her grandparents and many other family members
had died in the Holocaust. The information, uncovered by aWashington Post reporter shortly after Albright became U.S.
secretary of state in 1997, was stunning. She had been raised by her Czech parents as a Roman Catholic.
In the years following the discovery of her family's Jewish roots, she began her own journey, taking trips to the Czech
Republic to renew acquaintances with a cousin she had known as a child, mining her father's voluminous papers, and
retrieving newly released documents related to her father's career as a diplomat, democratic reformer, and head of
wartime broadcasting for the Czechoslovak government in exile. Along the way, she realized that her family's complicated
past could only be fully understood in the context of Czech history and the upheaval generated by World War II.
Indeed, the tales of Albright's family and of her native land are intertwined. Czechoslovakia was a small strategically
located country used as a bargaining chip by the major European powers, resulting in the appeasement of Hitler and the
onset of global conflict. In less than a dozen years, hundreds of thousands of Czech citizens, including Albright's parents,
were uprooted, thrust into new roles, and forced to grapple with questions of identity, belief, and survival in a climate of
fear and mistrust.
Albright captures the heroism, resilience, and sadness of that period, as well as the characters and events that defined it,
with a historian's eye, a writer's touch, and a humanist's heart. Even those already knowledgeable about the era will learn
something new and meaningful in every chapter.
