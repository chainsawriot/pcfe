Catherine Browr                                     This email is from her husband Robert, who is the Executive
Associate Director at OMB, essentially number 3 at OMB, which I'm sure you know, but just in case.

Hope you're very well and hope you get at least a brief break soon from carrying the world on your shoulders.

Neera
