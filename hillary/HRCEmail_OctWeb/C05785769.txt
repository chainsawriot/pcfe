Subject: Pakistan PM alleges conspiracy to oust government (AP)

ISLAMABAD - (AP) Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani says there is a conspiracy to oust the
country's civilian government.
   His comments Thursday reflect growing tension between the government and Pakistan's powerful army over
a memo scandal that forced Islamabad's ambassador to the U.S. to resign and is even threatening the president.
   The secret memo was sent to Washington in May asking for help in averting a supposed coup by the
Pakistani army in the wake of the American raid that killed Osama bin Laden.
   Gilani's statement is a sharp turn, just days after he rejected the notion of a standoff between the army and the
civilian leadership over the scandal.
   The Supreme Court has initiated a hearing into the memo and has demanded a reply from President Asif Ali
Zardari.
