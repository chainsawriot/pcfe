Donna, we in Consular Affairs are working this very closely with our Embassy in Port au Prince and with appropriate
Department of Homeland Security authorities. I think there is agreement on the 47 because there is a U.S. connection in
the form of a potential adoptive parent or possibly a home in another country (we understand some of these children
have been identified for adoption by families in Canada and other countries). We don't have any information on the
status of the remaining 14. There are concerns that we don't know for certain that they or orphans or in general know
who they are or what the status is in Haiti. We think it's best to move ahead with those we can document now and
to hold off on those that may need further investigation. Please know that this has been discussed thoroughly between
the State Department and USCIS and ICE at the Department of Homeland Security.


Please let me know if you have any further questions. We're ready to help with the 47 any way that we can.

Regards,



Janice L Jacobs
Assistant Secretary
Bureau of Consular Affairs

Permit me to share the latest information I received from the Governor.

It is his understanding that the green light has been obtained from the Haitians and the U.S. to more 47 of the children to
the U.S. There are 14 however in limbo. T

he Haitian courts have granted these 14 "humanitarian parole" but because the adoptive homes for these 14 children are
not yet certain the U.S. authorities are not willing to let these children come to the U.S.

The Governor and our humanitarian agencies in Pennsylvania have committed to finding the homes for these children.

While we recognize and understand the policy of not typically releasing children without firm home plans, all the children
are enroute to the embassy right now with the full expectations that they were cleared to come. Is there a way to ensure
that the 14 children without adoptive parents can be released — we understand that Nida Buckic (sp?) and Whitney Rietiz
(sp?) at State and Huma have a copy of the Haitian court order permitting the release of these children. So our
understanding the hold up for these 14 children is on the U.S. side.

We are most appreciative of your effort to assist us.

        Cheryl, Governor Rendell just landed in Miami and checked in. He suggested that if the problem is on the Haitian
        side, perhaps the person at State who is assisting with clearing the way for this children on our behalf could reach
        out to the Haitian Ambassador to the U.S. Raymond Joseph -- The Ambassador has been intimately involved in
        helping us get clearance to bring these children to the U.S. His number in D.C. is

        We are happy to call him but we don't have the information your folks have with respect to what approvals may be
        missing from the Haitian authorities. If you would like us to reach out to the Ambassador and have him call you or
        someone else at State we are happy to do so.

        We are most appreciative of your willingness to assist us, we know your hands are very very full right now.

                 The issue is NOT U.S., contrary to what has been represented. We require some approvals from Haitian
                 govt - am working to try to secure.

              thank you - a contact at state who could help resolve the consular general issue would be very
              very helpful.

                      Importance: High

                      If you have a moment we have a bit of a urgent matter -- you may know we are
                      attempting to bring about sixty children from Haiti -- they are orphans (per dating the
                      earthquake) that resided in an orphanage managed by two women from Pittsburgh who
                      are affiliated with the Catholic church.

                      The military has been very helpful and the plane to pick up the children will be landing in
                      Haiti at 5:40 -- the Governor is on that plane because he was told the Haitian officials
                      would not release the children (due to the short notice) without the Governor taking
                      personal responsibility for their well being.

                      He began this effort by communicating with the state department to ensure their
                      cooperation and in spite of them being very overwhelmed, they have been extremely
                      helpful to our efforts to move this children to safety in the U.S.

                      However, we just learned via the military that the counsel general in the embassy is not
                      willing to process the paperwork for all the children who have home plans in the U.S. We
                      don't know the exact reasons why. We are attempting to reach Huma at State since
                      she's been involved but we cannot reach her. Our question is whether you have
                      someway to help us reach Huma or anyone else who could help us resolve this matter
                      with the counsel general so the children can be released.

                       I can be reached at
