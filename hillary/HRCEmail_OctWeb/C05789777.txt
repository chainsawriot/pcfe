Subject:                           Books on Burma



Philippe is looking for a list of books that you read for your Burma trip for the Steve Myers story, which has a lot on
Burma.

We found two in your office. Can we share these with Philippe? Are there any other books you'd like us to add? He's fine
with one book but will take as many as he can get.



1.    Burma/Myanmar: What Everyone Needs to Know, by David Steinberg, 2010.

2.    The Lady and the Peacock: The Life of Aung San Suu Kyi, by Peter Popham, 2011.
