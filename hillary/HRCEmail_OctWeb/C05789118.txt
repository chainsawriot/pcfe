CAIRO (Reuters) - Tunisia will host a meeting of the "Friends of Syria" which will group nations seeking to
build an international agreement on how to end violence in Syria, Arab ministers said on Sunday.

   "I welcome Tunisia's invitation for this international conference on Feb. 24. I think it will be a good
opportunity to try to create a clear international direction to help the Syrian people to exit the crisis. We will
work for this meeting to succeed," Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani told Arab ministers
meeting in Cairo.

   Tunisian Foreign Minister Rafik Ben Adessalam said the "Friends of Syria" meeting would include Arab,
regional and other international states.
