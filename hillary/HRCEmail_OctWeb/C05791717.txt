Dear Melanne,

We are very pleased to have you back this year for CSW.




    As you know, I too am deeply committed to the welfare of the world's women, and we have
worked hard at the Mission to advance all manner of women's issues during this Administration.


     You have now made it a fixture, and all understand the key leadership role you play on behalf of
the US.




I appreciate your understanding and, as alvklys, look forward to our close collaboration.

Best,

Susan
