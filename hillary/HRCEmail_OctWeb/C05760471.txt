I want to do everything on Friday. And I think that's better since FMs will be leaving after mtg. I can do it all in one day.
Also, Miliband wants to do a Quad mtg which I think may be ok since I can see all three at one time.

Also the db can come tomorrow and take the 4pm shuttle home                                                                          B6

Started follow up on everything you sent yesterday.
- Sent WH all relevant call and meeting requests.
- will make a brussels schedule with additional bilats for you to look at. We can either do a very intensive brussels day on
friday and come back. Or do bilats on sat and fly back early. Working on it with EUR. Most people are out today.
- I left a few messages for                  III also ask danny for his plane as soon a I hear back.                                 B6

- I sent oscar a note from david miliband to print for you.
- do you want the pdb today? Or do you want fri and sat to come together tomorrow?
- for sunday, we can book you on a 3 or 4pm shuttle and you can go home or                          What do u want to do?            B6
