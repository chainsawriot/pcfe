Subject: Lawyer says Taiwan official in Mo. to plead guilty (AP)

KANSAS CITY, Mo. - (AP) The lawyer for a Taiwanese representative charged in Kansas City with
violating federal labor laws says his client has agreed to plead guilty.
  Hsien Hsien Liu, director general of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Kansas City, is charged in
federal court with fraud in foreign labor contracting. She's accused of underpaying a housekeeper hired from the
Philippines to work at her home in Johnson County, Kan., keeping her isolated and making her work 16- to 18-
hour days. Liu faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
  Her lawyer, Jim Wirken, said Thursday that Liu will plead guilty to the charge Friday. He said he's seeking to
have Liu sentenced to probation and deported immediately.
  A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office declined comment.
