Hillary:

I note that you are meeting with Foreign Secretary Rao tomorrow. I am on my way back from India, where I had a very
positive meeting with FS Rao and the Indian Election Commission about the prospects for increasing India's role in
elections globally and collaborating more closely in third countries. FS Rao is discussing this proposal with the Election
Commission, which is very interested in greater collaboration with American institutions. Bob Blake and I will be
following up with India's Chief Election Commissioner when he travels to Washington, DC next week.

Best,
Maria
