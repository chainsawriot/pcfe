I spoke w her and she made point that Zuma                                                    and they intend to use variety     B5
of energy sources in the future but this project is essential to deliver electricity—which I think our experts agree is right.
Also she said their Finance Ministry would respond to Treasury but didn't have details.

I will talk to Don Gips this afternoon. From the traffic, I get the sense that DCM Helen La Lime has been frenetically
engaged with the South African MFA.

For now, Hormats and Lew are negotiating with Treasury. It may be that over the weekend or Monday you need to
make two calls -- one to Geithner and one to Lowey. But that moment hasn't arrived yet.
