Subject: How To Pray for Egypt by Ramez Attalah

Dear friends, The Internet has just started again so I am taking the opportunity to make some quick comments incase we
get ofline again.

You know the political situation from excellent media coverage, so I won't comment on that.

1. Christians and Muslims have been united as never before defending their homes on overnight shifts (due to the lack
off police security) this is resulting for many to make friends with neighbors they never knew and there is a real sense of
camaraderie which we never had before.

2. Most of the demonstrations in Cairo are restricted to Tahrir square which is very close to Kasr El Doubara Evangelical
Church, so they especially need your prayers for protection.

3. No one we know has been injured or attacked.

4. Food, medical and other supplies are dwindling since most factories and businesses are closed after last weeks wave
of vandalism and the daily 3 pm curfew. Pray for the poor and destitute who suffer most at this time.

5. I've lived through many of these kind of dramatic events (1952 revolution which deposed the King, the burning of
much of downtown Cairo, the tri-partite attack on Egypt in 1956 by the Israelis, French and British following the
nationalization of the Suez canal (a bomb fell in our garden), the nationalization of all capitalists when my family lost all
their properties and were terribly humiliated, my pediatrician was tortured to death in jail during that time, the brutal
assassination in 1981 of President Sadat after he made peace with Israel, the security forces rampage which caused
much damage around the city and a strong earthquake in 1992 etc.. So though this situation is volatile and unstable
we've lived through similar crises and its not time to panic or leave the country.

6. All Bible Society staff and properties are safe up till now.

7. Please pray for:

a. Christians in Egypt (locals and expats) to not get tempted to "run" when things get hard. Libby Little whose husband
Tom was brutally murdered in Afghanistan last summer said that during that terrible war they and their daughters were
called "the people who stayed"! Lucien Accad, the former head of the Bible Society of Lebanon stayed with his family
during that dangerous civil war even though they all had Swiss passports and could leave....

b. For The Bible Society of Egypt to think of creative ways to bring God's Word to the people in appropriate ways during
these difficult times (much of Scripture was written in contexts of danger) staff are working from their homes of print
and audio materials to produce as soon as we get back to the office.

c. For wisdom for the Army to know how to control the situation without resorting to brutal means to control the
crowds.

d. For me to quickly recuperate from a heart crisis (arrhythmia) which I succumbed to last Wednesday and spend 8 days
in CCU. Today is my first day home.

THANKS FOR YOUR PRAYERS, THAT'S WHAT WE MOST NEED!
