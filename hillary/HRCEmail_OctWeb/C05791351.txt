Subject: Mediator: Senegal proposal rejected by both sides (AP)

DAKAR, Senegal - (AP) A former president of Nigeria has proposed that Senegal's leader stay in office for
two more years, but his plan aimed at helping Senegal emerge from a political standoff has not been accepted
by either the president or the opposition.
  The opposition is calling for 85-year-old President Abdoulaye Wade to resign and say they will render the
country ungovernable if he wins Sunday's election. Former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo met with
both sides in an effort to mediate a solution.
  He said that Wade has already said that if he were to win Sunday's poll, he would step down after three years
and not serve the full seven-year term. Meanwhile, he said opposition leaders want him to stay for no more than
one year _ and so he tried to offer a middle ground.
