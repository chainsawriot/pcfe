           communications.

           believe it will call for any change in DHS role in the visa process.


     •     Bill Burns has a closed hearing on Iran in front of HFAC on Thursday.

LEGAL ISSUES

     •     Issue of KSD trial venue still up in the air. Justice hinting they would welcome help from the Secretary.

ASSISTANT SECRETARIES MEETING — HIGHLIGHTS

WHA

     •     Colombian Constitutional Court ruling against a third term for Uribe; good news for democracy.

10

     •     IAEA Board of Governors meeting opens in Vienna today.

     •     Human Rights Council session opens in Geneva today; Maria Otero is there for the beginning.


     •     Goldstone Report resolution passed the General Assembly on Friday —vote was 98 in favor, 7 against (including
           us) and 31 abstentions.

     •      Gabon takes over presidency of SY Council this month.




     •      Long-delayed export initiative may be rolled out this week.

     •      At a meeting of the National Advisory Council on funding for international development banks, main issue of
            contention was the Inter-American Development Bank whose management has come under criticism for lack of
            reforms and poor investment decisions. They will likely receive a funding increase, but not as much as
            requested.
