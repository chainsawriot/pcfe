Subject: Arab League head says Syrian army outside cities (Reuters)

CAIRO (Reuters) - Syria's military has withdrawn from residential areas and is on the outskirts of the country's
cities, but gunfire continues and snipers are still a threat, the Arab League's Secretary General Nabil Elaraby
said January 2.

   The United Nations says more than 5000 people have been killed in a crackdown on protests which broke
out against President Bashar al-Assad in March.

   Elaraby was speaking in Cairo as Arab League monitors gathered in Syria to check compliance with a peace
plan. He said the League would report on the work of the monitors over the first week and decide if more were
needed there.
