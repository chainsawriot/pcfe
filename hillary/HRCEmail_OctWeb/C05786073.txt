Sounds good. I suspect you will have regular PCs on Tuesday at 5:15pm and 4:30pm on Wednesday but there were no
topics set as of yesterday for either one. Other than those two potential PCs, you have the usual senior staffand A/S
meetings but that is all, we kept them completely flexible and open for full days of office time.
