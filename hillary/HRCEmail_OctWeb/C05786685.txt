I had asked my team to follow up on the Specter letter that came up in today's staff meeting. Peter worked with 10 on
it, and developed the below...

I meant to send this to you last week and it slipped off my radar.

Jake--

Christopher and I wanted to follow-up with you on this. The Specter Letter somewhat misunderstood the purpose of the
UN's Mediation Support Unit (MSU). The MSU provides technical experts who can give support UN mediators, not the
mediators themselves. Essentially, the MSU has on-call outside experts (academics, think tanks, etc.) in things like
constitutional drafting, revenue sharing mechanisms, etc., so that when a UN mediator needs technical expertise to
finish brokering a deal between two parties, he has someone/someones to turn to.

In the UN system, mediation itself is generally done by a Secretary-General appointed Special Representative, Special
Envoy, or other individual (eg, al-Khatib); it is that individual who calls on the MSU when needed. These Representatives
are the kinds of individuals with the statute and title clout to actually broker deals




Best,

Peter

Jakeâ€”

Absolutely. I'm going to work on this with Christopher Le Mon, Esther's Senior Adviser, who has also recently been doing
other work on U.N.
appointment issues and also thinking about how to get more out of the UN Department of Political Affairs, which we
currently under-use.

Peter - Specter sent S a letter on something called the Mediation Support Unit at the UN (apparently it's in their public
affairs shop).
He proposes using it in Syria. Leaving aside Syria, S is (1) interested in whether we can breathe real life into it and what
that would look like. She is also (2) interested in building a roster of highly skilled American mediators, like Ken
Feinberg, who could be seconded to the unit to work on things like Cyprus.

Can you do some digging on (1) and some thinking on good candidates for (2)?
