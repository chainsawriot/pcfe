CSO is going well – big challenges ahead. Thanks again!! This is completely self-promotion: the Irish guy who organized
the first 1,000 days event with us now works for WFP and is hearing about the impact of 1,000 Days on the ground (see
below). Go S! Go us!

Hi Cindy!

How are you? I hope all is well.

I have just returned from a series of field trips to the DRC, South Sudan, Rwanda, Kenya and Burundi - busy developing
strategies for our new Cash and Voucher approaches.

You will be pleased to hear that in very many of the countries people I met spoke to me about the important need to
address the first 1,000 days of life. I was very pleasantly surprised to hear reference to 1,000 days in some of the most
peripheral areas and most difficult humanitarian environments. The countries were I visited had such high levels of
accurate malnutrition, and I hope that they can really make progress in addressing the issue.

I remembered the summer of 2010 and I thought to myself that I must write to you and let you know that there is definite
impact on the ground.

You mentioned the new arrival here. Yes, I am very excited to see the new direction—WFP is a very exciting organisation
with so much promise. I hope we will see you in Rome one of these days too!

All the best,

Simon
