Subject:                          Question



Did you hear any feedback from the Shapiro ceremony?

I had to run out to catch the shuttle which sat on the tarmac for 2hours before returning to the gate so I am now driving
to NY! If I had known I would have stayed to kibitz myself.

What else do you know? If you have time, call me thru ops.
