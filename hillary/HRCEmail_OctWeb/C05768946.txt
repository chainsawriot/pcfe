Yes -- around 5 tomorrow evening. We're working on prebrief time. Derek was huge in this process, but Bob deserves a

I agree with you ... The document is really strong.

Am I going to                to discuss draft?

Derek's draft is very good. I have a few questions I'd like to raise w him and Jim on Monday.
