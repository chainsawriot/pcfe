See below.

With upcoming COM conference, are there ambos you definitely want to see?

My inclination for the rest is to ask them for notes on matters unless significant.

Dear Alan

Thanks for this update - sounds like things are busy for you.

Let me work w/ Lona as the COM week also is week of a UK state visit and revert as to what makes sense.

I am sure S would also welcome a note on these matters as well.

Best
Cdm

Subject: Request for a meeting with the Secretary

Cheryl,

I am looking forward to attending the Chiefs of Mission Conference and I'm writing to request a short meeting
with the Secretary.

Spain has recently elected a new government, and there are some pending issues that concern me, and I believe
the Secretary, which I'd like to discuss with her. These include:

      •    A White House meeting between President Obama and President Rajoy
      •    Palomares cleanup

   •   USTR 301 watch list
   •   GOS interest in economic statecraft

I know the Secretary has met the new Foreign Minister, Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, and I'd like the
opportunity to share my own impressions of the new government. I've been invited to a working lunch later
this week with Spain's Vice-President and Ministers of Defense, Interior and Foreign Affairs, to discuss the
whole range of bilateral issues between us. My meeting with the Secretary, following that meeting, will be
especially timely.

I would also like to brief the Secretary on a major conference the Embassy will host in Madrid at the end of
March on volunteerism and service. Assistant Secretary Stock and Special Representative Balderston have both
agreed to attend along with a number of service leaders from the U.S. Because of the Secretary's passion for
this subject and the emphasis she has give to it, I thought she'd be interested in learning of our plans.

I know the Secretary's time is precious, and I can address all of these matters in a short meeting. Obviously,
I'm available any time throughout the week of the conference if this meeting can be scheduled.
Finally, I had a very productive audience with the King recently, and he asked me specifically to extend his
warm regards to the Secretary. Please let her know.

Many thanks, Cheryl.

Alan
