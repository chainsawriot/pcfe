Jason Segel Wants to Star in a Movie With Hillary
Clinton!
Entertainment March 12, 2012 AT 11:37AM By Zach Johnson




His previous leading ladies have included A-list beauties like Mila Kunis, Emily Blunt, Kristen Bell and Amy
Adams, but there's one woman Jason Segel is dying to share the screen with: Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton!

 "I just feel like she would be good at comedy," the actor, 32, told Us Weekly at the Jeff Who Lives at Home
 premiere in L.A. Wednesday. "I think you can feel it from a mile away."

(Indeed, Clinton poked fun of herself on Saturday Night Live in 2008.)

 Segel has already imagined a title for his project with thepolitician, 64: "Sarah Marshall 2: This Time It's
 Personal."

All kidding aside, Segel told Us his favorite onscreen partner thus far has been Blunt, 29, who plays his fiancee
in The Five-Year Engagement.

"Emily and I have been friends for a long time, so I think my favorite part of the movie are the in-between
scenes where you can tell it wasn't two random viable actors who are matched up for a romantic comedy," Segel
said. "It looks like people who have known each other for a long time, and I think that's what makes the
difference."
