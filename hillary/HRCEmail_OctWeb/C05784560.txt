Subject: New Libyan government sworn in (AP)

TRIPOLI, Libya - (AP) Libya's transitional government has been sworn in before the country's interim
leader, another step along to the oil-rich country's roadmap to elections next year.
   The new government read the oath of office before its leader, Abdel-Jalil Mustafa, on Thursday. The lineup
of relative unknowns will confront daunting challenges, like establishing control over the fractured nation after
the ousting of Moammar Gadhafi's 42-year regime.
   Prime Minister Abdurrahim el-Keib said the government's first task is to formulate plans to build state
institutions. Gadhafi left few institutions behind, preferring one-man rule.
   The formation of the Cabinet clears the way for the next key step on the timeline _ election of a 200-member
national congress by the end of June.
