Akiva Orr: Juliano Mer Khamis was killed for "Alice in
Wonderland"
On 04.06.11, By Max




Juliano Mer Khamis with the cast of Alice in Wonderland, his final production at Jenin Freedom Theater
After the killing of Juliano Mer Khamis, I asked my friend Akiva Orr (watch my interview with him here) to write something
about the actor. As an activist and writer since the early 1950's, Akiva got to know Juliano and his mother, Arna. Akiva
attended Juliano's funeral yesterday in Kibbutz Ramot Menashe, then wrote me the following:
Sad news
Yesterday the Israeli-Arab actor-director Juliano Mer-Khamis was shot dead by a hooded assassin near his Freedom
Theatre in Jenin.
Juliano Mer-Khamis's funeral took place today in Kibbutz Ramot Menashe some 10 feet from his mother's grave (which
he designed).
  knew his mother very well.
Arne (1930-1995) was a genuine humanist who could not remain quiet when she saw someone being wronged
It outraged her and she reacted vehemently.
It was a guts response, not a rational response.
Jules took after her but had the added complication that his Dad was a christian Arab (once the leader of the CP in
Nazareth) whereas Arna was a secular Jew whose father founded the medical corps in the IDF was a world authority on
Malaria, hated Ben-Gurion, and expelled her after marrying an Arab.
Jules had a cultural ID complex which he exploited through art. He was an excellent actor. He acted out his life.
About 800 people attended the funeral, two third Arabs one third Jews.
I met many old friends there.

Nowadays we are too old to meet in demos so we meet in funerals.
An Arab youth choir sang and many people said a few words.
Udi Adiv (who did 12 years in prison for trying [unsuccessfully] to set up a Jewish-Arab Israeli armed struggle group
against Israel in 1971) told me he was in constant contact with Jules.
Jules complained about the the arch conservative leadership of the Jenin refugee camp and planned to move to Jenin
town, which is more enlightened.
The older generation leadership (50% of the camp inmates are under 20) was worried that the youth followed Juliano and
his "Freedom Theater".
He preached freedom not only from Israel, but also from Muslim tradition.
Many young girls, who rebel against the subservient role of women in the Palestinian society, were ardent actresses.
The oldies didn't like the fact that girls appear on stage, have roles, and act together with boys.
The theatre is located inside the camp.
There were two attempts, to burn it down.
The latest play Jules staged was "Alice in wonderland"
Most theatres in the West Bank refused to show it because the major role of a clever girl outraged all oldies in the West
Bank.
No newspaper in the West Bank mentioned the Alice play.
It seems this was too much for the oldies.
So Jules paid with his life for staging "Alice in wonderland" in Palestine.
He died for the cause of "women's liberation" ... which goes much beyond "Palestine liberation."
Too much for some people.
MAY ALICE FORGIVE THE FOLLIES OF THE FOOLS
