I spoke at the opening - it is an amazing facility in the most private of settings. There were so many
photos of you and President Clinton there so many years ago. I think the facility could be quite
extraordinary for hosting a bilateral in a different place and then stay on for a day to enjoy the
privacy! Your video was a HUGE hit!
