SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED

1206/1207

    •   Jack suggested that the Secretary may have to call Secretary Gates to discuss our proposal for a pilot 1206
        program, adding that he (Jack) is at the limit of his comfort in pressing this given concern over PM capacity. (The
        pilot would be between $50-100 million.) DoD folks seem concerned that the pilot would undercut their
        ar ument in favor of the British model.



Congressional Issues

    •   Rich said he had misspoken yesterday and that the proposed export promotion breakfast briefing with the
        Secretary and Secretary Gates is January 27.

Legal Affairs

    •   Harold said that A/S Posner is in Israel and reports that the Israelis are considering the composition of their
        Commission of Inquiry in response to the Goldstone Report. They will also make the case to the UN that at no
        time did they deliberately target civilians.




Public Affairs

    •   PA is working to amplify the Secretary's speech in Hawaii today as well as her bilateral meeting with the
        Japanese FM.

    •   PJ noted the likely fallout from the UAE court decision acquitting a member of the royal family in the notorious
        torture case and convicting two Americans in absentia for allegedly drugging the UAE royal family member and
        attempting to blackmail him with the videotape.
