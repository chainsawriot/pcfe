THE TOP 3 CONTENDERS to succeed Secretary of State Clinton, who has said she would step down if
President Obama were reelected: Sen. John Kerry ... national security adviser Tom Donilon ... Susan Rice,
U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta.

--Both Clinton and Panetta have their eyes on a little R&R But given their portfolios, they're not going to
split on Jan. 20. There are too many variables, including the confirmation process, and military and diplomatic
markers and timelines. So we could imagine the President asking each of them to stay on through, say, spring
for succession/transition.

--Foreign Policy's "Turtle Bay" blog, "Has Susan Rice found her cojones moment?" by Colum Lynch : "
On Monday, Susan Rice, speaking to hundreds of rabbis at a luncheon hosted by the America Israel Public
Affairs Committee (AIPAC), ... demonstrated a shared understanding with America's pro-Israel community,
which often feels isolated at the United Nations. ... Rice's speech had the feeling an election rally and an
audition, an opportunity to demonstrate to Israel's backers that the Obama administration -- and she personally -
- share their emotional bond to the Jewish homeland. ... The remarks were broadcast and re-tweeted around the
globe, and caught the attention of an important constituency in Washington -- political conservatives who have
never formed part of her base." http://bitly/wLylpk

--Sen. John Kerry op-ed in WashPost, "Romney's interference on Iran": "Romney's goal remains winning
the acquiescence of his party's base ... It is deja vu. While wise Republicans stress the perils of loose war talk
and the value of engagement to isolate Iran, Romney seeks to create political division with an attack on the
Obama administration's Iran policy that is as inaccurate as it is aggressive. ... Romney should take on the man in
the White House instead of inventing straw men on op-ed pages." http://wapo.st/Ayebh
