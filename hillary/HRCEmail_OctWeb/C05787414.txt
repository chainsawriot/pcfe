  Dear Hillary,

  Very happy you liked it. Of course let Bill read it.

 Working on several chapters with special focus right now on Ch. 8, which is about peace group's trip in late summer '93,
 when they met with everyone, including Ulster paramilitaries in the basement of a secret location. Bruce was the
 spokesman, performed brilliantly on a levels and established the group as knowledgable and as honest brokers. That trip
 laid the best foundation for the new American policy. The chapter you read and this one will I hope be a good presentation
 for agents and publishers. Also trying to place a modified version of Ch. 1 in a good magazine for next March; thinking
 that this--something great that actually got accomplished--would be good to read about during the campaign, which I fear
 will not feature the most eleveted salvos from the Republicans on foreign policy. Plus it should help make the book a more
 attractive proposition.



                                                                             The link follows the colon: here it is



  Looking forward to DVD. It might be helpful to you to see the little outline we offered Case so here it is:

  In terms of content, here are five elements the people at the Child Study Center hope it will contain:

 1. Regrets that she can not be with us at this event celebrating the first 100 years of the Yale Child Study Center and
 paying tribute to Dr. Solnit;

 2. Context of her work with Dr. Solnit;

 3. Some memories of working with him and others at the Child Study Center--Sally Provence, for example;

 4. At YCSC she and her mentors were in a world of focus on--and learning from--individual children and their
 families. Now she is literally in a world of entire populations (consisting, of course, of individual children and their
 families.) How do these connect for her? How does what she got from Al and others touch--or come to mind in--her world
 now?

  5. Best wishes for the next hundred years of the Yale Child Study Center.

 Apart from this very general outline, all of us feel strongly that the less written out and the more off the top, the
 better. She's completely among friends here and we are happy to see what comes out as she searches for a thought or a
 memory. Many of us have had direct conversation with her at one time or another and would love it if the DVD had that
 feel. We know that her work with children is near her heart and that she has plenty to say about it. What are few
 conversational fits and starts among friends?

Dear Penn,

Sorry to be so tardy, but it was not for any reason other than I hadn't yet had time to read your chapter
and wanted to do so before responding. I have now and think it's terrific: well-written and making the
reader want to know more about Bruce and Northern Ireland. How far along are you?

With your permission, I'd love to give it to Bill to read. He remains devoted to all things Irish.




I will certainly ad lib about Al and Sally and the Center--w so many memories and emotions, I will
probably have to be cut off.

All the best on all fronts--H

Hi Hillary,

Know your plate is full, full, full but assuming you got my last email and Morrison materials. Without wanting
to impose, I must confess to concern that Morrison chapter and outline maybe didn't do much for you and that it
leaves you in an uncomfortable position. If that's the case, please feel free to say so; I don't want that to get in
the way of our communication. If it's simply a case other demands on your time, please disregard this--better
yet, pretend I never sent it-- and get back to me in your time.

Tomorrow we will see a short film at the New York Film Festival




Re Solnit dvd, I am pitching to Case Button that the less written out, the more off the top, the better. You will
be, as always, totally among friends and we are looking forward to whatever stories re Al/Sally/CSC etc you
might think of and how that experience/those folks can come to mind and bear on the job you are doing now.
We gave him a brief outline that might be helpful. In any event, we're really looking forward to your video visit

Penn
