MANILA (AP) - The Philippines says it did not take part in a UN vote on a resolution calling on Syrian leader
Bashar Asad to step down as it seeks Syria's help in moving Filipinos from the troubled nation.
   The UN General Assembly voted overwhelmingly for a resolution backing an Arab League plan calling on
Assad to step down and strongly condemning human rights violations by his regime, which has been blamed for
a bloody crackdown that has killed over 5400 people.
   Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario said the Philippines' main concern was to repatriate thousands of
Filipinos in Syria through the help of its government.
   Nearly 1000 Filipino workers have fled from Syria and thousands more remain there.
