Subject: Iran intelligence chief rejects US allegations (AP)

TEHRAN, Iran - (AP) Iran's intelligence chief says there are holes in the U.S. allegations that Iranian agents
plotted to kill the Saudi ambassador to the United States.
  Heidar Moslehi says no professional intelligence agency would issue orders to an agent in a foreign country
over the phone, nor would it transfer money to drug cartels through a New York bank.
  He says Iran doesn't need to resort to such terror plots and Tehran would not benefit from killing a Saudi
diplomat.
   His remarks were posted on state TV's website Thursday.
   Two men, including an alleged member of Iran's special foreign actions unit known as the Quds Force, have
been charged in New York federal court with conspiring to kill the Saudi ambassador.
   Iran has dismissed the claims as "absurd and meaningless."
