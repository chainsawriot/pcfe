The Foreign Ministers of the United States, France, and Russia, the High Representative for the Common Foreign and
Security Policy of the European Union, and the Foreign Minister of Slovenia on behalf of the Council of Europe,
commend the governments of Armenia and Turkey on their signing of the historic protocols on normalization of
relations on October 10, 2010, in Zurich, Switzerland. They applaud this visionary and courageous agreement by the
leaders of both countries to move forward toward full normalization of relations. They commit to doing everything they
can to support the prompt ratification and implementation of the protocols. They also express appreciation for the
assistance of the Swiss in facilitating discussions between the parties.
