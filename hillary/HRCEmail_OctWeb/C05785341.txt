Subject: Re Libya

Spoke again to the key guy of G. G won't speak at present since he thinks I've "betrayed " him by calling for him to go.
But I feel that's a tactic. Truth is I fear they're dug in. The one thing they would accept is what they call a fact finding
mission by whoever. le everything would halt for that. I said but G would have to stand aside. He balked at that. But I
feel that it might be possible to achieve that. However I don't want to go back unless there's still an appetite for a
peaceful solution if one can be found of him standing down.
I think G would speak if there was a way of doing this without his humiliation. Up to you and ready to talk if you wish.
