LAGOS (AP) - An official with the Nigerian Red Cross says the death toll from a series of attacks carried out
by a radical Muslim sect in northeast Nigeria has risen to more than 100.
  Red Cross official Ibrahim Bulama told The Associated Press on Sunday that he expects the number to rise as
local clinics and hospitals tabulate their numbers in Damauturu, the capital of Yobe state.
   A radical Muslim sect known locally as Boko Haram claimed responsibility for the attacks Friday, which
included suicide bombings and shootings in the cities of Damaturu and Maiduguri. Nearly all the deaths
occurred in and around Damaturu.
