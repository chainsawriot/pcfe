Yes it was a book on burma folk tales and they gave you a little Burmese charm. Also some DVDs (and they tried to give
you an iPad with other downloaded movies!). We have the titles which I can send around.

Do you remember the story of how those books were delivered in the middle of the night by 2 FSOs (married) on our
way back from Indonesia?

Philippe is looking for a list of books that you read for your Burma trip for the Steve Myers story, which has a lot on
Burma.

We found two in your office. Can we share these with Philippe? Are there any other books you'd like us to add? He's fine
with one book but will take as many as he can get.



1.    Burma/Myanmar: What Everyone Needs to Know, by David Steinberg, 2010.

2.    The Lady and the Peacock: The Life of Aung San Suu Kyi, by Peter Popham, 2011.
