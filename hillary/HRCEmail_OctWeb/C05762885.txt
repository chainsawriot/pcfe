Secretary Clinton: I look forward to meeting with Jackie and will get her on my schedule soonest.

By the way, I just testified before the HASC on Pakistan and there was much rumbling about moving the Pakistan
Counterinsurgency Capabilities Fund from Titile 10 to Titile 22.
                                                                                                                     It
would be incredibly helpful if you would be willing to convey this position to Rep Lowey before this gets too far down
the road.

Thanks so much! And good luck on the Hill tomorrow.

Michele
