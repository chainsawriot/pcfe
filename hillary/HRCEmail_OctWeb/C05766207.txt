Dear Cheryl -- You may be aware that Reps. Frank Wolf, Chris Smith and Donald Payne are holding a press
conference today to denounce the Obama policy, or lack thereof, on Darfur. Jim chose not participate, although
he will be sending a letter of concern later this week. He asked that I pass a message (below) from him. Best --
Cindy

You should let hillary's people know that we will not participate in wolfs press conference--though we are
concerned. We love hillary and believe when she unveils global food security plan we will have somethiing
concrete and meaningful to praise. It will represent a real and positive step forward on human rights. Jim
