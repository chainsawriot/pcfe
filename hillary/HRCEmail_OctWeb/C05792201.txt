Subject: Bangladesh slams Clinton over Grameen comments (AP)

DHAKA (AP) - A Cabinet official says recent comments by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton
that she hopes Bangladesh's government will not interfere in internationally acclaimed microlender Grameen
Bank were unwarranted.
Finance Minister A.M.A. Muhith said Tuesday the government has never meddled in the bank and denied
claims by its founder, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, that the administration is trying to take it
over.
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's administration has long had frosty relations with 71-year-old Yunus and ousted
him as managing director of the bank last year in a dispute over retirement age.
