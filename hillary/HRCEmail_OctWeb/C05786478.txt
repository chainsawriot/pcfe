Susie Buell has contributed 200k toward the APEC summit in SF. She's thrilled it's in SF and that you're keynoting. She
wants it to be wonderful for you (as we all do). I will go out in a few weeks and plan with her, but wanted you to know.

I'm leaving for Zambia today. The African Women Entrepreneurs Program that you kicked off last year is blossoming
hugely and the First Lady of Zambia has become very engaged with the businesswomen in her country. It's all very
encouraging.
