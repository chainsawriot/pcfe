I forward this to you as I think I have discussed my concern that the overall narrative of "strengthen USAID" may not play
credibly to an external audience. This is just a blog entry but I expect more of this in coming weeks and would appreciate
the chance to rethink our strategy for communicating our approach (and also in some cases pushing the policy envelope a
little harder so we have a strong case to make).

Thx
Raj

Like many U.S. policy watchers, I have been reserving judgment on the administration's development
policy while they staffed up and worked through the PSD and QDDR. The rhetoric and the overall budqet
have so far been positive signs that development issues will get more attention and the key agencies
more of a role in the interagency process.

But, at sixteen months and counting, I have a nagging question that I suspect I share with many others:
Since when does "elevating development" mean further eroding USAID's leadership, status, and
mandates? Despite all the promises, the much ballyhooed "3D" strategy so far seems to be




   o Decapitate. It took nearly a full year to finally appoint a USAID administrator. The eventual pick,
     Raj Shah, seems sharp and highly capable, but an extra four months later, he is still 0 for 12 on
     filling senior management positions. Yes, the vetting process is brutal and dysfunctional, but is any
     other federal agency still this empty at the top?
   • Demote. The USAID administrator still technically holds the rank of deputy secretary, but the
     position has been downgraded. Unlike his predecessor, Shah's post is no longer dual-hatted as
     "director of foreign assistance" (so called F) within State. The lines of authority also seem less
     direct. Although I'm told Shah reports directly to the Secretary, the new second deputy secretary
     (filled by Jack Lew) is an extra layer between USAID and the State Department's 7th floor that
     didn't exist before.
   • Deny budget authority. The previous F/USAID dual-hatting arrangement was far from perfect,
     but gave USAID tremendous de facto influence and authority over the budget. By splitting those
     two roles, USAID is now, in both form and practice, almost completely out of the budget game.

       These early signs should be warnings rather than comfort for those who were expecting so much
       more. If USAID continues to be stuck between an ambivalent White House and a turf-assertive
       State Department, it will continue its long decline. If the administration is serious about rebuilding
       USAID into the "premier development agency," is it too much to ask that Shah be given a
       management team, clear and direct authorities, and some formal budget function?
