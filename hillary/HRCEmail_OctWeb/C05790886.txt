23 Social Media Facts to Share with Executives

Written on February 14, 2011 by Espo in social media

[014-11.64J]

For my job, I read and research A LOT and save A LOT of useful stats and figures that help "sell" the benefits of social
media for companies. Not just from a communications perspective, but also from a strategic thinking and integration
point of view. Usually they wind up stuck in my presentations or in my bookmark folders, but aren't shared much
outside of my company's four walls — which is unfortunate.

Social media is a place to share, so here is a breakdown of 23 high-level numbers and statistics that can make jaws drop,
and get the hamsters in their heads turning the wheel. If you are asking why 23, well I was watching the NBA with my
nephew when thinking up this post and figured I would pay homage to Jordan. Feel free to share in presentations as you
like.

are squirreling away stats and figures that could help your fellow social media practitioners.
