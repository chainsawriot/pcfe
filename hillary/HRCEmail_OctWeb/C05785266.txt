If we can get the language changed (e.g. illegal vs illegitimate) and a commitment from the Pals not to pursue similar
resolution, we have a rationale for abstention, including with the Israelis — although they won't like it. In that
connection, it could be decisive with the Pals if the Europeans were to say that they would abstain if this were brought
to the UNSC under current circumstances. We would have to work it hard with relevant folks here and in Israel.




If we are unable to change the language, on balance I would veto. If we abstain on a resolution that is contrary to our
position, after we have suggested we would veto, it will appear that we are acting in reaction to the situation on the
ground. I think that would make us appear weak rather than strong. It is hard to articulate a rationale for abstention
that does not suggest that this is a retreat in response to events. In Israel, that would be seen as the first manifestation
of the "post- Mubarak" order, and reinforce the narrative of abandonment, perhaps contributing to an atmosphere in
Israel that produces unhelpful steps of their own in reaction to the current crisis.

Why will tying it up make it less appealing? And why is Gaza gas highly problematic for the Pals?

Jake,

Here you go.

Note that most of this looks to be repackaged items that either are already underway or that we previously brought to
COGAT and/or others and know are in the works (or that they told have been approved.) Beyond the Gaza gas thing
which will be highly problematic for a # of external and internal reasons, I honestly don't see anything here that will be a
big wow — though there are several ongoing important efforts (most notably the water and construction and export stuff
in Gaza). But those things should be continuing regardless of any special announcement. And tying it up in these kind of
bells and whistles will probably make it less rather than more appealing, unfortunately. (Putting aside the ability to
follow through on Gaza work depending on what happens with Egypt...)

Please let me know if you have questions.

--Mara
