If you have the time/inclination, your voice is probably most likely to break through with Ashton. Notice below the
reference to a regional security working group.

Hi Jake,

We discussed with Bill the benefits of a call to Ashton from the Secretary in advance of the Istanbul meetings (we are in
transit now). I don't know if her schedule allows, given the Lebanon and other calls I know are in the queue. But if
possible to do today, some points below.

Elisa
