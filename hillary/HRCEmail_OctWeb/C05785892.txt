Subject: State attorney: Judges broke law in Berenson case (AP)


(SBU) Embassy Lima comments it has been following these legal maneuvers and currently is hopeful
Berenson's planned December 19 travel back to the U.S. will not be impacted.




(U) LIMA (AP) - Peru's state anti-terrorism attorney says he plans to seek misconduct charges against the three
judges who gave paroled U.S. activist Lori Berenson permission to leave the country for the first time since her
1995 arrest..
   Julio Galindo says he will ask prosecutors Monday to charge the judges with violating anti-terrorism laws by
granting Berenson permission to travel to New York for the holidays with her toddler son.
   Despite the court approval, Berenson was barred from boarding a flight on Friday. Her lawyer says officials
demanded a document that doesn't exist.
   Lawyer Anibal Apari says a meeting is planned with Interior Ministry officials Monday to try to resolve
matters so the pair can travel.
