      Trial Chamber I ("Trial Chamber" or "Chamber") of the International Criminal
      Court ("Court" or "ICC"), in the case of Prosecutor v. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo
      ("Lubanga case"), issues the following Summary of the "Judgment pursuant to

      Article 74 of the Statute":


                 A. Introduction

           1. This is the summary of the Chamber's Judgment under Article 74 of the
               Rome Statute as to whether the Prosecutor has proved the guilt of the
               accused.


                 B. Charges against the accused


            2. On 29 January 2007 the Pre-Trial Chamber issued its Decision on the
               Confirmation of Charges. The Pre-Trial Chamber confirmed that there
               was sufficient evidence to establish substantial grounds to believe that:
                     Thomas Lubanga Dyilo is responsible, as co-perpetrator, for the charges of
                     enlisting and conscripting children under the age of fifteen years into the FPLC
                     and using them to participate actively in hostilities within the meaning of articles
                     8(2)(b)(xxvi) and 25(3)(a) of the Statute from early September 2002 to 2 June 2003.


             Additionally, the Pre-Trial Chamber confirmed that there was sufficient
             evidence to establish substantial grounds to believe that:
                     Thomas Lubanga Dyilo is responsible, as co-perpetrator, for the charges of
                     enlisting and conscripting children under the age of fifteen years into the FPLC
                     and using them to participate actively in hostilities within the meaning of articles
                     8(2)(e)(vii) and 25(3)(a) of the Statute from 2 June to 13 August 2003.



                 C. Jurisdiction

            3. Pursuant to Article 19 of the Statute, the "Court shall satisfy itself that it
               has jurisdiction in any case brought before it." The Democratic Republic

               of the Congo ("DRC") became a State party on 11 April 2002 and,
               pursuant to Article 14 of the Statute, President Kabila referred the
               situation in the DRC to the Prosecutor in March 2004. Pre-Trial Chamber
               I concluded that the case falls within the Court's jurisdiction, and the
               Appeals Chamber confirmed the Pre-Trial Chamber's Decision on the
               accused's challenge to the jurisdiction of the Court. The personal,
               temporal, territorial and subject-matter elements that are relevant to the
               Court's jurisdiction have not altered since the Decision on the
               Confirmation of the Charges, and the issue has not been raised by the
               parties or any State before the Trial Chamber.


                 D. Brief case history

            4. The first status conference before the Trial Chamber was held on 4
               September 2007, and thereafter there were 54 status conferences prior to
               the commencement of the trial. The following is a summary of the main
               procedural events which had a significant impact on the course of the
               proceedings.


            5. The trial was stayed twice as a consequence of disclosure issues. The first
               stay was imposed by the Chamber on 13 June 2008, and it was lifted on
               18 November 2008. A second stay was imposed on 8 July 2010. The
               presentation of evidence resumed on 25 October 2010.


            6. The parties and the legal representatives of victims made their opening
               statements on 26 and 27 January 2009. The prosecution called its first
               witness on 28 January 2009. The prosecution's oral evidence concluded
               on 14 July 2009.

                                                                     ICC-01/04-01/06-2843 14-03-2012 5/17 SL T




            7. On 3 September 2009, the Chamber adjourned the presentation of
               evidence pending an interlocutory appeal. The Appeals Chamber issued
               its judgment on the matter on 8 December 2009 and the evidence
               resumed on 7 January 2010.


           8. The defence presented a bifurcated case. In the first part the defence in
               essence called into question the testimony of all the prosecution's child
               soldier witnesses, a process .that included the presentation of rebuttal
               witnesses by the prosecution. On 10 December 2010, the defence filed an
               application seeking a permanent stay of the proceedings. The Chamber
               issued a Decision dismissing the defence application on 23 February
               2011.


            9. The second part of the defence evidence was introduced thereafter and
               on 20 May 2011 the presentation of evidence formally closed.


           10.The Trial Chamber heard 67 witnesses, and there were 204 days of
               hearings. The prosecution called 36 witnesses, including 3 experts, and
               the defence called 24 witnesses. Three victims were called as witnesses
               following a request from their legal representatives. Additionally, the
               Chamber called four experts. The prosecution submitted 368 items of
               evidence, the defence 992, and the legal representatives 13 (1373 in total).
               In addition to the written submissions, the oral closing arguments of the
               parties and participants were heard on 25 and 26 August 2011. Since 6
               June 2007, when the record of the case was transmitted to the Trial

               Chamber, the Chamber has delivered 275 written decisions and orders
               and 347 oral decisions.


           11.In accordance with Article 68(3) of the Statute, victims have participated
               in the case, and in particular they have applied to introduce evidence,
               they have questioned witnesses and they have advanced written and
               oral submissions with the leave of the Chamber and with the assistance
               of their legal representatives. The total number of individual victims
               authorised to participate in the proceedings is 129 (34 female and 95
               male victims).


           12.At the request of the accused and in accordance with Article 76(2) of the
               Statute, the Chamber in an oral Decision ruled that there would be a
               separate sentencing hearing if the accused is convicted.


                 E. Factual overview

           13.The Trial Chamber heard the testimony of several expert witnesses and it
               reviewed documentary evidence that relates to the existence of an inter-
               ethnic conflict in Ituri between 1999 and 2003.


           14.Against this background, the Union des Patriotes Congolais ("UPC")
               was created on 15 September 2000. Although Thomas Lubanga was one
               of the UPC's founding members and its President from the outset, the
               nature of the group when it was created is a matter of dispute in this
               case. These topics are analysed in greater detail below when the




       No. ICC-01/04-01./06                   6/17                            14 March 2012

               Chamber deals with the individual criminal responsibility of the
               accused.


           15.The UPC and its military wing, the Force Patriotique pour la Liberation du
               Congo ("FPLC"), took power in Ituri in September 2002.


                 F. The Burden and Standard of Proof

           16.Under Article 66 of the Statute, the accused is presumed to be innocent
               until the Prosecutor has proved his guilt. For a conviction, each element
               of the crime charged must be established "beyond reasonable doubt".


                 G. Intermediaries

           17.An issue that occupied the Chamber for a significant part of this trial
               concerned the use by the prosecution of local intermediaries in the DRC.
               The Chamber is of the view that the prosecution should not have
               delegated its investigative responsibilities to the intermediaries as
               analysed in the judgment, notwithstanding the extensive security
               difficulties that it faced. A series of witnesses have been called during
               this trial whose evidence, as a result of the essentially unsupervised
               actions of three of the principal intermediaries, cannot safely be relied
               on.


           18.The Chamber spent a considerable period of time investigating the
               circumstances of a substantial number of individuals whose evidence
               was, at least in part, inaccurate or dishonest. The prosecution's
               negligence in failing to verify and scrutinise this material sufficiently
               before it was introduced led to significant expenditure on the part of the

       No. ICC-01/04-01/06                    7/17                            14 March 2012

                                                                        ICC-01/04-01/06-2843 14-03-2012 8/17 SL T




               Court. An additional consequence of the lack of proper oversight of the
               intermediaries is that they were potentially able to take advantage of the
               witnesses they contacted. Irrespective of the Chamber's conclusions
               regarding the credibility and reliability of the alleged former child
               soldier witnesses, given their youth and likely exposure to conflict, they
               were vulnerable to manipulation.


           19. The Chamber has withdrawn the right of six dual status witnesses to
               participate in the proceedings, as a result of the Chamber's conclusions
               as to the reliability and accuracy of these witnesses.


           20.Likewise, the Chamber has not relied on the testimony of the three
               victims who testified in Court (a/0225/06, a/0229/06, and a/0270/07),
               because their accounts are unreliable. Given the material doubts that
               exist as to the identities of two of these individuals, which inevitably
               affect the evidence of the third, the Chamber decided to withdraw the
               permission originally granted to them to participate as victims.


            21.The Chamber has concluded that there is a risk that intermediaries P-
               0143, P-316 and P-321 persuaded, encouraged, or assisted witnesses to
               give false evidence. These individuals may have committed crimes
               under Article 70 of the Statute. Pursuant to Rule 165 of the Rules, the
               responsibility to initiate and conduct investigations in these
               circumstances lies with the prosecution. Investigations can be initiated
               on the basis of information communicated by a Chamber or any reliable
               source. The Chamber communicates the relevant information to the



       No. ICC-01/04-01/06                     8/17                               14 March 2012

               OTP, and the Prosecutor should ensure that the risk of a conflict of
               interest is avoided for the purposes of any investigation.


                 H. Armed conflict and its nature

           22.Although the Pre-Trial Chamber in its Confirmation of Charges Decision
               determined that for part of the relevant period the conflict was
               international in character, the Chamber concludes that the UPC/FPLC, as
               an organised armed group, was involved in an internal armed conflict
               against the Armee Populaire Congolaise ("APC") and other Lendu
               militias, including the Force de Resistance Patriotique en Ituri ("FRPI"),
               between September 2002 and 13 August 2003. Accordingly, applying
               Regulation 55 of the Regulations of the Court, the Chamber has changed
               the legal characterisation of the facts to the extent that the armed conflict
               relevant to the charges was non-international in character.


                 I. Legal definition of conscription, enlistment and use

            23. The charges against the accused include three distinct criminal acts. The
               Chamber has concluded that the crimes of conscription and enlistment
               are committed at the moment a child under the age of 15 is enrolled into
               or joins an armed force or group, with or without compulsion. These
               offences are continuous in nature. They end only when the child reaches
               15 years of age or leaves the force or group.


            24. As regards the offence of using children under the age of 15 to
               participate actively in hostilities, the Chamber has concluded that this
               includes a wide range of activities, from those children on the front line

                                                                     ICC-01/04-01/06-2843 14-03-2012 10/17 SL T




               (who participate directly) through to the boys or girls who are involved
               in a myriad of roles that support the combatants. All of these activities,
               which cover either direct or indirect participation, have an underlying
               common feature: the child concerned is, at the very least, a potential
               target. The decisive factor, therefore, in deciding if an "indirect" role is
               to be treated as active participation in hostilities is whether the support
               provided by the child to the combatants exposed him or her to real
               danger as a potential target. In the judgment of the Chamber these
               combined factors — the child's support and this level of consequential
               risk — mean that although absent from the immediate scene of the
               hostilities, the individual was nonetheless actively involved in them.


                 J. The facts relating to the conscription and enlistment of children
                     under the age of 15 and using them to participate actively in the
                     hostilities

           25. It is alleged that the accused, jointly with others, conscripted and
               enlisted children under the age of 15 years into the armed group of the
               UPC/FPLC and that he used them to participate actively in hostilities
               between 1 September 2002 and 13 August 2003.


            26.The Chamber has concluded that the UPC/FPLC was an armed group.


            27. The Chamber finds that between 1 September 2002 and 13 August 2003,
               the armed wing of the UPC/FPLC was responsible for the widespread
               recruitment of young people, including children under the age of 15, on
               an enforced as well as a "voluntary" basis.

                                                                    ICC-01/04-01/06-2843 14-03-2012 11/17 SL T




           28. Multiple witnesses testified credibly and reliably that children under 15
               were "voluntarily" or forcibly recruited into the UPC/FPLC and sent to
               either the headquarters of the UPC/FPLC in Bunia or its military training
               camps, including at Rwampara, Mandro, and Mongbwalu. Video
               evidence clearly shows recruits under the age of 15 in the Rwampara
               camp.


           29. The evidence demonstrates that children in the military camps endured
               harsh training regimes and were subjected to a variety of severe
               punishments. The evidence also establishes that children, mainly girls,
               were used by UPC/FPLC commanders to carry out domestic work. The
               Trial Chamber heard evidence from witnesses that girl soldiers were
               subjected to sexual violence and rape. Witnesses specifically referred to
               girls under the age of 15 who were subjected to sexual violence by
               UPC/FPLC commanders. Sexual violence does not form part of the
               charges against the accused, and the Chamber has not made any
               findings of fact on the issue, particularly as to whether responsibility is
               to be attributed to the accused.


            30. The evidence has established beyond reasonable doubt that children
               under the age of 15 were conscripted and enlisted into the UPC/FPLC
               forces between 1 September 2002 and 13 August 2003.


            31. The testimony of multiple witnesses and the documentary evidence
               have demonstrated that children under the age of 15 were within the
               ranks of the UPC/FPLC between 1 September 2002 and 13 August 2003.
               The evidence proves that children were deployed as soldiers in Bunia,

               Tchomia, Kasenyi, Bogoro and elsewhere, and they took part in fighting,
               including at Kobu, Songolo and Mongbwalu. It has been established that
               the UPC/FPLC used children under the age of 15 as military guards. The
               evidence reveals that a special "Kadogo Unit" was formed, which was
               comprised principally of children under the age of 15. The evidence of
               various witnesses, as well as video footage, demonstrates that
               commanders in the UPC/FPLC frequently used children under the age
               of 15 as bodyguards. The accounts of several witnesses, along with the
               video evidence, clearly prove that children under the age of 15 acted as
               bodyguards or served within the presidential guard of Mr Lubanga.


            32. In all the circumstances, the evidence has established beyond reasonable
               doubt that children under the age of 15 were used by the UPC/FPLC to
               participate actively in hostilities between 1 September 2002 and 13
               August 2003.


                 K. Legal analysis of Articles 25(3)(a) and 30 of the Statute

            33.The Chamber has concluded that pursuant to Articles 25(3)(a) and 30 of
               the Statute, the prosecution must prove in relation to each charge that:
                    (i) there was an agreement or common plan between the accused
                    and at least one other co-perpetrator that, once implemented, will
                    result in the commission of the relevant crime in the ordinary
                    course of events;
                    (ii) the accused provided an essential contribution to the common
                    plan that resulted in the commission of the relevant crime;
                    (iii) the accused meant to conscript, enlist or use children under the
                    age of 15 to participate actively in hostilities or he was aware that

                    by implementing the common plan these consequences "will occur
                    in the ordinary course of events";
                    (iv) the accused was aware that he provided an essential
                    contribution to the implementation of the common plan; and
                    (v) the accused was aware of the factual circumstances that
                    established the existence of an armed conflict and the link between
                    these circumstances and his conduct.


                 L. The facts relating to the individual criminal responsibility of Mr
                    Thomas Lubanga

            34. The evidence has confirmed that the accused and his co-perpetrators
               agreed to, and participated in, a common plan to build an army for the
               purpose of establishing and maintaining political and military control
               over Ituri. In the ordinary course of events, this resulted in the
               conscription and enlistment of boys and girls under the age of 15, and
               their use to participate actively in hostilities.


            35. The Chamber has concluded that from late 2000 onwards Thomas
               Lubanga acted with his co-perpetrators, who included Floribert
               Kisembo, Bosco Ntaganda, Chief Kahwa, and commanders Tchaligonza,
               Bagonza and Kasangaki. Mr Lubanga's involvement with the soldiers
               (including young children) who were sent to Uganda for training is of
               significance. Although these events fall outside the period covered by
               the charges and are outwith the temporal jurisdiction of the Court, they
               provide evidence on the activities of this group, and they help establish
               the existence of the common plan before and throughout the period of
               the charges.

           36. The accused was in conflict with Mr Mbusa Nyamwisi and the
               Rassemblement Congolais pour la Democratie - Mouvement de Liberation

               ("RCD-ML") from at least April 2002, and he led a group that sought to
               bring about political change in Ituri, including the removal of Mr Mbusa
               Nyamwisi by force, if necessary. The accused remained in control, by
               delegated authority, whilst he was detained during the summer of 2002
               and he sent Chief Kahwa and Mr Beiza to Rwanda to obtain arms.
               During that period, Floribert Kisembo, Bosco Ntaganda and Chief
               Kahwa, three of the accused's principal alleged co-perpetrators, were
               generally responsible for recruitment and training, which included girls
               and boys under the age of 15.


           37. The accused and at least some of his co-perpetrators were involved in
               the takeover of Bunia in August 2002. Thomas Lubanga, as the highest
               authority within the UPC/FPLC, appointed Chief Kahwa, Floribert
               Kisembo and Bosco Ntaganda to senior positions within the UPC/FPLC.
               The evidence has established that during this period, the leaders of the
               UPC/FPLC, including Chief Kahwa, and Bosco Ntaganda, and Hema
               elders such as Eloy Mafuta, were active in mobilisation drives and
               recruitment campaigns in order to persuade Hema families to send their
               children to join the UPC/FPLC. Those children recruited before the
               formal creation of the FPLC were incorporated into that group and a
               number of military training camps were added to the original facility at
               Mandro. The Chamber has concluded that between 1 September 2002
               and 13 August 2003, a significant number of high-ranking members of
               the UPC/FPLC and other personnel conducted a large-scale recruitment

               exercise directed at young people, including children under the age of
               15, on both voluntary and coercive bases.


            38. The Chamber is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that as a result of the
               implementation of the common plan to build an army for the purpose of
               establishing and maintaining political and military control over Ituri,
               boys and girls under the age of 15 were conscripted and enlisted into the
               UPC/FPLC between 1 September 2002 and 13 August 2003. Similarly, the
               Chamber is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the UPC/FPLC used
               children under the age of 15 to participate actively in hostilities
               including during battles. They were used, during the relevant period, as
               soldiers and as bodyguards for senior officials including the accused.


            39. Thomas Lubanga was the President of the UPC/FPLC, and the evidence
               demonstrates that he was simultaneously the Commander-in-Chief of
               the army and its political leader. He exercised an overall coordinating
               role as regards the activities of the UPC/FPLC. He was informed, on a
               substantive and continuous basis, of the operations of the FPLC. He was
               involved in the planning of military operations, and he played a critical
               role in providing logistical support, including providing weapons,
               ammunition, food, uniforms, military rations and other general supplies
               to the FPLC troops. He was closely involved in making decisions on
               recruitment policy and he actively supported recruitment initiatives, for
               instance by giving speeches to the local population and the recruits. In
               his speech at the Rwampara military camp, he encouraged children
               including those under the age of 15 years, to join the army and to
               provide security for the populace once deployed in the field after their

               military training. Furthermore, he personally used children below the
               age of 15 amongst his bodyguards and he regularly saw guards of other
               UPC/FPLC staff members who were below the age of 15. The Chamber
               has concluded that these contributions by Thomas Lubanga, taken
               together, were essential to a common plan that resulted in the
               conscription and enlistment of girls and boys below the age of 15 into
               the UPC/FPLC and their use to actively participate in hostilities.


           40. The Chamber is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, as set out above, that
               Thomas Lubanga acted with the intent and knowledge necessary to
               establish the charges (the mental element required by Article 30). He
               was aware of the factual circumstances that established the existence of
               the armed conflict. Furthermore, he was aware of the nexus between the
               said circumstances and his own conduct, which resulted in the
               conscription, enlistment and use of children below the age of 15 to
               participate actively in hostilities.



                 M. Conclusion of the Chamber

            41. Although Judges Odio Benito and Fulford have written separate and
               dissenting opinions on particular discrete issues, the Chamber has
               reached its decision unanimously.


            42. The Chamber concludes that the prosecution has proved beyond
               reasonable doubt that Mr Thomas Lubanga Dyilo is guilty of the crimes
               of conscripting and enlisting children under the age of fifteen years into
               the FPLC and using them to participate actively in hostilities within the
