They just said the 5 may go at 6;45 but we know they don't yet have a plane to switch to.

Kerry just called to say that the pilot is reviewing the paperwork so hopefully you will be boarding soon. If not, we will
have the 6pm ready.

Isn't US air going to get a replacement aircraft for the 5?

I can only book yours -- I just spoke to Kerry Crowe who thought it would be too tight to make the 5:30pm at this point.

There don't appear to be any direct flights left tonight. I just
booked you on the 5:30pm Delta as back up.
