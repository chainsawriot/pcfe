Subject: MESSAGE FROM FRENCH ON SYRIA FOR S

French called and asked us to pass on the following message to the US delegation heading to Paris for Syria meeting this
evening:

--France believes UN Monitoring Mission needs to deploy immediately.

--We cannot bear the responsibility for interrupting the Annan process.

--The Syrian opposition wants the monitors.

--France cannot see strategically were we could go if we decide to delay a decision to deploy.

--Russians will use this an opportunity to reverse the Annan process and put the onus on the Western countries.

-- France will push for an immediate decision to deploy monitors.

--Russians have already portrayed the Paris meeting as an effort to derail the Annan process, delay will play into their
hands.
