Subject: Somali militants threaten suicide attacks in Kenya (AP)


MOGADISHU (AP) - A spokesman for the Somali militant group al-Shabab is threatening Kenya with suicide
attacks like those that killed 76 people in Uganda last year.
   Al-Shabab spokesman Ali Mohamud Rage told a news conference in Mogadishu on Monday that Kenya
must pull its troops out of Somalia. Lines of Kenyan troops poured into Somalia over the weekend. Kenyan
officials say the country has the right to defend itself from Somalia's most powerful militant group.
   Rage said Kenyans should remember what happened in Uganda a reference to the July 2010 bombings that
killed people who had gathered to watch the soccer World Cup final on TV. Rage said those attacks took place
because Uganda has troops in Mogadishu with the African Union military force.
