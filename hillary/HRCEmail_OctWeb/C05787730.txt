From Frank:

Key take-aways:

- Karzai was drawing a stark regional picture to get us to sign a binding SPD.

- Kayani discussion with Cameron also used the same language in 3.0 that we are viewing as a relatively positive step by
the GOP. Real disconnect on Afghan/Pak perceptions.

-- Discussion of out of villages was instructive on where Karzai going on reconciliation. Let the "bumpkins" come back.
