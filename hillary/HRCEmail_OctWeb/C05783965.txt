Subject: Togo elected to UN Security Council (AP)

UNITED NATIONS - (AP) Togo has been elected to the United Nations Security Council after balloting
went into subsequent rounds.
   Guatemala, Morocco and Pakistan were elected in the first round for five two-year terms beginning Jan. 1. A
fifth slot remains undecided.
   U.N. General Assembly members gave each of the four countries the two-thirds majority they needed Friday
to be elected to the U.N.'s most powerful body.
   But the fifth slot remained undecided after Azerbaijan and Slovenia, competing for the sole East European
opening, failed to obtain a majority. The 193-member General Assembly took a break and were to try again in
the afternoon.
   Security Council seats are highly coveted because they give countries a strong voice in matters dealing with
international peace and security.
