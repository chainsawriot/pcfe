"Top Secret: The Battle for the Pentagon Papers" takes an inside look at The Washington
Post's decision in 1971 to publish the top-secret study of US involvement in Vietnam
from 1945 to 1967.



A docudrama about the Pentagon Papers, one of the landmarks in American journalism
and the public's right to know, will be staged next week at the Shanghai Drama Arts
Center.

"Top Secret: The Battle for the Pentagon Papers" dramatizes the seismic legal battle that
goes to the heart of the debate about the nature of democracy in America. It is an inside
look at The Washington Post's decision in 1971 to publish the top-secret study of US
involvement in Vietnam from 1945 to 1967.

LA Theatre Works (LATW) will perform the work in English (with Chinese subtitles) from
next Tuesday through Sunday.

The publication of leaked documents that came to be known as the Pentagon Papers was
an explosive political event, shining light on years of US government secrecy and lies in
its policy in Vietnam and Southeast Asia. The battle pitted the press against the
government.

The documents were leaked to The New York Times, which published a front-page article
in 1971. When the Nixon White House obtained a court order preventing The Times from
printing most of the story, The Washington Post stepped into the fray and published the
documents.

"I've always loved dramas based on fact. The writer has to combine the requirements of
drama with the need to be accurate. At the very least, there is usually the need to
compress time and often to combine events," says playwright Geoffrey Cowan, president
of the public polilcy-oriented Annenberg Retreat at Sunnylands in Rancho Mirage,
California.

Most writers of such dramas take certain liberties with the facts by adding dialogue or
scenes that are consistent with the facts and with the values of the people themselves.

"In this case, the most interesting challenge has been created, by the continuing
availability of new information - such as newly released White House tapes or new
memoirs - that make for a richer drama," Cowan says..

The play explores the tension between US government's concern for secrecy on issues of
national security; the responsibility of the press to inform the public about issues of
great importance; and the court's role in determining when, if ever, the government has
the power to prevent the press from publishing.

American stage and TV stars Amy Pietz, James Gleason, Russell Soder, Josh Stamberg,
Henry Clarke, Nicholas Hormann, Tom Virtue, Peter Van Norden, Steve Vinovich and J.D.
Cullum - some starred in HBO hit "Sex and the City" - are cast in the play.

"I've never been to Asia and can't wait to experience Chinese culture, both ancient and
brand-new," says Josh Stamberg who plays The Washington Post Chief Editor Ben
Bradlee.

"It strikes me as the perfect time to visit Shanghai, with a wonderfully provocative play,
and definitively modern moment in the city's fabled history. I'm counting on Shanghai to
be an eye-opener," he tells Shanghai Daily through e-mail.

Stamberg's current TV role is in the series "Drop Dead Diva," which is about to start its
fourth season.

"In TV, you rehearse once or twice immediately before shooting, which is why
preparation is so crucial. The truth is theater's my first love. It's where I started, and
where I always return," says Stamberg.

For China tour, the play includes some fascinating and important information about the
planning process of President Nixon's trip to China in 1971.

"In the audience there will be students from law and journalism schools as well as a
great many people who want to learn more about how the American government
functions," Cowan says.

He says he expects the audience in Shanghai to enjoy the play and learn a lot about
history.

He observes that the media scene has been transformed since those days andlhe
Internet and organizations such as Wikileaks make it virtually impossible to keep
information secret indefinitely.
