Dear Cheryl,


My long time and good friend, Glenn Prickett, who is now the number two person at The Nature Conservancy
respectfully asked me to put in an encouraging word with Secretary Clinton regarding the invitation that she has
received from The Nature Conservancy. I always try to be judicious in my outreaches to the Secretary (and to you), but
feel this one is a most appropriate one.


I'm sure you know of The Nature Conservancy's longstanding, meaningful and important work in making our world a
better place from an environmental standpoint and more broadly. I have been proud to be associated with The Nature
Conservancy's efforts for over three decades now and was quite active in my participation and support during my tenure
as CEO of Arkla Gas. It was a natural partnership given the environmental qualities of natural gas and the Conservancy
initiatives. Donna also was quite active in the Arkansas chapter of The Nature Conservancy. One of the unique strengths
of the Nature Conservancy is their strong state network organizations.

I am sure that The Nature Conservancy dinner marking their 60th anniversary this Fall will be a well organized and special
occasion. Of course, I understand better than most the demands of the Secretary's schedule but sincerely feel this one is
worth her full consideration.

Thank you for your consideration and for handling these types of matters in your usual professional and courteous
manner.

Personally,
Mack
