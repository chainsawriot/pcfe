Subject: Israeli prime minister wins party leadership (AP)



JERUSALEM (AP) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has won the leadership race of his Likud
Party over his ultranationalist rival.
   Likud spokesman Yigal Movermacher said Netanyahu won over 75 percent of the vote early February 1.
  Netanyahu's victory confirms his leadership over the party at a time of faltering talks with the Palestinians.
   The relatively strong showing for his rival Moshe Feiglin suggests many Likud voters consider Netanyahu
soft on peacemaking with the Palestinians.
   Ahead of the vote January 31, Netanyahu approved new incentives to entice people to move to West Bank
settlements.
