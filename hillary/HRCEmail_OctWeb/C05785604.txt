Re: Crucial information for Libya


Cody, on his own, still at heart an indefatigable journalist, simply picked up the phone, dialing the number
given by Khalifa Sharif, and had a conversation with one of the key figures in the Libyan National Council that
seeks to become an interim government. Cody's notes, including Jipreel's phone numbers are below. Cody says
that Jipreel said he has not been contacted by anyone from the US government.

The note:

So I spoke to Dr. Mahmod Jipreel (he's on Khalifa's list) today. He was the former minister of planning but is
now the point man between the reformist government in waiting and the West. I spoke to him in Cairo. He will
fly tomorrow morning to Rome and then on to Strausborg, France, where he plans to address the European
Parliament on Wednesday morning. His cell phone numbers are as follows:
           Mahmod seems very smart, level-headed, has no desire to serve in a future government, only wants to
help in the transition. We talked for 20 minutes and he emphasized how important it is that any help from the
West, not to be perceived as interference by the heroic young people who are losing their lives in fighting the
madman. He thinks it is going to be a protracted battle but the West must recognize the temporary opposition
government ASAP......He told me that the chief medical director from the Red Crescent Society is Dr. Muftah

'wilib--cell number                       who is coordinating all medical relief efforts; obviously difficult to
.ach him on cell.

,omeone should contact Mahmod Jipreel. He is balanced, level-headed and understands current situation well.
le left the madman's government within past year when he realized he was completely deranged.
