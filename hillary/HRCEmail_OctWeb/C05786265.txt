KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan lawmakers have accepted President Hamid Karzai's offer to inaugurate parliament next week,
they said late Janaury 22, ending a standoff that had thrown the country into political turmoil. "We have agreed on
Karzai's request to open parliament on Wednesday and refrain from going to parliament tomorrow," said Sediq Ahmad
Usmani, a representative from Parwan province.
