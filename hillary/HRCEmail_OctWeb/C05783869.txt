  Subject: Libya "liberation" to be announced in Benghazi (Reuters)

  TRIPOLI, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The liberation of Libya will be declared on Saturday in the city of Benghazi, often
  referred to as the cradle of the revolution that overthrew Muammar Gaddafi, and not in the capital Tripoli,
  interim government officials told Reuters.

     The chairman of the ruling National Transitional Council, Mustafa Abdel Jalil, will make the announcement,
  the officials said.

     "The decision has been taken," an NTC official said. "The declaration of liberation will be in Benghazi, not
  Tripoli."

      Other NTC officials confirmed the decision to Reuters.
