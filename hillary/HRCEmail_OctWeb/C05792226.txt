Hi Clarissa,

Was good meeting you today, thank you for meeting us in Turkey. Hope you found the trip down from London
worthwhile.

I wanted to make sure you had all of Jake's contact info (below & attached) so you can take the Secretary up on her
offer to have him brief you whenever you're stateside. Not to mention that we get to London every now and again.
