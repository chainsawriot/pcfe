SMART is a cable distribution system. So it's just a means of routing it to places. Each embassy will have a SMART
portal, and this cable went to some of those embassies, as well as back here.

Jake, FYI - preliminary results show a big win for the PJD (the Islamist party), which means the prime minister will likely
be chosen from among the PJD as well

The latest from Mission Morocco. And to clarify — if the PJD majority holds, the King is expected to name the new Prime
Minister from the PJD. Thanks, Kate

1. (SBU) Summary: According to preliminary results released by the Moroccan Ministry of the Interior
(MOD, it appears that the Islamist Party of Justice and Development (PJD) is poised to win a significant
plurality as a result of the November 25 legislative elections. Unconfirmed MOI figures issued November 26
give the PJD 80 of the 395 available seats in parliament, with the next closest competitor having won only
45. At the time of the MOI release, 107 seats were still undetermined. If the results hold, the King must name
a Prime Minister from the PJD, who will then face the task of forming a governing coalition. Given the PJD's
surprising (apparent) margin of victory, that task will likely prove much less difficult than many had
expected. End Summary.

 Preliminary Results

 2. (SBU) As of 1400 local time on November 26, the tallying of the results from Morocco's November 25
 legislative election was still ongoing at MOI headquarters in Rabat. However, just after 1300 local time, the
 MOI placed on its web site its first set of partial, preliminary results. With 395 seats up for grabs, the MOI
 announced that counting was almost complete for the 305 seats contested on the local level. With results in for
 288 of the 305 locally contested seats, the results were as follows:

 Party of Justice and Development (PJD):              80 seats
 Istiqlal Party (IP):                                45 seats
 National Assembly of Independents (RNI):            38 seats
 Party of Authenticity and Modernity (PAM):          33 seats
 Union of Socialist Popular Forces (USFP):            29 seats

        UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784979 Date: 10/30/2015




Popular Movement (MP)                                22 seats
Constitutional Union (UC):                           15 seats
Party of Popular Socialism (PPS):                    11 seats

Ten smaller parties combined to win 15 seats, with none winning more than two seats. The MOI also
confirmed and overall turnout figure of 45%,which it had announced late the night of November 25 (Ref C).

A Big Win for the PJD

3. (SBU) These preliminary results must still be verified, and an additional 107 seats (17 from the local lists
and 90 from national lists) remain unconfirmed. (We estimate that results for all 305 local-level seats will be
announced before the end of the day November 26, while the count may take a bit longer for the 90 seats
contested on the national level.) Nevertheless, it appears from the preliminary results that the PJD is headed
for a big win. Having won only 46 seats in 2007, the PJD could easily double that tally this year once the
national list results have been determined.

4. (SBU) Comment: Even if Istiqlal or the RNI narrows the gap based on the results of the national lists, the
PJD's plurality appears very likely to hold. Should this prove the case, the King will be required, under the
new constitution, to name a Prime Minister from the PJD. Pre-election indications were that the PJD might
face some difficulties in finding other parties to join in an Islamist-led government (Ref A). This still could
prove the case, given the fact that the 8-party Alliance for Democracy (or "G-8") has already combined to win
115 seats, based on the preliminary results cited here (Ref B). However, few predicted that the PJD's margin
for victory would be so large, and if that margin remains high once the results are final, the PJD could find
itself with more potential partners than many expected. End Comment.
