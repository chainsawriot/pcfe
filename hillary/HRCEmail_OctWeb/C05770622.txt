Subject: Your policies and health care

Finally, I'm meeting with Robert Pear on Friday to pitch him on how so many of your ideas are in the health care bill and it
is closest to your proposal. He is biting on the idea, though, of course, I can't guarantee anything. I've held out for him,
but if he doesn't I can go to the Post or elsewhere. I have all I need on how the bill represents your campaign proposals
and the like. The one question I wanted to ask you is about your idea on using FEHBP as a kind of a public option. I know
you gave that to Rahm last August, and then mysteriously, it was in the Senate Finance package like a month later. None
of us had ever discussed it in the policy process of the WH and I didn't hear of it in the Hill, so my assumption is that
Rahm gave them your idea as a substitute for the public plan, which didn't have the votes. I know that was all top secret,
but I'm wondering if I should give Robert some hint of this only because it was a linchpin to moving the bill. I would get
him sniffing around on it, so he'd write it more as his own reporting discovery (hopefully). I know institutionally it was hard
for Rahm to be pitching public plan substitutes. On the other hand, everything is leaking out now, including our super
secret bill writing process in August. I can see the arguments on both sides of this, so wanted to check in on it.

Let me know if there's anything else for this story that would be helpful.

Hope you're well.

Neera
