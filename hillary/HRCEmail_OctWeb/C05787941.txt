Subject: Zardari returns to Pakistan from Dubai trip-spokesman (Reuters)


ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - President Asif Ali Zardari returned to Pakistan on Friday from a trip to Dubai, his
spokesman said, as speculation swirled over whether he would survive heightened tension between his civilian
government and the country's powerful military.

  "The president returned to Islamabad in the wee hours of Friday morning," the spokesman, Farhatullah
Babar, told Reuters.

   A disputed memo allegedly from Zardari's government seeking U.S. help in reining in the military has
soured relations to their lowest point since a coup in 1999.

   Military sources say that while they would like Zardari to go, it should be through constitutional means, not
another of the coups that have marked half of Pakistan's almost 65 years of independence
