Dear Cheryl and Andrew,

The WH roll out plan includes the need for State to brief our committees (SFRC, HFAC, SAC-FOPS, HAC-FOPS, House
OGR, National Security and Foreign Affairs subcmte) tomorrow on the strategy. Were HRC here, she would be asked to
do this briefing (Gates, Mullen, Blair are doing their committees). In her absence, we are currently working with H to set
up joint briefings for the committees (combined on the House and Senate sides) that Jim and Jack will do together in the
afternoon â€” House at 2pm, Senate at 3:45pm.

While this is still in the works, I wanted to let you know the plan as it currently stands. Please let me know if you see any
problems with this. Also let me know if you would like to see the WH roll out plan, which I can forward (at least the
latest draft I have).

Finally, Jim asked whether HRC did the calls to Kerry and Lugar before she left?

Best, Sheba

Sheba Crocker
Chief of Staff, Deputy Secretary Steinberg
