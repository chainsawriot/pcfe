I'm sure the Ferraro memorial will bring back a gush of memories. You have had many vigorous defenders but no one
was as fierce as she. Every time I saw her during the campaign, I got an earful. If she thought someone was unfair to you,
they heard from her! And, of course, she did among the heaviest lifting to defend the universality of human rights at the
Beijing conference. I remember her rounding up all the Catholics on the delegation one Sunday in Beijing to get to the
Mass the Vatican delegate was officiating (during tough negotiations with the Vatican) to prove that our team had a lot
of shared values! Ever the politician.
I will miss her.

I'm heading back from Texas where the Bushes have been hosting a conference on role of women in Afghanistan. They
were all there from Hadley and Khalizad to Hughes and the former president. Karzai is going to be on live via video today
but I had to head back. I spoke last night on our continuing commitment to women in our afghan policy and mentioned
what you said about Mrs Bush at the House hearing. An Afghan participant from MFA mentioned the effectiveness of US
advocacy for women saying that "Madame Clinton" played a big role on women's participation in the peace jirga and on
the shelter issue. It was all well received. There was also much private conversation about the need to improve the
relationship with Karzai (more on this).
