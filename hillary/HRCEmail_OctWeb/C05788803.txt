I spoke with Gail Collins last week, and sent her the speech. She was away and didn't have a column on
Saturday - but we left it that we'd talk again tomorrow, and I offered to put you on the phone with her. That
would obviously go a long way to giving the speech legs.

As far as owning the phrase, this may sound goofy but we should see if www.partcipationage.com is available,
and secure it.


Great ideas--="fitalk w Gail and pis try to get domain name.

I kind of heard that u were setting up or thinking about a foreign policy advisory council can't remember exactly. If you
are--- pick ten of those people get on a conference cal! with them on Mondayand ask them to find ways they can validate
the points you made in the speech (they can validate it by putting it in their blocs, or newsletters or in up coming
speeches.) -- .,,specially pushing the "Participation Age" -- which should become a living legacy phrase for you -- got to
get the phrase branded as your quickly. m
