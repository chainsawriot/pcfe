Highlights:

ECOWAS delegation met with mutineers minus Capt Sanogo at the Bamako airport last
night. Delegation returned very early this morning. ADO described it as a "good meeting," which
laid out ECOWAS' demands.

Junta invited to ECOWAS Summit on Tuesday to explain its actions/reasons and to hear further from
ECOWAS about next steps. ADO also said that he had just taken a call from Capt Sanogo. Sanogo
asked if he could send someone to represent him. ADO said that would be fine. ADO also urged
Sanogo to issue a communiqué that offers assurances to the safety and security of ATT and the
government. Sanogo said he would issue such a statement later today.

ADO described them as a very young group that does not know what to do. "They are totally
isolated, no one supports them, no parties, the rest of the military, civil society - no one supports
them. They are from one ethnic group. They are Gao and the rest of the military doesn't support
them." I told ADO that ECOWAS will need to help these mutineers walk their coup back. He agreed
completely. ADO said that his CHOD, Gen Bakayoko, is in contact with them and they respect him
as elder officer.

ADO spoke of the political steps to get the constitutional process/order back on track in Mali. He
said the PM and National Assembly President will need to go to the Supreme Court to designate the
NA Pres as interim President and move to elections as close to schedule as possible. He added that
Gen Bakayoko is reaching out to the Malian senior military to see if the Malian Deputy CHOD can be
designated as CHOD to keep the military under control.

ADO was bemused by the fact that the MNLA had also condemned the coup. "These guys (Sanogo
and his crowd) really do not have any support. They find themselves holding a hot potato."

He asked again if ATT is at the US Embassy. He said that Wade had told him that he (Wade) had
spoken the our Ambassador in Mali who confirmed this. I told ADO that this was incorrect and that
our Ambassador is currently in Paris waiting for a flight to get back into Bamako.

He stated that there are no plans to evacuate the ECOWAS Ag delegation in Bamako. "We have no
means to do that." He agreed that it is better for the safety of the 200+ delegates to remain in their

hotel. ADO offered assurances that should AMCITS arrive in Abidjan as evacuees from Bamako, they
will be able to get airport visas.
