Subject: A message for the Secretary

Madam Secretary,


I just gave Melanne Verveer a goodbye hug as she wrapped up her visit to Bangladesh and departed for Nepal. She
worked great magic here connecting with Bangladeshis across the spectrum from ministers and Nobel Laureate Md.
Yunus to Grameen borrowers and Grameen "walkers" (beggar women) whom she met when we visited a village to see
Grameen in action. Her genuine warmth and respect for Bangladeshis electrified the villagers and, through expansive
media coverage, the nation, as she brought the best of America to the people.


She also used the visit to great effect in delivering a clear message that America cares deeply about Grameen and wants
to see Grameen effectiveness and integrity continue undiminished in bringing hope to millions of Bangladesh's most
vulnerable, especially poor women. She urged timely selection of a new Grameen managing director who is renowned,
respected, above reproach and who has deep passion for the Grameen philosophy. Her message was spot-on, and I am
so grateful that she delivered it so effectively.


I assure you Mission Dhaka will arduously build on Melanne's legacy as we work hard and smart to get the government
to ensure the next Grameen managing director is the right person to sustain the institution. I hope success in this regard
will help create an environment conducive to your visiting Bangladesh, where I would want to take you to a village so
you, too, can experience the Grameen magic at work.


All the best as the new year continues,


Dan Mozena
Ambassador to Bangladesh
