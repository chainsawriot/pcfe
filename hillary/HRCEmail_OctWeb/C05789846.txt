Sergey just reported on his bilat. Cathy now seeing Jalili. We expect no other bilaterals. Cathy will debrief and then we
will have final plenary. Cathy will then do press announcement. I will then background our press. Appears that Cathy will
be asked to agree to preparatory meeting of deputies/experts before next meeting likely May 10 in Baghdad (Baghdad
does not yet know officially). We are all for such a meeting, as well as a 8+1 and E3+3 preparatory meetings. So will be
very busy next few weeks. Will debrief detail of conversations in secure channels. Good that we are talking about
nuclear, urgency, step by step, etc. but very, very long way to destination. Next meeting will be much more difficult.
Nonetheless, this outcome today is certainly preferable to what might have been.
