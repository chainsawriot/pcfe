Subject: grapel case

I spoke to the Prime Minister about the Grapel case one on one today. He had already spoken a couple of weeks ago
with EGIS and I believe the ForMin had written to him as well. He seemed to accept that the case most probably was
not what the Egyptian press claimed—Israeli spy—although he also believed that Grapel had done illegal things in
Egypt. He did express some interest in avoiding a bilateral problem. While I'm still concerned about leaks regarding US
interventions coming from the Prime Minister's office, since I have raised it with him, a phone call from S might help. I
do not believe PM has a deciding vote, and the more important calls would be to Tantawi (I think it should be from
Gates) and Sami Enan in MOD. Bottom line is that someone in the GOE, has to call the prosecutor and persuade him
that expulsion is better than a trial.

We need to continue to be discreet about the phone calls and conversations we are having on this—if the press begins
to portray a US campaign to interfere in this matter it will make resolution even harder. ms
