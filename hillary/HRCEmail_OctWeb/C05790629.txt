All:

I just got off the phone with Anna Schecter—the producer at NBC.

1. the promo I saw this weekend was pulled after one airing.

2. the piece will have two parts with a commercial in the middle.

3. Each piece will be around 7:23 sec (roughly...). The first is all about Doyle Meyer. It is extremely hard on ERDT. It has
bites from Jessica Vaughan from the immigration group that is wholly anti-state department.

4. Second part is all Toria with a bite from Jessica Vaughan stuck in there. Apparently Toria has the final word with the
something along the lines of: "one child is one to many" and "S said we needed to fix this"

5. They will flash on the screen the following stats: 15 sponsors over the last 10 years have faced allegations (Rick: can
we see if they might overlap with ones sanctioned?); "More than 60 cases" of reported abuse over the last 10 years.

6. The first teaser/web video is below

7. There will be a web post on the kids in Minnesota who are loving it, but they are not in the piece. The reason was that
she felt if they were close to Doyle Meyer segment it would be assumed they had grievances too...this gives you a sense
of tone

8. A video of "just Toria" will be posted after the piece too.

9. Anna sees me as on her side so I asked "is there going to be a point that makes me go—they screwed us?" She said
no. ERDT may feel that way though.

10. Thanks again to Toria for acing the interview!

 Let me know if you have questions.
