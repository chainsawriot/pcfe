Subject: from Tony Campolo...

Rev. Campolo called me yesterday. We had a great visit.
                                                                                            where I often lead sessions on
advocacy and he speaks... such a joy. And,                                                                      . anyway,
he called and we had a good visit... his purpose was asking that I supply you with the below note... He assumes I do it
thru a staffer who travels with you... I hope you are well... I note you have been moving about in one of my fav regions of
the planet... in my 20's, with my trusted backpack, I really gave those wonderful Asian and SE Asian nations a going
over... Here's the note from Tony:


Dear Hillary,

Tony
