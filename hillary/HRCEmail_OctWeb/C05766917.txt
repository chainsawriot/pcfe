Madame Secretary --

We just had a good dinner brainstorming session
regarding what the Administration's development legacy might be seven years from now.

It was the sort of discussion we should have had at the beginning of the various processes. I think we generated some
good and creative ideas and look forward to teeing them up for discussion by the Deputies and Principals in the coming
days.

Thank you for your patience. We'll get there. In the meantime, if you have any concerns, please let me know.

Mike Froman
