Subject: Ukraine's president hints at Tymoshenko reprieve (AP



KIEV (AP) - Ukraine's president is hinting that new legislation being debated in parliament may allow
reconsideration of the case of jailed former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko.
   In an interview with leading Ukrainian television channels Friday night, President Viktor Yanukovych said
he is interested in finding the "right solution" and reviewing Tymoshenko's case according to "European
standards."
   Tymoshenko is serving out a seven-year jail term on charges of abuse of office while negotiating a gas
contract with Russia in 2009. The West has condemned the verdict as politically motivated.
   Yanukovych did not indicate exactly how changing the country's criminal code my affect Tymoshenko's case.
He has floated that possibility in the past.
