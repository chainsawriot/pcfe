Subject:                       senate supplemental update



Kyl, Cornyn and McCain amendments on border security all were defeated on budgets points of order. Each
of the three amendments failed to get the required 60 votes needed to waive the point of order.

And the Feingold amendment requiring a withdrawal plan from Afghanistan failed 18 to 80.

The Coburn amendments, imposing broad cuts across the entire govt in order to pay down the deficit were
also defeated. Inouye successfully moved to table both amendments (53 to 45 and 50 to 47)

The Senate just voted to invoke cloture now (69 to 29) and we would expect a vote on final passage this
evening.

The good news thus far is that our programs and funding levels as reported in committee have remained in
tact. We also are likely to get the Iraq transfer authority and Afghan police training language we were seeking
in the final manager's amendment.
