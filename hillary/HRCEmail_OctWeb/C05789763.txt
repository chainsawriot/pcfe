Got it. Will confirm. We just received a revised call sheet which I sent to Oscar to print for you but here it is below as
well.




The Secretary's Call Sheet for

Cote d'Ivoire President Alassane Ouattara [WAH-ta-rah]



Purpose of Call: To confirm the ECOWAS strategy on Mali and coordinate on any outcomes from the ECOWAS-AU
delegation's meetings in Bamako.




 Background:

Mali: President Ouattara assumed his position as Chairman of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) on February 17. He dispatched a joint ECOWAS-African Union (AU) delegation on March 23 to speak with the
mutineers. The delegation included ECOWAS Commission President Ouedraogo, UN Office of West Africa Special
Representative to the Secretary General (SRSG) Djinnit, and the Nigerian and Cote d'Ivoire Chiefs of Defense. The joint
delegation delivered a message on Friday to representatives of mutiny leader Capt. Sanogo calling for Mali to return to
civilian government. Amb. Carter in Abidjan spoke to Pres. Ouattara on Saturday. Ouattara told Carter he took a call
from Sanogo to reiterate the ECOWAS message. He also urged Sanogo to issue a communiqu√© offering assurances to
the safety of President Toure and his government. Ouattara told Sanogo he could attend the ECOWAS heads of state
emergency meeting on Mali, planned for Tuesday, March 27, or send a representative. Pres. Toure's whereabouts are
still unknown.

We understand ECOWAS is working on a proposal to the mutineers that may involve the resignation of President Toure
and a return to a transitional government under National Assembly President Diacounda Traore, who is next in line
constitutionally. Traore is also a presidential candidate, which may complicate his ability to lead the transition; the first
round of presidential elections was originally scheduled for April 29.




World Bank: South Africa nominated Nigerian Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala to lead the World Bank, though
one of President Jonathan's advisors told us he doesn't expect her nomination to prevail. Media report Ouattara is
supportive of Ngozi's candidacy, but he told Amb. Carter he is interested and available to meet Dr. Kim should he visit
Abidjan. The Dominican Republic has nominated former Colombian Finance Minister Jose Antonio Ocampo for the
post. Economist Jeffrey Sachs withdrew his candidacy and supported Dr. Kim upon President Obama's announcement.
