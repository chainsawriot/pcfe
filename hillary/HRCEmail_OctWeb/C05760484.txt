I hope there's something we can do. Let's discuss soon.

Yes, I read the story yesterday and have been in touch with Glamour and our post. I think her family needs to be
compensated in some way because they raise feeding her and transportation as expenses they can't meet in order to
send her to school.

Subject: Noon i All

Do you recall Noon i Ali(?), the ten year old Yemeni girl who got herself divorced? I met her at the Glamour awards last
year. There was a CNN story last few days about how unhappy she is, still living at home, not attending school and quite
angry that her life is not better. Is there any way we can help her? Could we get her to the US for counselling and
education?
