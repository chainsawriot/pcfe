Jake:

Text is in Portuguese. Part on Honduras talks about need to set correct anti-coup precedent in region. Lula ready for
dialogue and thanks US for support for Brazilian emb in Honduras. But cites Rio Group declaration calling for Z
restitution before elections if elections are to be legit.

Will send this now and summarize other parts next.
