Cuba blames US for Summit of the Americas snub

HAVANA (AP) â€” Cuba is accusing Washington of pressuring to keep the island nation from
attending next month's Summit of the Americas.

Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez says it's no surprise given past U.S. policy
toward the communist-run island.

He calls it a "chronicle of an exclusion foretold," playing off the title of a novella by
Colombian writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez.

Rodriguez spoke at a news conference Thursday, a day after President Raul Castro met with
Juan Manuel Santos of summit host Colombia.

Santos indicated that his country would not be inviting Cuba.

Members of the leftist ALBA bloc of nations had proposed a possible summit boycott if
Cuba was not invited.

U.S. officials say Cuba does not meet the summit's standards for democracy.
