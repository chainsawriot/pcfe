I shared with Sheryl Sandberg the portion of your interview with Rachel Combe of Elle that was about her. Sheryl sent
the thank you note below through Sarah Feinberg (formerly of Rahm's office, currently working with Joe Lockhart at
Facebook).




Secretary Clinton,

I saw the comments you made in Elle and wanted to say thank you.

Your personal comments about me were so nice and so appreciated. On the debate on the "ambition gap", you
summarized more clearly what I am trying to say than anyone has by far. You are exactly right. I am frustrated by all of
the ways women hold themselves back and feel less confident than they should. My point has been to try to empower
them to believe they can do it and therefore get the leadership roles they deserve. Thank you for understanding and for
being able to say this so clearly.

The highlight of my last few weeks was not the filing of our S-1, but the invitation to have dinner with you. I am really
looking forward to it. I also have had a chance to get to know Chelsea a bit recently and as you of course know, she is
spectacular.

I look forward to seeing you soon.

Warmly yours,

Sheryl
