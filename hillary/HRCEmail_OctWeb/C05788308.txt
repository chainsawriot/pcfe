Hillary,



Wanted to weigh in on the WSJ oped. So probably not what you are looking for but so true on so many levels.
Why it takes failure to see true talent remains one of my greatest questions from this phase of my career. Everything
mentioned has always been the case about you and your capacity as a leader.
