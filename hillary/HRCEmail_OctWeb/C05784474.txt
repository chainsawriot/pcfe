The Secretary's Call Sheet for
Egyptian Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr

Purpose of Call: To urge the Egyptian government to take steps to restrain from the use of violence against
demonstrators, to restore calm, and to create the conditions for free and fair parliamentary elections.


                                                                                                                           B5




Background:
Egypt: In a speech November 22 on national TV, Field Marshal Tantawi committed to hold parliamentary elections on
time (beginning Monday, November 28), to hold presidential elections by June 2012, and appoint a "national salvation
government" to replace Prime Minister Shares cabinet. The current cabinet will remain in place until the new

government is appointed, and the SCAF will continue to operate as the executive until a president is elected. Protesters
in Tahrir Square reacted immediately, chanting "Leave, leave!" Many commented on the speech's defensive tone.
There were few indications the demonstrators intended to go home, indicating that at least for now, it was not enough
to appease them.



The protests began on November 18, when thousands of demonstrators converged on Tahrir Square to protest the
military's rule and the idea that the SCAF is trying to carve out special privileges for the military in Egypt's new
constitution through a proposed supra-constitutional principles document. Most political groups participated, including
both Islamists and liberal groups. The death toll has reached at least 38, and well over 1,000 have been injured.
Elections are still scheduled as planned to begin on Monday, November 28. The recent protests raise significant security
and logistical concerns. NDI and IRI are poised to field nearly 170 witnesses (a term the Egyptian government prefers to
monitors or observers) over the three phases of the elections. We have engaged with the SCAF on the importance of
their observation mission and understand that they will be formally accredited by Egyptian authorities.




Syria: Amr stated November 15 that Egypt will not withdraw its ambassador to Syria. Egypt's embassy in Damascus was
not attacked in the recent spate of aggression against diplomatic missions. Following the November 16 suspension of
Syria's membership in the Arab League (AL), the SARG rejected the AL's proposal for an observer mission to
Syria. Members of AL special committee on Syria are meeting on November 23 to discuss further actions, including
sanctions, in preparation for a full Arab League Foreign Ministers meeting tomorrow, November 24.
