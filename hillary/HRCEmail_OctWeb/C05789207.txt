Jake, Huma, Capricia,

We have worked to enhance the conduct of multilateral diplomacy by improving three areas: training, promotion and
recognition of multilateral diplomacy.

We have implemented phases one and two by working with FSI to rewrite the Multilateral Diplomacy course; the revised
course was launched in 2011. We are working with the DG's office on promotion parameters.

I would like to share with you our plans for phase three, creation of a Department award for multilateral diplomacy.

We have worked with L/Ethics and EUR-I0/EX/HR on how to create an award for multilateral diplomacy. I am delighted
to tell you the former Secretary Madeleine K. Albright has agreed that the award may be created in her name.

I am forming a small group to work on realizing the project and would like to include S staff, SIP, and Protocol. 10
Senior Advisor Christopher Le Mon is working closely with me on this project. The plan will include outside
fundraising. I would welcome your ideas. I would be happy to brief you or your representative our plan to accomplish
the task in 2012. We think this would be a fine legacy for the Department of State.

Esther

Dr. Esther Brimmer
Assistant Secretary
