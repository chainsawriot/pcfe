THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary



FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE March 14, 2010

Statement by National Security Council Spokeman Mike Hammer on the murders in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico


The President is deeply saddened and outraged by the news of the brutal murders of three people associated with the
United States Consulate General in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, including a U.S. citizen employee, her U.S. citizen husband,
and the husband of a Mexican citizen employee. He extends his condolences to the families and condemns these attacks
on consular and diplomatic personnel serving at our foreign missions. In concert with Mexican authorities, we will work
tirelessly to bring their killers to justice.

The President shares in the outrage of the Mexican people at the murders of thousands in Ciudad Juarez and elsewhere
in Mexico. We will continue to work with Mexican President Felipe Calderon and his government to break the power of the
drug trafficking organizations that operate in Mexico and far too often target and kill the innocent. This is a responsibility
we must shoulder together, particularly in border communities where strong bonds of history, culture, and common
interest bind the Mexican and the American people closely together.
