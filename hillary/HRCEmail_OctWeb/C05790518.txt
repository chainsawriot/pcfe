           The foreign policy of the United States requires consistent direction and
           management. There will be changes in ambassadorial appointments after
           the election but it is important that posts not be vacated prematurely.
           We expect that all ambassadors will remain at their posts until replacements
           are confirmed or specific departure instructions are given.
