Subject: Jake is available if you would like to call back in to Ops

Madam Secretary,

Jake is available to speak with you. Ops will connect the call whenever you are able to call back in. Ops is also reaching
out for call windows for Secretary General Rasmussen and the Cambodian PM. We will let you know once we have call
windows.

Thank you,
Bernadette
