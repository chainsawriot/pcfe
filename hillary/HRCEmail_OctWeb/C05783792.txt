Subject: UN reinstates Libya to Human Rights Council (AP)



UNITED NATIONS - (AP) The U.N. General Assembly has voted to reinstate Libya's membership on the
Human Rights Council.
   The 193-member world body suspended Libya from the U.N.'s top human rights body on March 1 as part of
the international effort to halt Moammar Gadhafi's violent crackdown on protesters.
   With Gadhafi's death and a new interim Libyan government in place, the General Assembly adopted a
resolution Friday by a vote of 123-4 with six abstentions to restore Libya's rights on the council.
   The four countries voting "no" were Venezuela, Nicaragua, Bolivia and Ecuador.
   Before the vote, Libya's deputy U.N. ambassador Ibrahim Dabbashi stressed the National Transitional
Council's commitment to defend human rights.
