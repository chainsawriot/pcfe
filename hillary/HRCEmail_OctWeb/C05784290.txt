Subject: US senator talks about military option in Syria (AP)

SOUTHERN SHUNEH, Jordan (AP) - U.S. Senator John McCain says now that NATO military intervention in
Libya is ending, military action to protect civilians in Syria might be considered.
   However, the U.S. administration has made clear it has no appetite for military intervention in Syria _ a close
ally of Iran that sits on Israel's border.
   Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Jordan Sunday, the Republican senator said like Libya's
Moammar Gadhafi, Syrian President Bashar Assad is committing "mass murder" against his people and warned
he will not get away with it. McCain said the Assad regime has "spilled too much blood" and its days are
numbered.
   He also said Iran was trying to "hijack" the Arab Spring.
