Subject: Ghana Focus is governance

 Cheryl,

 As of now the focus of the POTUS speech in Ghana will be on governance. Confirmed w/ desk officer and talked to Chris
 at NSC. But, speech is fluid and could change. Here is WH press release:

"The president and Mrs. Obama look forward to strengthening the U.S. relationship with one of our most
trusted partners in sub-Saharan Africa, and to highlighting the critical role that sound governance and civil
society play in promoting lasting development," the White House said in a written statement.
