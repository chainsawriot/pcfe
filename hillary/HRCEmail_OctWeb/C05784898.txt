Subject: Pakistani FM says NATO strike negates progress (AP)

ISLAMABAD (AP) - Pakistan's foreign minister has told U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton that
an alleged NATO attack that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers has negated progress in improving the tattered alliance
between the two countries.
   Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar told Clinton Sunday that the attack was unacceptable, showed complete
disregard for human life and sparked rage within Pakistan. The prime minister's office issued a press release
describing the conversation.
   The U.S. says Clinton expressed sympathy over the incident and promised the U.S. would work with Pakistan
as NATO conducts an investigation.
   Pakistan has retaliated by closing its Afghan border crossings to NATO supplies and giving the U.S. 15 days
to vacate an air base used by American drones.
