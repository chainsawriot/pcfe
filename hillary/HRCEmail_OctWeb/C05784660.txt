Subject: Google donates $11.5 million to fight modern slavery -- Slavey Footprint gets some money

More slavery footprint results: largest corporate donation ever in TIP space came on the heels of our seeding SF (and
using that as a way in to Google to show them that TIP world was innovative, interesting, techy, etc)...

And thanks Alec for tweeting the MTV-U campus broadcast tomorrow.

Google Donates    $11.5 Million To Fight Modern-Day Slavery

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/14/google-donation-slavery n 114773 0.html

Tech giant Google announced Wednesday it is donating $11.5 million to several coalitions fighting to end the
modern-day slavery of some 27 million people around the world.

In what is believed to be the largest ever corporate grant devoted to the advocacy, intervention and rescue of
people being held, forced to work or provide sex against their will, Google said it chose organizations with
proven records in combating slavery.

"Many people are surprised to learn there are more people trapped in slavery today than any time in history,"
said Jacquelline Fuller, director of charitable giving and advocacy for Google. "The good news is that there are
solutions."

The Washington, D.C.-based International Justice Mission, a human rights organization that works globally to
rescue victims of slavery and sexual exploitation, was chosen by Google to lead the efforts.
