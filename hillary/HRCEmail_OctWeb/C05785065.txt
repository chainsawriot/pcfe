It was an exhausting trip to the climate conf, but I'm glad we were there. It created goodwill for the US when there was
little to go around. Many of your FM friends were grateful that we boosted the gender cause and your video for REDD in
memory of Wangari was well received. After I met with the US delegation, they made more of an effort on gender in
the text negotiations and some good progress resulted. It's unfathomable to me how we can ignore the role of women
in addressing climate change from ag to green technology. I did a number of bilats on cookstoves and there's more
interest. It's endless

Good news on Georgetown. The women peace and security inst is a GO. It will be in your speech on the 19th and we'll
work to make it good for you.
