Please flag for MG

As they committed during Indian Commerce Minister Sharma's visit earlier this month and projected as far back as
Minister Fahim's September 2011 visit to India, Pakistan's cabinet approved a new negative list with India today (before
the end of February).

The new negative list of 1209 restricted product lines (of about 6800 tradeable categories) replaces the previous positive
list of about 1900 allowable product lines. This more than doubling of tradeable goods roughly meets my expectations
but may be a disappointment given the wild hopes of some in New Delhi, especially given that the negative list rejected
by cabinet two weeks ago included only 636 products. The late additions reflect last minute pressure from the
autoparts, machinery, and textiles industries. Implementation is set to occur within one month, and the goal is still to
phase out the list by end 2012 and to announce Most Favored Nation status at that point. (Comment: Though I am
skeptical that they will be able to move that fast given the political calendar and industry pressures. Other countries,
including India, maintain a limited sensitive list and are considered technically WTO. compliant.)

This is real and historic progress for Indo-Pakistan relations, a big victory for Zardari's government, and a real
achievement for the New Silk Road vision.

Make that 1209 items. Minor, but the fewer, the better...

Good news on the Indo-Pak trade front.

Cabinet just approved the negative list. See Lisa's Dion the high side to go out shortly. 636 items grew to 1239, but still
great news. Additions were as expected -- auto parts, machinery, and textiles.

Commerce is meant to implement within one month. They also have notice to phase it out by the end of 2012.

Kudos to Lisa for following this so closely and so well.
