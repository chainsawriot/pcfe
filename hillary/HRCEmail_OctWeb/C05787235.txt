Hillary: The American Academy has contacted me, confused about what's happening with your prospective participation in
the Holbrooke memorial there on April 15th. They tell me they still don't have a commitment from your people at State and
are tearing their hair out. Can someone sort this out and make it happen? Thanks. Sid
