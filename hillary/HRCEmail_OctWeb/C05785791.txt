Summary: Maliki called for the KRG to turn in Hashimi to the judiciary, saying it should not "appear to be aiding a
wanted figure escape." He stated Parliament is required to dismiss Salih al-Mutlaq, and cabinet ministers not attending
cabinet meetings will be considered to have resigned. He said a majority government is the alternative "if the
constitution is not taken as a reference," and he himself calls for a majority government because "a partnership
government is not efficient." On the U.S., Maliki stated that 700 U.S. trainers will remain inside camps Iraq to train Iraqi
forces. He said the U.S. Embassy staff has not exceeded 2,000 employees, and will be subject to visa requirements
which will allow the GOI to know their number. In addition, Iraq itself has requested specialists in fields such agriculture
and industry, which might be a reason for the increase the number of employees.




Detailed Highlights:




Security, Justice, and Political Issues

•     Security is not a subject for negotiation with anyone, internally or externally. Security and justice are independent
and nobody has the right to speak about justice.        There is no other option but to resort to the constitution, which is
the key point in resolving any problems we have, which are many. All initiatives should be done according to the
Constitution, even in our initiative on Syrian crisis.    When we disagree on the constitution, there are other channels
for resolving issues, such as Parliament, the Shura Council, Judiciary system, and others.         I cannot say the
constitution is complete [without problematic issues], but working with it is far better than working without it and we
should not reject it.      Justice and security should not be politicized, and we should separate between criminal and
political cases, and all should be done in accordance with constitution. There are mechanisms set forth by the
constitution to define the authorities vested in all government agencies and how to coordinate between them.                A
majority government is the alternative if the constitution is not taken as a reference.        I for one call for a majority
government in the next stage because a partnership government is not efficient.           The judiciary is not perfect, but it is
not politicized.

Hashimi

•    The confessions [regarding Hashimi] were aired after permission from the judiciary, the Iraqi judiciary allows this.•
Evidence is present at the judiciary, and it shows whether [the evidence and confessions] were taken under duress or
not.      Hashimi's case is not new, but it was delayed due to forming the government and reconciliation, and also the
continuation of killings prompted us to take action. I received new information on crime just before heading on my
recent trip abroad.       Arab League intervention [in the Hashimi issue] is rejected•   The KRG should not allow VP
Hashimi to "escape," and should turn him in to the judiciary. Judicial orders apply to the entire country, including the
Kurdistan region. We hope that the KRG will not appear as if to be aiding a wanted figure escape.

Iraqiyya Boycott

•    Cabinet ministers not attending cabinet meetings will be considered to have resigned.            Only four ministers so
far have boycotted cabinet meetings.

Mutlaq

•   I did not threaten to resign if Mutlaq was not voted out by Parliament, but Parliament is required to dismiss Salih.
