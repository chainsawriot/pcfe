Subject: Islamists win most seats in Moroccan vote (Reuters)

RABAT, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Morocco's PJD party will be the biggest party in parliament based on the final
results of Friday's election, the interior ministry said on Sunday, paving the way for the moderate Islamist party
to lead a coalition government.

   Results for the 395-seat parliament show PJD won 107 seats, and the Istiqlal party, with which the PJD
wants to form a coalition, was in second place with 60 seats, the ministry said in a statement carried by the
official news agency MAP.

  King Mohammed is expected to pick a prime minister from PJD, with its secretary general Abdelilah
Benkirane touted for the job.,
