Subject: S Signature on Award

Colleagues, the Department Awards Committee is on the verge of approving a nomination from Ryan Crocker
and Marc Grossman for the Department's Distinguished Honor Award (not the Distinguished Service Award
which the Secretary usually presents) to Navy Captain Patrick Neher, who played a pivotal role in concluding
the Strategic Partnership Agreement with Afghanistan. The award certificate normally bears the Secretary's
signature. SRAP is sending someone to Kabul tomorrow who could deliver the certificate in time for Neher's
departure from post next week and asks whether it would be possible to get the certificate signed by then -
would that be possible?

Thanks,

Steve
