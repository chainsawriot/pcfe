Subject: Former Macedonian president Kiro Gligorov dies (AP)



SKOPJE (AP) - Kiro Gligorov, the first democratically elected president of Macedonia who served two terms at
the helm of the country in the 1990s as it became independent from Yugoslavia, has died. He was 94.
   The head of Gligorov's office, Zivko Kondev, said Monday that the former president died in his sleep at his
home in the Macedonian capital, Skopje, on Sunday evening.
   Gligorov became president of Macedonia in January 1991, when it was still a Yugoslav republic. He led his
countrymen through a referendum, in which they voted for independence. The territory of 2.1 million people
became the only republic to secede from Yugoslavia without a war.
