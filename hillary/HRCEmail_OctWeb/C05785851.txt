Subject: Syria says oil output cut by third due to sanctions (Reuters)

CAIRO, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Syrian Oil Minister Sufian Alao said on Saturday that his country's oil production
had fallen by about 30 to 35 percent as a result of sanctions imposed on Syria over its nine-month crackdown on
anti-government protests.

  The European Union hsa stepped up its sanctions against Syria's oil industry, including blacklisting state-
owned firms.

   "We reduced our production by 30 to 35 percent till we resume exports," he told reporters on the sidelines of
a Arab oil ministers meeting in Cairo, adding that current output was about 260,000 barrels per day.
