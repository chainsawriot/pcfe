Subject: Pakistani lawmakers slam US after private session with military leaders


  ISLAMABAD - (AP) Pakistan's Parliament has passed a resolution slamming the United States for the raid
that killed al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden, calling it an attack on Pakistan's sovereignty.
   The resolution also criticizes U.S. missile strikes in Pakistan's tribal areas. It says the government should
consider barring U.S. and NATO supply trucks from using land routes in Pakistan if the drone attacks continue.
   At the same time, lawmakers are calling for an independent commission to investigate the bin Laden raid.
Pakistan's prime minister has said the military would lead the probe, but opposition leaders say that's not good
enough.
   The resolution followed a rare, private session with top military officials that began yesterday and ran past
midnight. During the session, Pakistan's intelligence chief indicated he'd be willing to resign if lawmakers
demanded it, but no one did.
