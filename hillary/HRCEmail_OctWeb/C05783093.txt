Subject: Syrian troops fire during protests; 9 killed (AP)

  BEIRUT - (AP) At least nine people have been killed in Syria today after protesters took to the streets to test
whether President Bashar Assad's regime would abide by an Arab League plan to end violence in the country.
  Activists say Syrian security forces opened fire in the central city of Horns and suburbs of the capital,
Damascus. One human rights lawyer based in Syria says today's action shows the government "is not serious"
about ending the crackdown and is only "playing for time" with the international community.
  The Arab League accord announced two days ago calls for Assad's regime to withdraw tanks and armored
vehicles from cities, release all political prisoners and stop violence against protesters.
  But just a day later, security forces in Horns reportedly killed at least 18 people.
