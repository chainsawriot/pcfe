Subject: Karzai says he met with Afghan insurgent faction (AP)


KABUL (AP) - Afghanistan's President Karzai says he has personally met with a delegation from the insurgent
faction Hizb-i-Islami for peace negotiations that he hopes "will have good results."
  Karzai's January 21 announcement to parliament appears to assert his own standing in any future peace
process by showing his ability to bring militant factions other than the Taliban to the negotiating table. He did
not specify when the meeting took place.
   The U.S. has been pushing for talks with the Taliban outside the country. Special American representative
Marc Grossman is to meet Karzai January 21 to discuss progress and plans.
  Hizb-i-Islami is a radical Islamist militia that controls territory in Afghanistan's northeast. Its leader,
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, is a former U.S. ally now listed as a terrorist by Washington.
