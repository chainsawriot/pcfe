ANKARA (AP) - A news agency said the leaders of Turkey, Qatar and Syria will meet in Damascus to discuss the political
crisis in Lebanon after a Hezbollah-led coalition toppled the country's government. Anatolia news agency, citing Turkish
Foreign Ministry spokesman Selcuk Unal, said Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan will meet Qatar's Emir, Sheikh Hamad bin
Khalifa Al-Thani, and Syrian President Assad January 17. Turkish Foreign Minister Davutoglu, who is in Iraq, will also
travel to Syria for the meeting. Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Saad Hariri visited Turkey as part of efforts to rally
support after ministers allied to the Shiite militant group resigned, bringing down his government.
