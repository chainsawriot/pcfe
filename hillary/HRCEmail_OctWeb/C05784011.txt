Subject: France's Hollande formally anointed by Socialists (AP)


PARIS - (AP) France's Socialist Party has formally anointed Francois Hollande as its candidate for
presidential elections in six months, culminating a weeks-long process of primaries.
  The 57-year-old Hollande is expected to be the top rival to conservative President Nicolas Sarkozy _ who has
not yet declared his candidacy but is expected to do so.
  Socialist Party leader Martine Aubry told a party convention Saturday that "the change we want now has a
name, Francois Hollande."
  Hollande defeated Aubry by a large margin in an Oct. 16 vote for a Socialist candidate after three rounds of
debate.
  Among the five others defeated by Hollande was his former companion, Segolene Royal, mother of his four
children _ who challenged Sarkozy in 2005 elections.
