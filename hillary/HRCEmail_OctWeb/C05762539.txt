Not to pile on, but I wanted to reiterate to you what I said when we spoke by phone the other day about the Russia &
Pakistan trips.

Part of what Jake & I have been discussing as an important counter to the Ben Smith meme, is that we need to turn up
the volume on your activities relating to the five most pressing crises of the day (NK, ME, AfPkak, Iran, Iraq). Traveling
to Pakistan after India is an obvious opportunity.

I'll be putting something in writing in the coming days for you and the team to process, but I'm going to recommend that
we use the period from mid July, starting with the Big Speech, through the Asia trip, and finally the China S&ED here in
DC, as a 2-3 week window to *Relaunch* ourselves back onto the scene. Pakistan, with all that's happening, speaks to
the crises of the day like few other places do, and at the end of the day your travel speaks volumes to your work and
priorities.
