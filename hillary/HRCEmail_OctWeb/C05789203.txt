               The Secretary's Call Sheet for Senator Richard Lugar
                           Monday, February 13, 2012

 Purpose of Call: To ask Senator Lugar to include Julissa Reynoso's nomination
 in tomorrow's Senate Foreign Relations Committee business meeting.




 Background: Julissa Reynoso is our nominee to be U.S. Ambassador to Uruguay.
 She completed her confirmation hearing on February 7 alongside three other WHA
 nominees. H understood that she would be added to a February 14 business
 meeting, pending responses to all follow-up Questions for the Record (QFRs),
 which were promptly completed. However, Senator Lugar's staff on Friday
 blocked her inclusion due to his objection over what he sees as a lack of required
 focus on the U.S.-Uruguay trade relationship. That same day, Lugar sent
 additional QFRs, which the Department answered today. H has vigorously
 engaged Senator Lugar's staff on this issue, but the Committee has yet to include
 her nomination on the agenda for tomorrow's business meeting.
