Subject: Tunisia to propose peacekeeping force for Syria (AP)


   TUNIS (AP) - Tunisia's presidential spokesman says the North African country will propose a political
solution to the Syrian crisis involving a peacekeeping force.
   Adnan Mancer told The Associated Press Thursday in a TV interview that Tunisia would propose to the
"Friends of Syria" conference for a Yemen-style transition, where the president stepped down.
   Mancer says Tunisia is ready to take part in the peacekeeping force to back "a political solution because we
totally oppose a foreign military intervention."
   U.S., European and Arab foreign ministers are meeting Friday in Tunis to discuss solutions to the Syrian
crisis where thousands have died rebelling against the government.
   Participants are expected to call for humanitarian access to the hardest hit areas.
