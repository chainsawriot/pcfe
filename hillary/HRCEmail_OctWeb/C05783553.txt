Subject: Palestinian UN bid to Security Council faltering (AP)

UNITED NATIONS - (AP) The Palestinians they will consult Arab leaders and supporters and then decide
quickly whether to seek a vote in the Security Council on their bid for U.N. membership _ even though they
face certain defeat.
   The council's admissions committee approved a report saying there is no consensus among the 15 council
nations on the membership application.
   The report says the council is divided among those who support Palestinian membership, those who can't
support it now and therefore would abstain, and those who believe the application doesn't meet the criteria for
membership and oppose it.
   The Palestinians would need nine "yes" votes _ which the Palestinians don't appear to have _ and no veto by
a permanent member. The United States, Israel's closest ally, insists on a negotiated settlement of the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict and says it will use its veto power, if necessary.
