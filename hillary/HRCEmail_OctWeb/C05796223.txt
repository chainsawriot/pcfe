And here's the moment my midlife crisis kicked into full gear...



Philippe: "So do you know your assignment after graduation?"

Midshipman              "I'll be headed to Florida for a masters in ocean engineering."                                   B6

PIR: "Wow, is that in preparation for submarine service?"

        "Actually, it's in preparation for anti-submarine warfare school. I'm going to be a naval aviator."

PIR: "Like in a P-3 Orion?"

        "Those were retired. P-8's coming online"

PIR: "When dinner's over, I want to introduce you to Admiral Harris, who travels with the Secretary as the CJCS rep. He
was a P-3 navigator. In fact, he was serving up until the Hainan incident."

        nodding & smiling: "Yeah."

PIR: "You don't know what I'm talking about do you?"

           "No Sir, sorry. Never heard of it."

Here's the moment I knew we were from an entirely different world than what the midshipmen experience at
Annapolis, let alone where they're headed next...



Philippe, speaking to the dinner table, referring to Dorothy McAuliffe: "Not only is Dorothy the mother of a plebe, but
she and her husband Terry are close and old friends of the Clintons"

Midshipman                    "Oh wow, what does your husband do?"

Philippe: "The real question is, what DOESN'T Terry do?"

Dorothy: "ha ha ha... Well, for instance, he helped President Clinton build his library..."

Midshipman          "Oh, wow. So he's an architect?"                                                   B6
