Then we should preview what I will say later in some way and by saying I'm giving a shorter version because I have to go
to funeral.

There's zero new in it now.

I just read it and think it is predictable. What about Jose's memo's ideas? I'll work on it and try to make specific
suggestions.

Attached is the draft of the usglc speech that you would give tuesday if we could work out the time. Wanted you to
have a shot to read it tonite in case you have major comments. It's pretty straightforward - you'll see we signal two
econ speeches down the road (Hong Kong and the big one we discussed last week).
