I'm worried about the weather forecasts for thunderstorms. Can you pls check if I should leave earlier (or later?) to be

They can basically do whatever you'd like -- should we say 6:00pm?

Bill can't get home until late tomorrow so is there any chance I could either leave later or take a later shuttle?
