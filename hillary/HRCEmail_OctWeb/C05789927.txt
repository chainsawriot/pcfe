POLITICAL MALPRACTICE. WHY IS OBAMA TEAM ATTACKING GINGRICH?!?! WHY ARE THEY ACTING AS AN
ADJUNCT TO THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGNI'ml THEY SHOULD BE CALLING NEVVT "FORMIDABLE" AND POINTING
TO POLL SHOWING REPUBLICANS REGARD HIM AS MORE "ELECTABLE" THAN ROMNEY!!!* BUILD UP NEWT
WITHOUT EXCITING REPUBLICAN BASE VOTERS TO VOTE FOR ROMNEY. THE STRATEGY SHOULD BE TO LIFT
NEWT, UNDERMINE ROMNEY, ANYTHING TO PREVENT HIS NOMINATION, CREATE WEDGES WITHIN GOP
PRIMARY. WHY IS THE OBAMA TEAM HELPING ROMNEY TRY TO BRING DOWN NEVVTI21?!

*Rasmussen Reports survey, released Monday, showed that 49 percent of likely GOP primary voters now think Newt
Gingrich has the best chance of beating Obama, while only 24 percent say Romney has the best shot.
        AXELROD AND THE 'MONKEY BUTT.' ABC's Devin Dwyer reports: Newt GingrichA has joked that God
        wanted him to be a bear, not a gazelle. But President Obama's chief campaign strategistA David
        AxelrodA today said Gingrich is more like a monkey. Speaking at a WashingtonA press briefing, Axelrod
        said the former House speaker's climb to the top of the pack will further expose his least flattering
        personal and professional qualities. "Just remember, the higher a monkey climbs on a pole, the more you
        can see his butt," Axelrod said, citing a piece of political wisdom he said he learned from a Chicago
        alderman. "So, the speaker is very high on the pole right now and we'll see how people like the view."
        Axelrod chided Gingrich as an "extremist" whose role in the partisan fights of the 1990s helped lead to
        government shutdowns and the impeachment of President Bill Clinton.A "His penchant for provocation is
        not going to help him deal with the shortfalls that he has right now among women, among seniors and
        some other key constituencies," he added. http://abcn.ws/tF1IxX

After spending much of the primary season lying low, Mitt Romney is in the
midst of an all-out media blitz this week as his campaign attempts to stem rival
Newt Gingrich's rise.
His uneven debate performance four days ago helped solidify the campaign's
new strategy, which puts Romney front and center in television, radio and
newspaper interviews like his sit-down with the Washington Post yesterday in
which he called Gingrich an "extraordinarily unreliable leader in the
conservative world."
"Even during the campaign, the number of times he has moved from one spot to
another has been remarkable," Romney told the Post's Dan Balz and Phil
Rucker. "I think he's shown a level of unreliability as a conservative leader
today." http://wapo.st/rPhRvs
Romney has been blanketing Fox News with interviews every day this week,
culminating with his appearance on "Fox News Sunday" this weekend - his first
appearance on a Sunday news show since March 2010.
It's a far cry from late summer when Politico's Ben Smith characterized
Romney's approach to the presidential campaign as "the Mittness Protection
Program" - a period when Romney held few public appearances and
participated in even fewer media interviews. http://politi.co/r98t9Y
Not only has Romney launched himself into public view this week, his
campaign has also taken the gloves off when it comes to Gingrich. A case-in-.
point: Team Romney is out with a new web video this morning titled "Newt And
Nancy," reminding voters about the global warming ad the former House
Speaker and Nancy Pelosi filmed together a few years ago. http://bit.ly/tkiflY
"Filming an ad with Nancy Pelosi is another example of Newt Gingrich being an
unreliable conservative and an unreliable leader," according to a statement
from the Romney campaign accompanying the clip.
The reason for the new strategy is obvious: Almost every poll, including the
ones in early primary states, show Gingrich in the lead, including an NBC
News-Wall Street Journal poll that put Gingrich at 40 percent nationally among
GOP primary voters compared to 23 percent for Romney.
However, Romney insiders have been telling the Note this week to look for
signs that Gingrich is starting to slip, and we've got one this morning. A fresh
Gallup tracking poll shows Gingrich's lead over Romney decreasing from 15
percentage points (37 percent to 22 percent) to 9 percentage points (31 percent
to 22 percent). http://bit.ly/rMyOZG

presidency in the latestA ABC News/Washington Post poll,A but he's still more
popular than his front-running potential Republican challenger, Newt Gingrich
And then there are views of the economy, which make both look almost good by
comparison. Forty-nine percent of Americans now express an unfavorable
opinion of Obama, while 48 percent view him favorably - the first time his
negative number has exceeded his positive one in this most basic measure of
personal popularity." http://abcn.ws/tUlUg
AND GINGRICHaC1 "Gingrich is further underwater, with an unfavorable
rating that's essentially the same as Obama's - 48 percent - but a favorable score
that's 13 points lower, 35 percent. (More are undecided about Gingrich than
about the president.) Moreover, while just 23 percent see Obama "strongly"
favorably, Gingrich's core group of strong supporters is just half as large, 12
percent." http://abcn.ws/tUlUg

MIKE HUCKABEE PREMIERES ANTI-ABORTION DOCUMENTARY
IN IOWA. "Former GOP presidential candidate and Arkansas Gov.
Mike Huckabee has been a vocal opponent of abortion. So it's no
surprise that the ordained Southern Baptist minister has joined
forces with conservative non-profit group Citizens United to
produce and today host the premiere in Des Moines, Iowa, of a new
anti-abortion documentary, 'The Gift of Life,'" ABC's Calvin
Lawrence reports. "The independent film 'explores the sanctity of
life as a moral issue and looks at the lives of individuals who were
nearly the victims of an abortion,' according to its website."
THE BUZZ
GINGRICH IOWA STAFFER FIRED OVER MORMON 'CULT'
COMMENT. "A member of Newt Gingrich's campaign staff in Iowa
was asked to resign Tuesday after disparaging comments he had
made about Mitt Romney surfaced," ABC's Elicia Dover reports.
"Craig Bergman, the political director for Newt 2012 in Iowa said
last Wednesday that some pastors are on the 'anti-Mitt Romney
bandwagon."A lot of the evangelicals believe God would give us four
more years of Obama just for the opportunity to expose the cult of
Mormon. There's a thousand pastors ready to do that,' Bergman said
last week to a Republican focus group. In the same focus group
Bergman also was critical of Gingrich, calling him the 'smartest
unwise man in America.' According to the The Iowa Republican, the
organization that hosted the focus group, Bergman was worried
about backing Gingrich after incidents such as the GOP
frontrunner's appearance alongside fellow former Speaker of the
