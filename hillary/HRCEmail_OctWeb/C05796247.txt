Dear Tam--

Hooray! I am so happy and proud for you and for our country that you are now a citizen. I hope you and Julie come by to
see me so I can congratulate you in person. I'm copying Lona so she can start looking for a time.

Congratulations, my friend. H

Dear Hillary--

I wanted to share with you that I was naturalized and took the citizenship oath this morning at the US District
Court in DC. The oath was administered by Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly. I am so overjoyed and can barely
contain myself. Thank you for everything - I am incredibly grateful to you and countless other
friends who supported and believed in me.

Attached are a few pictures from today. Julie was at my side, as was my boss, friend and mentor Senate
Sergeant-At-Arms Terry Gainer, Kate Beale and Jon Cardinal.

Talk to you soon and best wishes from a new and very proud American!

Tam
