Thanks for telling me and I hope Henry's comments will be shared w Kati and the family. I'm speaking on Friday in Berlin
at their remembrance w Kati and others. At the end of the month, Charlie Rose is interviewing Henry and me on the 8th
floor as part of our efforts to raise $ for the Dip Rooms endowment. So this is good to know. I'd like to know what else
Henry said so I'm prepared for the interview. Where was the mtg? Are you now back? Will I see you on Tues night at
your big dinner?

Subject: a grace note

Henry Kissinger just ended the Afpak panel at the Trilateral Commission this morning with a quite lovely extemp eulogy
to RCH -- "a great idealist who will be admired and loved and who would have made a tremendous contribution on
[Afpak] had fate allowed him to continue.... We should ask our Chairman to write a letter to his wife expressing the pride
and gratitude we all feel for his service."
