Friends:

Today I read about Ray LaHood's son and his ordeal in Egypt and it reminds me of the anxiety and fear that I felt a year
ago while I was there when the Egyptian uprising started. I witnessed demonstrations, clashes with the police,
explosions, gunfire, police walking off their jobs, vigilantism, mass arrests and other chaotic events that accompany
major revolutions. The Arab Spring was unfolding before my eyes. It was reminiscent of the civil rights demonstrations
of my childhood â€” exhilarating and scary at the same time.

I so appreciate the extraordinary efforts by my friends in government and in the private sector who worked to get me,
my sister and all U.S. travelers out of Egypt safely.

Thank you again. I will never forget your assistance and for the work that you do every day to make democracy a reality
at home and abroad.

I am praying for Sam LaHood and his colleagues.

Laura
