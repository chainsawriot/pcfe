Subject: Hezbollah prisoner held by Iraq faces minor charge (AP)

BAGHDAD (AP) -       Iraqi officials say a Lebanese Hezbollah commander allegedly responsible for killing four
U.S. soldiers will be prosecuted for illegal entry with a forged passport.
   Ali Musa Daqduq was the last American prisoner in Iraq and was handed over to Iraqi authorities on Friday.
   On Saturday, two Iraqi officials said Daqduq will be prosecuted for illegal entry with a forged passport _ the
only Iraqi charge against him. But the officials say an investigative judge will consider U.S. allegations against
him. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
   Daqduq has been linked to a brazen raid in which four American soldiers were abducted and killed in the
Iraqi holy city of Karbala in 2007.
