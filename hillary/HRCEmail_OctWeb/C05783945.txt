Subject: Draft Talking Point - Global Fund and France

Cheryl —

We understand that the French Foreign Minister is speaking with S tomorrow morning, and he is expected to
raise the Global Fund. We are preparing to submit the following point for S briefing book, but Eric and I
wanted to be sure you were comfortable:


Key Point If Asked About the Global Fund

                                                                                           We need to move
together quickly to make ensure that the Fund has the right leadership and management to successfully
implement its reform agenda and continue its vital work of saving lives at this critical time.

Background

The High Level Panel which examined the Global Fund's fiduciary controls, as well as other internal reviews,
have heavily criticized the Executive Director (a French National, championed by President Sarkozy) for weak
management of Secretariat operations, a fractured relationship with the Fund's Inspector General and
insufficient attention to oversight of funds. The U.S. position is that the Fund needs an outstanding
management team in place to implement the necessary reforms that USG and others have championed.
                                                                                    We believe the Executive
Director must be replaced expeditiously and honorably, with no more than a six-month transition during which
a Board-appointed turnaround team would provide core management of the Fund.

                                                               We need a Board consensus for action, and the Board
is meeting on November 21-22.




Thanks
