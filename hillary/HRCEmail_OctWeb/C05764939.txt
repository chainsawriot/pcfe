Talked to Mike and delivered the message, adding somalia to the other immediate operational challenges. Went into
some length about not being able to be responsible for civilian deployments if there is any ambiguity about relationship
btwn State and USAID. His reaction was to ask whether we should consider folding AID into State. I said we were
proceding with the understanding that we all had when we signed on that a big part of our responsibility is to oversee
policy and manage resources for both USAID and State. I said that I recognized that Gail has a history of believing in an
independent AID, to which he responded that is not the basis of this exercise, but he did not challenge the
characterization of past views. I made it clear that our suggestion on coordination was not intended to deny resources
to the PSD process but to avoid the unintended consequence of sending a signal to AID that will make an already hard
set of challenges impossible. He said he would think through and get back to us.
