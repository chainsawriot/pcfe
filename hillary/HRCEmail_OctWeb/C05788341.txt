Subject: Pakistan PM won't retract criticism of military (Reuters)


ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's prime minister on Sunday rejected a demand by the country's powerful
army chief that he clarify or retract his criticism of the army and the spy agency last week, likely raising
tensions further.

  "The prime minister... is answerable to parliament," Yusuf Raza Gilani told reporters in the central city of
Vehari. "I will not answer to a person. I am answerable to parliament."

   Gilani criticized Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani and the director general of the Inter-Services
Intelligence agency Lieutenant-General Ahmed Shuja Pasha for filing court papers in a case involving a
mysterious memo that has pitted the military against the civilian government.
