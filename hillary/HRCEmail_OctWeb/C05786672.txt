Dear Hillary:

I hope all is well personally. It's a torrid political situation for the Administration. Progressives are not in a good position
on debts and deficits anywhere; or not in a good political position, as we have some good arguments.




I have been doing some writing and speaking about ten years since 9/11. Perhaps one of your staff can get a piece I
wrote for London based Prospect magazine just published, entitled "Decade of Disorder".

Further to our last conversation, in the Autumn I am taking up the cause of youth unemployment, and will be chairing a
short (hopefully sweet) blue-ribbon panel on the lost promise to young workers. But there is very little space in formal
UK politics; parties can't have two leaders.

I have a couple of big decisions to take and it would be good if we could catch up when I am in DC 26-28 September (I
am contributing to a Post conference on China at which I think your husband is interviewing Henry Kissinger). I will ask
my office to contact yours but perhaps you could register the dates with your team.

Hope you get a break. Despite Assad and other problems I still think Arab Spring will work out. I am very concerned
about Af-Pak and MEPP as they two great insolubles. As for EU it is not an advert for anything at the moment. The bond
markets are capricious and unaccountable but they do capture truths about political uncertainty.

Best,

David
