Cheryl,

        Please thank the Secretary for her speech on economic statecraft. The topic is in many
respects our Achilles heel, and it has been a struggle to refocus my Political Section to engage
seriously on trade, economic, and commercial matters. In both of my countries of accreditation,
economic priorities are now strongly driving diplomatic activity, and we sow the seeds of our own
irrelevance if we don't tack into that reality aggressively.

       Thanks again.

       - D

P/E colleagues:

        If you haven't already done so, please view or read this week the Secretary's speech on
economic statecraft, found at http://video.state.gov/en/tor)-
stories/video/1218722127001/economic-statecraft/s-creationDate/0-1/?0 . It is an important
articulation of strategy and priorities sometimes under-attended in traditional DOS deployment.

        The speech confirms the wisdom of our efforts here to increase commercial diplomacy
activity, integrate economic/commercial staff from different agencies into one team, and begin
evaluating ourselves - including in the formal officer performance review process - according to how
well these priorities are advanced. As you know, Goals No. 1 & 3 of the Mission New Zealand MSRP
and Goal No. 2 of the Mission Samoa MSRP articulate this subject matter as a top priority.


Michele / Peter:

       In the speech, the Secretary mentions sending out updated instructions on economic
statecraft. If we have not already received that document, could you obtain a copy for us.

      Thanks much.

      - D
