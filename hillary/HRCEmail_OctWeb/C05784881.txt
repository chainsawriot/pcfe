              Thinking About Anti-Semitism in Europe

     "Conference on Fighting Anti-Semitism in Europe:
                                   What is Next?"

  Mr.



         I am delighted and honored to
  get a chance both to meet all of
  you and to share some thoughts
  on the issue of anti-Semitism
  today in Europe.

         First, a couple of apologies.
  When I was asked to speak, I

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015




  did not realize that I would be
 slated to do an "Opening" or
 "Welcome." And the topic today
 is too important to daily too long
 with welcomes.

        So welcome. If you are new
  to Belgium, the frites, chocolate,
 beer and mussels are terrific
 and have only the oval waffles
 called Liege waffles, put no
  toppings on them, and get them
 straight from the waffle iron.

         OK. So much for welcomes.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015




         The second apology is an
  apology in advance for my not
  saying what you would expect
  me to say. You see, the
  temptation always exists at
 conferences discussing
 perceived biases, prejudices,
 discrimination and even hatred,
 to cite a couple of anecdotal
 instances of violence or hatred,
 sound an alarm, rally a
 response, take the applause and
 sit down.

        But to me, the issues are too
 complex and too much in flux to

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015




  simply take the easy path. This
  topic is too important and the
  time of each of you is too
  valuable to simply use this
  meeting as a group opportunity
  to decry hatred. Of course, we
  and all well-meaning among the
  brotherhood of man must decry
  hatred. But that is just the
  starting point, not the end of the
  discussion.

         So I likely will not just say
  fully what you expected and or
  maybe hoped to hear. I respect
  all of you too much to do that.

         But let's start with some
  context. Who am I and from
  what background do I approach
  these issues?

    My story is not that atypical
 for the United States - it is in
 fact right at the core of the
 American dream. My father,
 Gitman Mogilnicki, grew up in a
 Polish town of Biala Rawska. As
 the Germans began to pressure
 the Poles, he left the town to try
 to join the Resistance. Having
 been rejected by the Resistance
 for looking too Jewish and
 having been gone but a week,


UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015




 he returned to find that the
 Jewish section of the town no
 longer existed. He spent the war
 with a few other escapees in the
 woods, never being caught,
 sleeping in dug out graves to
 avoid the bullets when the
 Germans fired along the ground,
 and stealing food in the middle
 of the night by risking missions
 to town.

         He often wondered
 whether any from the town of
 Biala Rawska had been taken to
 camps rather than just having
 been slaughtered on the spot.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015




  But having spent the years after
  the war searching in vain for
  even one surviv r, he finally
  concluded that had the town
  been taken to camps rather than
  being killed then and there,
  sur ly one person would have
  survived. There was simply no
   ne left.

          Having searched in vain
  for of survivors and
   mployment in Warsaw and
   erlin until 1951, he decided to
     me to the United States and
   t   a â€¢ ain. ut the United
   takes ads uotas limiting the

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015




  number of immigrants from
  Poland. So my father arranged
  illegally to purchase a false
 passport in which he transposed
 his first and last names, and
 Gitman Mogilnicki of Biala
 Rawska Poland became Mosher
 Gutman first of Danzig and then
 Max Gutman of the Bronx, New
 York, and the garment district in
 the lower East Side of
 Manhattan.
    Carrying forward with the
 next-generation-make-good
 story, I attended public schools.
 My father died when I was 16,
 never having discussed the war

  with me and never having told
  me even his real name. Upon his
  death, I went to work after
  school cleaning tables in a
  restaurant and through the
  student loan program, I
  attended Columbia University
  and then Harvard Law School.
  Having finished among the top
  of my class, I then clerked on
  our highest court, the United
  States Supreme Court, an honor
  given to the top roughly 40 law
  school graduates a year, I spent
  two years as a pecial Assistant
  to the Director of the FBI for
  counterintelligence and counter=

  terrorism, and 27 years as a
 lawyer at a leading law firm and
 as an advisor to government
 officials and Democratic
 political candidates for office. I
 was on the Board of the
 Washington Hebrew Home for
 seniors and a member of two
 different shuts in Washington DC
   a reform shut and an Orthodox
 shut.
         During the Presidential
 campaign of Barack Obama,
 participated in a lot of activities
 including policy, speechwork,
 press, fundraising and more.
 One of my efforts was working

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015




  with the Jewish vote. Though
  there was much support in the
  Jewish community during the
  campaign, I combated
  significant suspicion and
  concern among the Jewish
  community as to whether a
  black man named Barack
  Hussein Obama could really be a
  good friend for Israel and the
  Jewish community.
     And since I have come to
  Belgium, I have made my story
  well known and it has been well
  received by all. I have engaged
  at great lengths with the Jewish
  communities, giving speeches in

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015




  Flanders, Brussels and Wallonia
  and even before the World
  Jewish Congress on Barack
  Obama's relationship with the
  Jewish community and the
  Middle East. The speech, which
  argues that by becoming
  credible in the Arab world,
  President Obama has become
  Israel's best and most valuable
  friend, is on our website and is
  available to any who are
  interested. And I appear
  regularly at Jewish community
  events such as memorials,
  tributes and celebrations.

     I have engaged at great
  length as well with Muslim
  communities. I have done
  significant outreach with the
  largely Moroccan and Turkish
  communities throughout
  Belgium -- in Molenbeeck, in
  Anderlecht, in Hasselt and many
  other areas. Today alone, I met
  with leaders of a Flemish
  nationalist party to discuss the
  Israeli-Palestinian problem and
  the effect on the U.S. position
  with regard to UNESCO and
  other U.N. organizations, and
  with the largest mosque in
  Belgium to talk about the same

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015




 topic and East-West relations. I
 host at my Residence an annual
 Mar, last September sharing
 dinner in my ballroom with 180
 leaders of the Muslim
 communities. I have available
 in fact copies of a column that
 was written two years ago by
 the former Mayor of
 Jeddah,Saudi Arabia, who was
 then the Saudi Ambassador to
 Belgium, talking about the
 advances of the Obama
 administration in East-West
 relationships following his
 participation at one of our Iftars.

     And I follow closely and think
  often about issues of anti-
  Semitism in Europe. In the past
  few months, Jacques Brotchi, a
  Federal Senator and leading
  neurosurgeon, quit his affiliation
  with a Brussels university over
  issues of anti-Semitism and we
  are in the process of following
  up on those developments. We
  have been following up since
  last week when a Jewish female
  student was beaten up at a
  Belgian school by other
  students spewing racial
  epithets.



UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015




         To some extent, I have unique
  exposure to these issues. And
  such exposure has left me
  convinced how complicated and
  changing this issue is.
  Generalizations about anti-
  Semitism in Europe are
  dangerous i deed - always at
  risk of oversimplifying and of
  lumping together diverse
  phenomena.
     So let's start the analysis
  with the clearest and easiest
  departure p o int. There is and
  has long been some amount of
  anti-Semitism, if hatred and
  violence against Jews, from a

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015




  small sector of the population
  who hate others who may be
  different or perceived to be
  different, largely for the sake of
  hating. Those anti-Semites are
  people who hate not only Jews,
  but Muslims, gays, gypsies, and
  likely any who can be described
  as minorities or different. That
  hatred is of course pernicious
  and it must be combated. We
  can never take our eye off it or
  just dismiss it as fringe
  elements or the work of crazy
  people, because we have seen
  in the past how it can foment
  and grow. And it is that hatred


UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015




  that lawyers like you can work
  vigilantly to expose, combat and
  punish, maybe in conjunction
  with existing human rights
  groups.
     I have not personally seen
  much of that hatred in Europe,
  though it rears its ugly head
  from time to time. I do not have
  any basis to think it is growing
  in any sense. But of course, we
  can never take our eye off of it,
  and you particularly as lawyers
  can help with that process.
    So in some sense, .that is the
  easy part of the analysis.


UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015




    Let's turn to the harder and
  more complex part.
    What I do see as growing, as
 gaining much more attention in
 the newspapers and among
 politicians and communities, is
 a different phenomena. It is the
 phenomena that led Jacques
 Brotchi to quit his position on
 the university committee a
 couple of months ago and that
 led to the massive attention last
 week when the Jewish female
 student was beaten up. It is the
 problem within Europe of
 tension, hatred and sometimes
 even violence between some

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015




 members of Muslim
 communities or Arab immigrant
 groups and Jews. It is a tension
 and perhaps hatred largely born
 of and reflecting the tension
 between Israel, the Palestinian
 Territories and neighboring Arab
 states in the Middle East over
 the continuing Israeli-
 Palestinian problem.
    It too is a serious problem. It
 too must be discussed and
 solutions explored. No Jewish
 student - and no Muslim student
 or student of any heritage or
 religion - should ever feel
 intimidated on a University

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015




 campus for their heritage or
 religion leading to academic
 leaders quitting in protest. No
 high school or grammar school
 Jewish student - and no Muslim
 high school or grammar school
 student or student of any
 heritage or religion - should be
 beaten up over their heritage or
 religion.
    But this second problem is in
 my opinion different in many
 respects than t e classic
 bigotry - hatred against those
 who are different and against
 minorities generally the type
 of anti-Semitism that I

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015




 discussed above. It is more
 complex and requiring much
 more thought and analysis. This
 second form of what is labeled
 "growing anti-Semitism"
 produces strange phenomena
 and results.
    Thus for example, I have been
 received well by Belgians
 everywhere in this country. I
 always get polite applause and
 sometimes more.
   But the longest and loudest
 ovation I have ever received in
 Belgium came from the high
 school with one of the largest
 percentages of students of Arab

  heritage. It was in Molenbeek.
 It consisted of an audience
 dominated by girls with head
 scarves and boys named
 Mohammed, standing and
 cheering boisterously for a
 Jewish American, who belongs
 to two schuls and whose father
 was a Holocaust survivor. Let
 me just share a minute or two
 with you of a video clip from
 that visit.
    These kids were not anti-
 Semitic as I have ever thought
 of the term. And I get a similar
 reaction as I engage with imans,
 at Mars, and with Muslims

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015




  communities throughout
  Belgium.
     And yet, I know and I hear at
  the same time that the cheering
  occurs for this Jew, that within
  that same school and audience
  at Molenbeek, among those at                                ,




  the same Mars, and throughout
  the Muslim communities that I
  visit, and indeed throughout
  Europe, there is significant
  anger and resentment and, yes,
  perhaps sometimes hatred and
  indeed sometimes and all too
  growing intimidation and
  violence directed at Jews
  generally as a result of the

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015




  continuing tensions between
  Israel and the Palestinian
  territories and other Arab
  neighbors in the Middle East.
   This is a complex problem
 indeed. It requires its own
 analysis and solutions. And the
 analysis I submit is not served
 simply by lumping the problem
 with past instances of anti-
 Jewish beliefs and actions or
 those that exist today among
 minority haters under a uniform
 banner of "anti-Semitism."
   It is I believe this area where
 community leaders - Jewish,
 Muslim, and third parties where
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015




  diplomats and religious leaders,
  where lawyers and professionals
  from both communities, where
  mothers and fathers, where
 university leaders and school
 administrators, can make the
 most difference by working to
 limit converting political and
 military tension in the Middle
 East into social problems in
 Europe. But it is the area too -
 both fortunately and
 unfortunately where the
 largest part of the solution
 remains in the hands of
 government leaders in Israel
 and the Palestinian territories

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015




  and Arab countries in the Middle
  East. It is the area where every
  new settlement announced in
  Israel, every rocket shot over a
  border or suicide bomber on a
  bus, and every retaliatory
  military strike exacerbates the
  problem and provides a setback
  here in Europe for those fighting
  hatred and bigotry here in
  Europe.


     I said that it is both fortunate
  and unfortunate that the largest
  part of the solution for this
  second type of problem - too
  often lumped under a general

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015




  banner of anti-Semitism is in
  the hands of Israel, the
  Palestinians and Arab neighbors
  in the Middle East. It is
  fortunate because it means that,
  unlike traditional hatred of
  minorities, a path towards
  improving and resolving it does
  at least exist. It is crucial for
  the Middle East - but it is crucial
  for the Jewish and Arab
  communities in Europe and for
  countries around the globe
  that Mid-East peace
  negotiations continue, that
  settlements abate, and that
  progress towards a lasting

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015




  peace be made and then such a
  peace reached in the Middle
  East. Were a lasting peace in
  the Middle East to be reached,
  were joint and cooperative
  Israeli-Arab attentions turned to
  focus instead on such serious,
  common threats such as Iran,
  this second type of ethnic
  tension and bigotry here in
  Europe - which is clearly
  growing today - would clearly
  abate. I can envision the day
  when it disappears. Peace in
  the Middle East would indeed
  equate with a huge reduction of

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05784881 Date: 10/30/2015




  this form of labeled "anti-
  Semitism" here in Europe.
         It is at the same time
  somewhat unfortunate that most
  of the cause and thus most of
  the solution for tension and
  hatred in Europe, for growing
  problems at Belgian universities,
  for epithets in the streets, rest
  with governments and people a
  continent away. For, in some
  respect, citizens, parents,
  religious and community leaders
  here in Europe can simply try to
  promote understanding and
  patience, while ensuring law
  enforcement serves its mission,

  without being able fully to
  address the most root causes
  and most efficient cures.
    It is a challenge for us all. I
 hope it is one you will address in
 this conference.
   Thanks so much and all the
 best.
