Subject: RE: Public Afghanistan Strategy

The approach we took was to integrate our emphasis on women throughout the strategy, vice indicating that it was a
separate effort. All of our programs benefit women, usually be specific design. Below are a few places under education,
health and judicial access where women's issues are highlighted in the strategy. We are completely open to how best to
address this.

"Improving education opportunities for all Afghans, regardless of gender, is a top
priority....It is necessary for diminishing the influence of extremists...and improving
Afghanistan's long-term economic potential."

"We are increasing capacity and reducing corruption in the courts...and also including
training on women's rights and the laws that protect women."

"We will dedicate additional resources to improving Afghans' access to formal justice.. .with
an emphasis on legal aid, gender, and juvenile justice issues."

"Since 2001, significant improvements have been made in the availability of basic health
services...and ensuring educational opportunities for all Afghans, regardless of gender. We
will sustain our efforts to build the Afghan government's health and education systems."

In Pakistan, "governance programs will build local government capacity in vulnerable districts, support civil
society including for women and minorities."

Yes, it is accurate. Unless I am badly mistaken, the report does not have a separate section on women.

The real issue is â€” is it accurate that the strategy does not have a section regarding women, which would seem almost
impossible.

     We have no record of having received the letter and have not been able to find a copy, but I understand
that Miguel Rodriguez in H is trying to run it down through Ann Norris on Senator Boxer's staff. Dan

Barbara Boxer apparently sent a letter to saying there is nothing about women in the Afghan strategy. There
is nothing in the table of contents.

Is this accurate? Seems odd given that I know that AMS had flagged this and I WI Jake you had.

Can you advise.
