Subject: Amb. Terzi
Importance: High

I called Amb. Terzi to congratulate him on his new position of Foreign Minister. He was called by
President Napolitano at 3 am this morning and is leaving for Rome this afternobn at 3. He was
concerned that because he is leaving so quickly, he is not able to comply with the normal protocol
requirements for a departing Ambassador. He asked me to convey to the Secretary and to the Chief
of Protocol his regret that he was not able to say his good-byes properly, but also wanted us to know
that the fact that he was chosen to replace Frattini as FM is an indication, of the importance the
Government of Italy places on its relationship with Washington. He also noted that he hoped to
return to Washington in his new capacity soon in order to meet with the Secretary.

I said I would pass the message to my colleagues in EUR, and he also asked that we convey it to the
NSS so over to EUR for that part.
