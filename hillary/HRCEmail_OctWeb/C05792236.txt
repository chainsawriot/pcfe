Subject:                          Branson



We just received word from Branson's office that he enthusiastically accepts your invitation to speak at the Impact
Economy Forum on April 26th. He would prefer a back and forth intervw session on stage (with a moderator to be
named) rather than giving a speech). He would also like to spend some time with you at lunch as you had suggested.


We are very excited about the prospect.


Many thanks


Kris
