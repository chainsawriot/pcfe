SENSITIVE

Gentlemen,

Before the end of the day I will send you the latest working version of Jack's trip to IIAP&B. We depart here late
Tuesday, Sept 1 and return Thurs, Sept 10.

Rough version of places and people is:

Sept 2-3       Iraq
Lew, Verma, Campbell, Elisa Slotkin (NEA), possibly Paul Jones (SRAP) and/or David Robinson (PRM)

Sept 4-5       India
Lew, Verma, Campbell, Paul Jones and Sean Misko (SRAP), possibly David Robinson (PRM)

Sept 6-7       Pakistan
Lew, Verma, Campbell, Paul Jones and Sean Misko (SRAP), possibly David Robinson (PRM)

Sept 8-9       Afghanistan
Lew, Verma, Campbell, Paul Jones and Sean Misko (SRAP), possibly David Robinson (PRM)
Hooking up with Acting AID Administration Alonzo Fulgham for a portion of the trip

Sept 10           Brussels (am)
                   Washington (pm)



As discussed very briefly with PJ and Ian this am., Jack floated the idea of having a journalist accompany
us. Alternatively, we are very focused on both international and local journalists, esp in India and Af/Pak.

Not planning to do media in Iraq or Brussels.

Very open to doing something in advance of trip (though hard to squeeze in Mon/Tues) and upon return.

Piper
