DUBAI (Reuters) - Dozens of pro-government demonstrators marched to the offices of a Bahraini opposition
party on Saturday and daubed the building with grafitti against majority Shi'ites and Iran, residents said. '

   They said "Down with Iran" and "Shi'ites get out" were among the slogans written on the offices of Waad, a
secular party aligned with the largest Shi'ite opposition group Wefaq which was at the forefront of protests
against the Sunni-led government this year.

   U.S.-allied Bahrain has accused Shi'ite power Iran of instigating unrest among Shi'ites in the Gulf Arab
kingdom, an allegation Tehran denies.

  "Police stopped them from entering. They dispersed after leaving pictures of King Hamad and the prime
minister outside the Waad headquarters," a resident said.

   "This building had been burned down twice, and we had just repaired it. So we were afraid that may be
repeated. But police were there and nothing happened," Radhi al-Musawi, Waad's deputy secretary-general, told
Reuters by telephone.
