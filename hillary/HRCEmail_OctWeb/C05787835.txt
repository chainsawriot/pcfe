Subject: Qatar says Syria protocol not being implemented (Reuters)



CAIRO (Reuters) - Syria  is not implementing a deal with the Arab League aimed at halting violence in the
country, the prime minister of Qatar said on Friday, adding that Arab League monitors could not stay there to
"waste time".

   The Syrian army, required to pull of Syrian cities according to the deal, had not withdrawn, Sheikh Hamad
bin Jassim al-Thani said. He added there had been no end to killing during the 10 days spent in Syria by the
Arab monitors.

    "With great regret, the news is not good," Sheikh Hamad told Al Jazeera television.

   An Arab League committee is due on Sunday to discuss an initial report by the Arab observers who are
checking Syria's compliance with the plan to halt President Bashar al-Assad's crackdown on nearly 10 months
of unrest.

  "We will listen to the report of the mission and then the Arab committee which will decide what we will do,"
Sheikh Hamad said. "We cannot be there to waste time while the killing is continuing," he added.

   The monitors began work on the streets on Dec. 26 to try to verify whether the government was keeping its
promise to pull troops and tanks out of cities and free thousands of detainees.

  Sheikh Hamad said the observers had been sent after Syria had signed the protocol to monitor
implementation. "Unfortunately, nothing has been implemented," he said.
