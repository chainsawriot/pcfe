I think the PM of Turkey is coming Dec 7. Have we been asked to do anything for him? I want to be sure we treat him
and his party well. If WH doesn't do lunch, should we?

                                                 Have you been told what time yet?

Pls keep Dec 1, 2 and 3 free and plan for me to go to Brussels either night of 12/2 or 3.

Also, which shuttles have you held for Wed?
