FYI. I would note, as I did to Marc, that these guys often think K is "softening his position." Turns out his position is
remarkably consistent, and the Hekmatyar interview will only reinforce it.

Just spoke to him. Reviewed S's three questions from yesterday.

He had just returned from a meeting with DefMin Warak and DFonMin Ludin.
They say K "softening" his position on detentions. Ryan will take S thru his thinking on detentions.

Ryan has been asked to see K at 1700 Kabul time Monday. Ryan assumes it is about the Ulema statement on which Ryan
continues to be hard in private but not/not in public.
