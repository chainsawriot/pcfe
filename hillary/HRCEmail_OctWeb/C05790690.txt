Subject: Australia's Rudd challenges PM for leadership (AP)


SYDNEY (AP) - Australia's former Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd has announced that he will challenge Prime
Minister Julia Gillard for leadership of their party and the country.
   Gillard is planning a leadership ballot for Monday. The vote by party lawmakers is an effort by Gillard to
knock down a power struggle that has been percolating for weeks. Rudd resigned as foreign minister during a
trip to the U.S. earlier this week.
   Rudd announced his intentions to challenge Gillard in a speech Friday.
