 Purpose of Call: To request that Brazil: (1) support a "politically binding"
 agreement in Copenhagen; (2) agree to inscribe their robust domestic actions in
 this agreement; and (3) to submit their actions to international review.

 • Copenhagen Accord on Climate Change: The White House just announced
   that, in the context of an overall deal in Copenhagen, the President is prepared
   to put forward a U.S. emissions reduction target in the range of 17 percent
   below 2005 levels in 2020, in line with final U.S. legislation.

 • Danish PM Rasmussen has proposed a "politically binding" operational
   agreement that would cover all the main issues. We support this proposal, and
   we hope you will too. It is not a substitute for a legal agreement, but will
   advance such an agreement. The alternative — to call for negotiations to
   continue, recognizing that we have not finished — would be viewed as a failure.

 • We welcome the strong statements and commitments Brazil has made,
   including your announcements on forests and overall climate mitigation. It will
   be critical that you incorporate your policies and goals in the Copenhagen
   Accord and allow these actions to be internationally reviewed.

 • Brazil has taken a leadership role in these negotiations and we hope you will
   continue to push other countries, including other major developing economies,
   toward a successful outcome. It will be very important for China to put forward
   robust actions beyond business-as-usual that are subject to international review.
