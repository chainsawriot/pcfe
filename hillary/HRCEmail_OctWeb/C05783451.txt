Subject: Arab League confirms Syria's suspension from group (AP)



RABAT (AP) - Foreign ministers from the 22-member Arab League have confirmed Syria's suspension from
the organization because of its bloody suppression of anti-government protests.
  The foreign ministers also gave the Syrian government three days to respond to an Arab peace/plan that
involves sending an Arab League delegation to monitor compliance.
   The ministers announced their decisions in a statement after an emergency meeting Wednesday in Rabat,
Morocco.
   The suspension _ first announced Saturday and upheld during the meeting _ is a surprisingly harsh and highly
unusual move for a member of Syria's standing.
