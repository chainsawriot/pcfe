Subject: Iran: IAEA chief threatens Iranian lives (AP)


VIENNA (AP) - A senior Iranian envoy is accusing the head of the U.N. nuclear body of security leaks that
expose his country's scientists and their families to the threat of assassination by the U.S. and Israel.
  Ali Asghar Soltanieh says the leaks by International Atomic Energy Agency chief Yukiya Amano in a recent
report have made Iranian scientists "the targets for assassination by ... (the) Israeli regime and United State(s) of
America intelligence services."
  The accusations reflect Iran's fury with Amano over the report to the IAEA board detailing Tehran's alleged
secret research and development of nuclear weapons.
  Soltanieh, Iran's chief IAEA delegate, shared his letter with reporters Friday.
  He said Amano is to blame for any threat "against the lives of my fellow citizens."
