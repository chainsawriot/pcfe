Disaster Declaration: El Salvador — Flooding
November 10, 2009

Since early November heavy, constant rain has fallen in El Salvador as an indirect effect of tropical depressions
and Hurricane Ida. Heaviest accumulations occurred on November 7. According to the U.S. Embassy in San
Salvador, the Government of El Salvador (GoES) national disaster response and relief organization reported
that associated flooding and landslides have resulted in the deaths of more than 130 individuals, caused 70
persons to be reported missing, and displaced more than 13,600 others. GoES authorities have established 118
temporary shelters for displaced persons. The U.S. Embassy in San Salvador reports that the flooding and
landslides have affected the departments of San Salvador, Cuscatlan, La Paz, San Vicente, and La Libertad,
with the most significant damage reported in San Vicente and La Paz. Damage to roads and bridges has also
occurred. The President of El Salvador has declared a state of emergency for the five affected departments and
has requested international assistance.

On November 10, U.S. Chargé d'Affaires Robert Blau declared a disaster in response to the damage caused by
the tropical depressions and Hurricane Ida. In response, USAID/OFDA is providing $100,000 for the purchase
of water, blankets, and aviation fuel to assist affected populations. In addition, USAID/OFDA is airlifting relief
commodities, including 200 rolls of plastic sheeting, 5,000 hygiene kits, 5,000 five-gallon water containers, and

assistance to respond to humanitarian needs.
