Dear Jake: When I brought up next week's NPT PrepCom in staff meeting this morning, I was remiss in not mentioning
Susan Burk's leadership role. I'd appreciate it if you'd put this note before the Secretary. Thanks. RG



Ma'am: When I mentioned the great work of our Geneva team in preparing for the NPT PrepCom, I was remiss in not
highlighting the work of our NPT Special Envoy, Ambassador Susan Burk. She will be the head of delegation and has
been putting in a terrific amount of "shoe leather," as she calls it, to ensure that the PrepCom will be a success. We are
lucky to have such a talented and experienced diplomat leading our efforts.

With apologies for my omission,

RG
