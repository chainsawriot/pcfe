Subject: Chinese premier stresses need to keep Hormuz open (AP)

DOHA (AP) - China's premier is stressing the importance of keeping the Strait of Hormuz open after threats by
Iran to shut the strategic waterway.
   Chinese Premier Wen halm said Wednesday in the Qatari capital Doha that ensuring the security of the
strait is in all nations' interests. About a fifth of the world's oil supply flows through the narrow strait.
   He added that "any extremist action in this region will go against the will of all people in the world."
   China is a major customer for Iran's oil and gas. It has opposed tighter sanctions on Iran over Tehran's
disputed nuclear program and has called for a Middle East free of atomic weapons.
   The Chinese premier's Gulf tour has also taken him to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
