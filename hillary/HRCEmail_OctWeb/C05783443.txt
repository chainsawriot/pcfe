Subject: Israel, Hamas differ on second phase of swap deal (AP)

JERUSALEM (AP) - Israeli and Hamas officials are giving conflicting details about the upcoming second
phase of a swap deal that has already freed a captive Israeli soldier for 477 Palestinian prisoners.
   An Israeli official says Israel will select the remaining 550 Palestinians to be released in two months. The
official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
   But Hamas official Saleh Arouri says Israel has agreed to guidelines about who is to be freed, including
giving priority to elderly and prisoners serving long sentences.
   Thursday's disparate statements could increase tensions ahead of the second part of the swap.
   The deal freed Israeli soldier Gilad Schalit who was held by Hamas-backed militants in Gaza for five years.
