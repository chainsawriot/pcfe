Dear Steve,

I hope this note finds you well. I was at a meeting recently with Marc Grossman who suggested that you would be the
right person to approach with the following request:

As you know, I work with the local chapter of the Make-A-Wish Foundation here in Bethesda. The Make-A-Wish
Foundation grants wishes to children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with
hope, strength and joy. I love my job!

 We recently learned that we have a 17 year old young woman from New Jersey whose wish is to have lunch with
 Secretary Clinton! She says in part:

"In 2007 and 2008 I would stay up late with my dad watching the primary and election coverage, thrilled and excited
about what was going on. That was the first time I had ever seen the current Secretary of State in action....) had never
seen her speak before and I was enraptured. Mrs. Clinton's poise, intelligence and incredible speaking skills were
inspirational and ever since then, she has been an idol of mine. Her courage and strength in the political arena were
particularly important and moving to me when I got sick in March 2009 and again in December 2010."

Steve, would you be able to guide me - or this request - to the right person in the Department so that this request might
be made known to the Secretary for her consideration? Obviously, I stand ready to provide anything you might need in
order to further process.

With warm regards and appreciation for your assistance,

Maura
