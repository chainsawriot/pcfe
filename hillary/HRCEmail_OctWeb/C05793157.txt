But solid of Solomon to do a mea culpa, right?

Subject: Regret!

Jake: Just a note to say that I truly regret .a statement by one of my staff quoted in Sunday's NYTimes that seemed to
disparage State personnel deployed in Iraq. I will not elaborate on the (familiar) explanations of "statement out of
context," "not what he actually said, or meant" -- even though that is the case. I am writing a note to Ambassador Jim
Jeffry expressing regret, and the staffer is writing a personal letter to the Times to set the record straight. Nonetheless,
damage done. But I trust the constructive collaboration between USIP's Baghdad office and Jim's mission will continue. If
you have any questions or suggestions, please give me a call. Dick Solomon
