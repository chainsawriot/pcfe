Dear Hillary,
Below you will find a note from Valerie on a Global Zero summit at Yale in February. I want to take this occasion to
wish you, WJC and Chelsea and Marc all the very best this holiday season and in 2012. You have been a voice of reason
in the cacophony that passes for discourse in our international affairs, and a beacon of hope for women throughout the
world. Thank you and your family for your tremendous service to humankind. With warmest personal regards. Joe

Dear Madam Secretary,


              Joe and I have watched your world-wide travels from afar with amazement and
admiration (how do you do it??) — your energy and conviction of cause is evident, and we feel
fortunate that you are representing our country so magnificently. Thank you.




        Your office should have received a formal invitation several weeks ago from Global Zero
to speak to students from around the world interested in stopping nuclear proliferation at Yale
University on February 18th and 19th. Confirmed speakers include Ambassador Richard Burt,
Dr. Hans Blix, Dr. Lawrence Korb, Ambassador Steve Pifer, General (ret) Jack Sheehan and
myself. We would be truly delighted and honored if you could consider attending this special
event that will be so effective toward inspiring and igniting young people's passion and
concern about the nuclear threat. They will return to their various college campuses in the
United States and around the world to start Global Zero chapters so that politicians clearly
hear the voice of the people on this issue so critical to our civilization's survival. This
conference comes on the heels of two very successful Global Zero gatherings already this
year: London in June and at the Reagan Library in October.


        Also, we will be screening "Countdown to Zero" at the coming New Year's Renaissance
Weekend in Charleston, SC and hosting a panel afterward. I look forward to engaging more
folks on proliferation. To my way of thinking, if we don't get this right — then none of our other
concerns matter much.


        Attached, please find another copy of the invitation as well as information on the Yale
Summit


        Joe and I send our wishes for peaceful, happy holidays and a healthy and successful
2012.


        Thank you again for your consideration and please know that you are welcome any time
to our home in Santa Fe.


        Sincerely, Valerie Plame Wilson
