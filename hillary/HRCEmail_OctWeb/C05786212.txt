Kurt--

  When I spoke w ASSK, she mentioned she would be going online and asked for our help in getting good advice about
what and how to do it. What about asking Alec Ross to work w your team to design apps and other tools for her and
take Alec or someone from his team when you next go--which, as I told you, she is eagerly anticipating.

 Again, thx for ALL you're doing and the results your leadership is producing. All the bestâ€”H

Subject: Burma's Suu Kyi going online after detention (AP)



RANOON (AP) - Burma's pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi is ready to go online after years of detention when the
military regime allowed her virtually no contact with the outside world.
   The Nobel Peace Prize laureate was released from seven years of house arrest in November.
   Her security chief Win Htein said she has been allowed Internet access and will begin to broaden her domestic and
international contacts online after recovering from a cold and cough.
   He says that she may even be tweeting soon.
