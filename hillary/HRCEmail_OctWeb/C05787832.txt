Subject: Gunmen try to assassinate head of Libyan army (AP)


TRIPOLI (AP) - A spokesman for Libya's military says gunmen tried to kill the head of the army in a bold
daylight attack in the country's capital.
   Infantry spokesman Sgt. Abdel-Razik el-Shibahy says the army chief of staff was in a convoy Saturday
traveling from his home in Tripoli to the military headquarters when a group of armed men at a fake checkpoint
tried to stop them.
   He says Gen. Khalifa Hifter's convoy swerved from the checkpoint and drove over a nearby bridge where
they were shot at by two gunmen positioned on the other side.
   The spokesman says no one in the convoy was harmed and that soldiers arrested the two gunmen, who are in
military custody for questioning.
   Hifter's son, Belgasim, blamed a rival group of ex-rebel fighters.
