The film may make it to you in time for your departure for Burma. When we contacted the producer/director Jacques
Besson, he tried to get it to Busan by FEDEX or equivalents. It proved impossible so they have put a courier on a plane in
Paris to bring the DVD to Busan. He will arrive this morning and we are keeping our fingers crossed that he'll make it in
time this morning to get to your plane.

I saw the film in rough cut in Paris and then Jacques and Michelle Yeoh, who plays ASSK, agreed to come to State for a
small privAe showing they did for Kurt, Derrick, Philippe and a few others of us.

They have great admiration for you and wish you well on your trip to Burma.
ASSK knows about the film but does not want to see it. It would be too hard to watch as much of it is about her
                                      and the pain and sacrifice her commitment to Burma caused.

Michelle Yeoh saw ASSK a few months ago and told her all about producing the film.

Not too many hiccups here at the Forum. The Koreans are quite proud that they teamed with us on the Gender Plenary.
Much excitement about your being here.
