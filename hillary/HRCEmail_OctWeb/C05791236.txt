Subject: NATO denies man who killed 2 Americans was Western (AP)

KABUL, Afghanistan - (AP) A NATO spokesman has denied claims that the gunman who killed two
Americans inside the Interior Ministry in Kabul was another Westerner.
   Saturday's attack comes as tensions between the Afghans and the Americans are high following the burning
of copies of the Muslim holy book at a U.S. base that sparked days of deadly protests.
   Two Afghan officials said the ministry shooting did not involve any Afghans.
   But NATO spokesman Lt. Col Jimmie Cummings says that "intial reports say it was not a Western shooter."
