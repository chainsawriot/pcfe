Have been working it over with the team and there is some paralysis because of the uncertainty of what might happen
tomorrow. But I will get you something soon, before dinner.

Jeff and Robert and Fred met with Bogdanov. As Lavrov has probably told you, they are eager to get a monitoring
mission authorized by the UNSC, including using military observers from the Golan or the MFO or other places in the
region.

For my money, I think a monitoring mission is not a bad idea. But we'll need to take real care with the shape and scope
of a UNSC product â€” Susan's team is working with the Brits and French to be prepared for what the Russians might bring.
