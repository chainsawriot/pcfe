Subject: CSCC Thank You

Cheryl:


Please thank the Secretary on my behalf for her participation last week in the first CSCC
interagency Steering Committee. Her presence and her clear understanding of the
organization and the issues left a huge positive impression.


     be leaving at the end of February but ll w n't forget that this little project would have
died on the vine without the Secretary's interest and intervention at key moments.
