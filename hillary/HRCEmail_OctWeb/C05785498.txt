have a role in leading the political transition, which everyone has told him are not possible. We and our allies and
partners are all telling him the same thing that there must be a ceasefire, withdrawal from cities Q's forces have seized,
and Q's departure from power and, preferably, from Libya. There has. been as yet no positive or realistic response.
