                        My four traveling companions (Dennis Blair, Martin Indyk, Ken Lieberthal, Tanvi
                Madan) and I returned late last night from Beijing where we conducted a day-and-a-half Track II
                "trialogue" with two 5-person delegations assembled by the Chinese Institute of Contemporary
                International Relations (CICIR) and the New Delhi-based Centre for Policy Research (CPR). I'm
                including at the bottom of this message a list of the participants with relevant points about their
                backgrounds (you'll see we had two admirals and a major-general). I'm attaching to this email
                the fuller bios.
                       It's worth noting that that we had an easier several days in the Middle Kingdom that you
                did: we were there in the immediate aftermath of the U.S.-China Strategic & Economic
                Dialogue, which, of course, coincided with the denouement (such as it is) of the Chen
                Guangcheng drama, and the beginning of Sec. Clinton's visit to India by way of Bangladesh.
                        All parties to the trialogue felt that the exercise was basically fruitful and merits follow-
                up. We hope you'll agree with us on what might happen next: namely, a second meeting, to be
                held in or around Washington in September.
                                                                                                                        1.4(D)
                                                                                                                        B1

                                                                                                                1.4(D)

                In that regard, we agreed that we would, if asked by the press or anyone else about the
        meeting, acknowledge that it took place, emphasize that it was strictly a three-way engagement
        of think tanks, with the participants speaking entirely as private citizens, but under no
        circumstances would we divulge—on any basis—anything whatsoever about the agenda or the
        discussion. (Note that I've cc'd Toria on this message as well as the appropriate people on in
        S/P.)


        FORMAT AND TONE

                The formal sessions, held at a conference room at CICIR, started at 9 a.m. both days and
        went until dinner on Monday and through lunch on Tuesday, so we were at it for about 14
        hours. There were also numerous sidebars (the Indians and the US team were at the same
        hotel). The Chinese were all English-speaking so there was no time lost on translation. There
        were half a dozen CICIR staffers (or at least so identified) in the room listening carefully and in a
        couple of cases taking copious notes.
                                                                                                                1.4(D)
                                                                                                                B1
