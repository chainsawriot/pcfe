Madame Secretary:

I have looked into the issues Amb. Joe Wilson raised in his email and discreetly
reached out to our embassy in Dar Es Salaam to provide us with additional
background on GE and Symbion operations in Tanzania. A number of the points
Joe outlined are completely accurate. Tanzania indeed faces an enormous power
shortage and Symbion is a legitimate U.S. power company working in the
country. Our Embassy thinks highly of Symbion's work (you participated in an
Embassy.organized, MCC supported Symbion event during your visit to Tanzania
in June). The MCC program provided a $110 million contract to Symbion and a
conglomerate of other firms, including one other American company, to install
power lines and distribution sub stations across southern Tanzania.

The Tanzanian power crisis is acute and has been identified as a top constraint to
growth. The average Tanzanian has 2 to 3 hours of power and only 14% of
Tanzania has access to electricity. GE might look at investing in power generators
and related equipment. The country also has coal, gas, and considerable solar and
wind possibilities. GE would be well positioned to help Tanzania tap these types of
energy through their innovative equipment. GE has opened an office in Dar Es
Salaam and is currently considering potential investments. Ambassador Lenhardt
is in contact with GE and encouraging the company to get involved.




I hope this useful. Please let me know if you require additional information or
follow-up

Respectfully,

Johnnie

Additional Background on Symbion in Tanzania:

The CEO is a dual UK/US citizen national who has conducted business in Tanzania
since 1980 and is well-known to Tanzanian President Kikewete.

The MCC program provided a $110 million contract to Symbion and a
conglomerate of other firms, including Pike, another American firm. French firms
are also involved. By all accounts, Symbion has a good track record.

Recently, two U.S. firms (Richmond and Dowlan) were involved in a corruption
scandal, but they left Tanzania a couple of years ago. Symbion purchased the GE-
made equipment and power plant that Richmond and Dowlan left behind. The
Tanzanian government estimated it would take Symbion 6 months to restore the

equipment and power plant to full function, but Symbion had it back in service in 6
days. Very miraculous.

Tanzania purchases power from Symbion. Symbion needs a large turbine engine
to make the power plant fully operational. Only 80 mega watts are used. It can
bring on-line an additional 40 megawatts if it can access natural gas resources
located near the capital, but would need to build out pipes and other
equipment. GE has the technical capacity to assist if it jumps in.

Dear Mme. Secretary,
As you know from your recent trip, Tanzania is in the middle of an acute power crisis that is worsening by the day as the
hydro capacity literally dries up.
Symbion is attempting to address the crisis within the limits of our ability, but have been stymied in our discussions with
General Electric over the question of payment guarantees for purchase of the equipment.
I know that you mentioned that you were going to call Jeff Immelt after your trip. When you make that call, I would
appreciate your telling him that Symbion, which is already operating a GE plant in Dar can only expand that plant to
meet the challenge if GE is prepared to share some of the inherent risk with us and waives the payment guarantee
requirement. The risk is minimal as the equipment would remain under GE's ownership and control until fully paid off,
and would be portable (as the current plant is) in the event of default on the part of Tanesco or the government.
Only by being more creative can we hope to be responsive to the crisis in Tanzania and GE can easily do its part to
support your efforts in this "Partnership for Growth" country.
Paul and I are in DC this week and always available to discuss with you or your staff either in person or by phone.
Thanks very much and warm regards. Joe
