Subject: Israel to freeze funding to UNESCO (Reuters)

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel will freeze its funding to the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO following the
group's decision to grant the.Palestinians full membership, a statement from Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's office said November 3.

   The statement said UNESCO's decision this week hurt chances of reaching a peace deal with the Palestinians
and that Israel would halt its annual payments of $2 million.

   Israel's main ally, the United States, has also halted funding following Monday's vote in favour of the
Palestinians.
