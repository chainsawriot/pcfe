Hi Huma,
S wanted to see the LGBT draft last night on the last leg of the flight and the only draft ready to share
was an old oneâ€”megan and I were in the midst of making some major changes suggested by Jake,
Cheryl, and Mike P. So I believe Cheryl handed her the old draft.

We have now made the changes and, on the hope that S hasn't had the time to engage with the
old draft yet, would like to get this new one to her before she does.

Can this be emailed to Whitehaven for printing? Should I print it at the office and drop it off? Let me
know.

Also, if there's a way to let her know that this new draft is coming (so that she doesn't start to mark up
the old one if she hasn't already) that would be great.

Thanks,
Dan
