Subject: Jordan king to make rare West Bank visit Monday (Reuters)



AMMAN, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Jordan's.King Abdullah will make a rare visit to the occupied West Bank on
Monday, weighing in on behalf of the Palestinians' statehood drive amid stalled peace talks with Israel, officials
said.

  Abdullah, among the more outspoken critics of the diplomatic deadlock, will meet Palestinian President
Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah.

   "The visit comes in the context of Jordan's support for the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people to
achieve Palestinian national rights and an independent state," a Jordanian palace official told Reuters on
Sunday.

    The official Palestinian news agency WAFA said Abdullah and Abbas would "discuss the regional
situation".

  On Sunday, Abbas hosted U.S. envoy William Burns, who was due to hold talks with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Monday.

   The Obama administration has worked to block a bid by the Palestinians to sidestep Israel by applying
directly for full membership of the United Nations. Washington has also censured Israel for expanding its West
Bank settlements.

   Jordan is one of the few Arab countries to recognise Israel, though many of its populace are Palestinians
displaced during the 1948 war of the Jewish state's founding and their descendants.

   The government fears further instability will lead to a new influx of Palestinians which could stretch already
scant resources and raise tension with Jordanians.
