Subject:                     Great news about Amazon!




I'm forwarding below some info I just received from my DoS colleagues about a deal they
have concluded with Amazon. I think I mentioned it to you at one point last year. My idea
was to do a deal with Amazon for Kindles and their Kindle Apps for our Embassies and
American Spaces. My feeling was that it was a way to use technology to reach millions of
people and to provide them with instant access to books, magazines, newspapers, etc in
the way our old USIS libraries used to do. In addition, the Kindle "print to voice" feature
can also be used in our English language programs. In June I met with an NGO who has
piloted this feature for English language training quite successfully in Ghana.



Because of their global footprint and some unique aspects of their technology, Amazon are the only
people who can do all of this cost effectively at this point in time. I met with the Amazon folks last
year in Portland to describe my idea and get their support. They agreed to work on some
adjustments to their systems to handle our request. We then (somewhat miraculously!!!) worked the
idea through the various bureaucratic hurdles at DoS and the project is now ready to announce.



As you will note below, Jeff Bezos has offered co-host an event in NY with you to announce the
partnership and launch the initiative. The R team is working with your office to see if you can be in
NY March 27 or 29th. Hope you can do it. This is a really big deal and in line with all the work you
have done around new technologies. I promise to attend to cheer you on!!




Notes from Nick Lamba at IIP          Kathy Stephens should have all the details:



The " Kindle Mobile Learning Initiative"; will be the largest e-reader initiative ever
undertaken by any organization and will provide 21st-century access to information via

Kindle e-readers and other mobile devices (e.g., iPads, iPhones, etc.) through the Kindle
app for the 6 million annual visitors to our more than 800 American Spaces.



 Equally important, the partnership will provide English language materials to nearly 4,000
students in 17 countries who are currently enrolled in the English Access Microscholarship
Program

The Department and its partners can send eBooks, periodicals, information about
American society and culture and U.S. English language materials to students and
teachers via the Internet or cellular technology.



This enables the Department to create and seed a robust reliable information pipeline for
any target audience, especially in countries or regions where access to information is
limited by technology or censorship.



Launch Event

     We are working closely with Amazon on a global launch event in New York at the
United Nations.

      On February 2nd , IIP sent an appointment request to the Secretary asking for her to
host and deliver keynote remarks with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. Amazon proposed
February 21st as the launch date, due to her travel schedule the Secretary was
unavailable.



     Amazon subsequently proposed two additional dates, March 27 or March 29. We
shared this information with S staff.




Event details:

         Invitees: 600 (international community, press (technology, education, foreign policy,
etc.).



         Why New York?

          u The thought leaders we want to attend the event are also primarily based in
          NYC (publishers, technology companies, writers (education, technology,
          international affairs, authors, etc.).



          u The purpose of this event is to highlight a global vision of technology and how
          it's being utilized. The business and technology media (traditional and social
          media) we would want to attend and cover the event are based in NYC. Amazon
          added that NYC conveys a broader view of business, technology, publishing
          (reading) and innovation.



          u The press coverage we would get would be much broader in NYC (technology,
          education, foreign policy, etc.). The majority of the media and influencers that
          cover/watch Amazon Kindle are based in New York.



           Amazon recommended the UN as the launch site, as it will reinforce the US
         position that business and government must work together (with civil society) to
         solve global challenges.
