27,255 People Call for Clinton to Take Lead on
Congo Certification
Posted by Chloe Christman on Sep 15, 2011

Over the past several months, the Raise Hope for Congo Campaign, in partnership with Care2 and change.org,
has been gathering signatures from activists around the country calling on Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to
be a leader for certification for Congo's conflict minerals.

Yesterday, those 27,255 signatures were delivered to Secretary Clinton's Chief of Staff, Cheryl Mills, by none
other than actress and activist Robin Wright.

We've petitioned Hillary Clinton because she has the gravitas to make a difference and because we know she
cares.

Just over two years ago she visited the region and said: "The international community must start looking at
steps we can take to try to prevent the mineral wealth from the DRC ending up in the hands of those who fund
the violence."

We couldn't agree more, but we're ready to see her take concrete steps to follow through on her commitment.
Members of Congress, leaders of the private sector, and civil society groups in eastern Congo agree that
certification is a necessary next step to help stem the violence fueled by minerals in eastern Congo â€” and that
the U.S. must play a leading role.

In the words of Arthur Vaeni from Washington, who added his name to the thousands of others: "Given your
commitment to women's rights throughout the world, I urge you to take a leadership role in response to this
great need. The right to live free from fear of rape and other forms of violence is fundamental to the well being
of all people."

Secretary Clinton, we hope you'll be moved by this call from others like yourself who care about ending the
conflict in Congo. We hope you'll follow through on the commitment you made to the people you visited by
being a leader for certification.

The Raise Hope for Congo campaign will be watching closely to see how Clinton responds to the strong
message activists sent through this petition. This fall, Enough's Raise Hope for Congo campaign is turning its
attention to ensuring Clinton backs her compelling words up with action, so stay tuned for ways you can use
your voice in the coming months.
