SBU

Jake,

I just received a call
                                                One issue involving S that is on the agenda for the call (and
therefore may come up at breakfast) is an exemption from the Tier III terrorist organization ineligibility under
the INA for visas or entry into the U.S. of individuals associated with the KDP, PUK and INC.




                                                                                  I wanted you to know in the
event it is raised tomorrow.

Regards,

Tim
