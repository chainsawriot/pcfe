Subject: Thanks to the Secretary

Dear Huma,

Please pass on my deepest gratitude to the Secretary for carving out a time for us to stop by and chat for a few minutes
last week. She listened so attentively to our concerns for the integrity of PEPFAR and for the recognition of the faith
community's contribution to global health. I told my team that they would find her gracious, engaging, and personable
â€” they weren't disappointed!

Warmly,
Kay
