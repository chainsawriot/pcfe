Subject: News for the Secretary and you

Cheryl,

Greetings to the Secretary and you. She has been getting some great press (the Economist, for instance) and
facing down major challenges with energy and strength. You all should be proud of what you have
accomplished.

Even life at NYU seems a global whirlwind. For instance, its' nothing compared to Hillary's travel, but I've been
on five global trips since early December: India, Malaysia, the UAE, and China twice.

Here's an update on my coming plans. If you would, let the Secretary know that this is good for me and for
NYU.

Let me know how I can help, if needed.

All the best,

Jerry
