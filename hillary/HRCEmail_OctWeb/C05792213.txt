Johnnie

I returned Jesse Jackson Sr's call to S. He is seeking to speak to her regarding his pending visit next week to S.A. to
celebrate the ANC's anniversary and would like to be able to represent her/Admin thinking on any issues/opportunities
that might arise.

Can you advise what the nature of this anniversary is for the ANC (how many years and scope of celebration);
                                                        and any background/guidance                         to share
with him

Thanks.
