                                          Major Developments Report

    •      Media Reports: Rioter Shot and Killed by Haitian Police — The Daily Telegraph reports Haitian
           police have opened fire on a group of looters, killing at least one of them as hundreds of rioters

            ransacked a market in quake-hit Port-au-Prince. Elsewhere there were reports of officers stepping aside
            to allow vigilantes to deal with looters. (1100, 1/17 Telegraph)

       • Conflicting Reports on Security: While JTF-H reported relative calm in PAP during the morning IA
         Concall, mounting USG reports show the security situation deteriorating. National Security Agency
         (NSA) reports looting turned violent in PAP on Saturday, when a mob of around 1,000 people fought for
         goods in a central commercial street. Men with stones, knives, ice-picks and hammers battled to grab t-
         shirts, bags, and other items. Also, Embassy PAP reports escapees from the National Prison are re-
         forming gangs and re-arming to start kidnappings and other activities. Gunfire was heard in some
         neighborhoods overnight. More National Police were out .yesterday, but too few to maintain
         order. MINUSTAH MIL and UNPOL have been patrolling as well. Both DG of Police and
         MINUSTAH appear to be traumatized by their losses. Embassy PAP INL Officer: Command and
         Control is urgently needed to maintain order. (1210, 1/17, Embassy INL email)

       •    Water Remains Key Concern: The GoH has identified safe drinking water as the most urgent
            need among affected populations. Significant capability to produce potable water exists in Haiti
            through several private sector companies according to the USAID DART. The JTF-H is distributing
            water at 9 locations around the city and OFDA has identified and additional 5 for use today. GoH
            and UN are planning on placing additional sites online today. The capacity to produce water is
            estimated to be at least 1 million gallons per day. (0900, 1/17, IA Concall/internal sources)

       •    Shortage of Trucks and Fuel: The limiting factor for aid distribution is transport capacity. This
            fact, exacerbated by the airport's limited capacity to receive, warehouse, and dispatch relief
            supplies. The road to DR is reported as open with a travel time of 2hrs to PAP, but warehousing
            and truck transport capacity are major challenges. Trucks are available in the Dominican
            Republic, but drivers will not make the journey unless security is assured. U.S. Marine units are
            expected to greatly augment transport capacity with their arrival Tuesday, 19 January. Fuel
            reserves remain dangerously low, potentially impacting both transportation and
            communications. (0900, 1/17, IA Concall)


       •    PAP Embassy Resupply: Embassy Santo Domingo started an overland convoy system delivering
            food, water, and fuel. Santo Domingo also provided some extra vehicles to help ferry
            AMCITs. Santo Domingo will be running regular convoys of food, water, and fuel to PaP. (1000,
            1/17, internal email)
