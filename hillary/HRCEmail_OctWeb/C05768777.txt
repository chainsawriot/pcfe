Here's why we are doing the right thing w/ 21st c statecraft — from our ambassador in Moscow               It's long, but
worth reading. Our frame is that the world is deeply interconnected, but part of what we then need to do as diplomats is

"Over the last few weeks, there have been some fascinating examples of Russian grass roots activists using new
connection technologies to make an impact. These have not only been bread and butter issues, but hard-hitting anti-
corruption and political actions.



VOTING FRAUD

Today, Russian liberal internet media is awash with stories of voting fraud and electoral manipulation taking place in the
local election campaigns slated for March 14 (early voting started). The liberal Yabloko posted a video on the internet of
united Russia activists in Tula buying early votes. Kommersant Tula correspondent reported a united russia activist
coming to his door offering 300 rubles for his vote. Video posted around web now, including on grani.ru

ROCK CONCERT IMPASSIONED PLEA

On March 7, Yuriy Schevchuk, lead singer for Russian group DDT delivered a powerful anti-regime speech to a crowd of
15000 in Moscow's Olympic stadium. It was filmed and posted on Youtube and elsewhere, becoming viral (over 175,000
viewings and 500 comments posted as of yesterday). Below is quote:

"The system that has been built in our country is brutal, cruel, and inhumane. People are suffering, not only in prisons
and camps, but in orphanages and hospitals as well. So many bastards are feeding themselves on power. With
epaulettes on their shoulders and with flashing lights in their heads, they are robbing us, running us over on the road,
and shooting us in stores. And nobody is being held accountable."
