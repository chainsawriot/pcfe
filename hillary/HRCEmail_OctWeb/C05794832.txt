USUN is all set for you today. Scott Turner from USUN will greet you upon arrival and take care of escorting you up to
the secure room and then back down to the car after the call is completed. We will make sure Ops and USSS are all
looped in so this is as smooth as possible.

I may have to do the secure call from USUN instead of my home. Pls try to arrange for me. Thx.
