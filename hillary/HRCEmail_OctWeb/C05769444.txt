                                               Major Developments Report

    •    Touchdown at Dover: The remains of 7 US citizens (3 USG family members and 4 private citizens) arrived
         Dover AFB at 0414 on 1/24. (TF1/SOUTHCOM)
    •    Cuban Airspace Open for Business: Over-flight procedures with Cuba are operational as of 1000 on
         1/24. All U.S. military and civilian aircraft carrying humanitarian relief can fly straight to Gitmo. (1/23 ICC
         brief, 1024 1/24 email from R, Zuniga to WHA)
    •    Hotel Montana Families Begin Grieving Process: The Lynn U. families' 1/23 visit to the Montana on
         went well - no press were allowed, and USAID PaP reports that the families now appreciate both the level
         of devastation and the work of the SAR teams. The GoH has not called off SAR - yesterday's live rescue
         reinvigorated their desire to continue. SAR Teams from Fairfax County and LA are still working at the
         Montana. (0900 1/24 IA conf. call, 2140 1/23 email from P. Cantrell)
    •      Banks and Remittance Houses Operating: After opening on 1/23, banks experienced long lines at first
          which normalized by early afternoon. Emb. PaP reports the situation is the same Sunday, 1/24. On 1/23,
          DoS, USAID and SOUTHCOM delivered $2 million in cash from the Charleston Finance Center to banks that
          would have had to cease operations due to depletion of cash reserves. (1/24 USAID Sitrep #22, 0900 1/23
          IA conf. call, 0900 1/24 IA conf. call)
    •     Security at Embassy PaP Deteriorating: 2 -3 thousand people massed outside Emb. PaP overnight
          1/23-4; the FAST Team is concerned about keeping control of the site. Most of the congregants are people
          claiming to accompany Amcit minors, but the size and unruliness of the crowd is putting those minors at
          risk of injury. The official queue is now limited to 1,200 daily; documented Amcits are always admitted
          ahead of visa applicants. (0900 1/24 IA conf. call)
    •     Orphans Getting Great Care at Emb. PaP: The Embassy is giving CIS more office space and LES help. The
          current caseload is 100 orphans per day; this is the limit for responsible, accurate processing of cases. The
          consular section has kitted out the orphan waiting room with food, water, mattresses and blankets,
          bathrooms and a diaper changing station. Traffic through the area is restricted to USG officers, who love to
          visit the orphans and get a hug from the affectionate children. (0900 1/24 IA conf. call)
    •    Haitians Fed Up with GoH: Haitians questioning lack of GoH action reproached President Preval at the
         1/23 memorial for Archbishop Joseph Serge Miot and Vicar Charles Benoit, shouting "We want Aristide to

         come back. Get out, Preval." On 1/22, a group gathered outside the Judicial Police Headquarters, now the
         government headquarters, to stage a demonstration ahead of a news conference with Dominican Foreign
         Minister Carlos Morales. Security forces had to contain the protesters, who shouted in Creole, "Preval,
         speak, speak. We want cooperation, not intervention," a criticism of the growing U.S. military
         presence. Speaking to the media, PM Bellerive said, "The Americans are here at our request to help us out
         in our humanitarian or security needs." (Mexico City Notimex in Spanish, 1/23 Humanitarian Crisis-
         Disaster Recovery, Response & Relief, Open Source Center Haiti Portal)
    •    Fatalities and Evacuations: 1 USG employee and 3 EFMs of a USG employee are confirmed dead. 2 USG
         employees remain unaccounted for - 1 CDC employee and 1 USAF major, both believed to be in the Hotel
         Montana. Private Amcit injuries and fatalities: 50 confirmed, 19 unconfirmed. 15,666 passengers
         evacuated to date, of which 12,497 are,American citizens. Last night's departures included actress Mario
         Bello (Artists for Peace and Justice) and screenwriter Paul Haggis (Crash, Flags of Our Fathers), who left
         Haiti on a private airplane. (0500 1/24 PaP SitRep, 0900 1/24 IA conf. call)
