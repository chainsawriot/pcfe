Subject: Yemeni president returns after medical treatment (AP)

WASHINGTON (AP) - Yemen's outgoing president has returned to his home country after receiving medical
treatment in the U.S.
   The Yemeni Embassy in Washington says Ali Abdullah Saleh arrived in Yemen early Saturday local time.
   Saleh, Yemen's longtime autocratic leader, spent about three weeks in the U.S. receiving treatment for
injuries he suffered during a June rocket attack on his compound. U.S. officials also believed Saleh's absence
could ease a political transition in Yemen, a key U.S. counterterrorism partner.
   Yemenis cast votes this week in a single-candidate contest to install a new leader. Yemeni officials have said
Saleh planned to attend a transfer of power ceremony.
