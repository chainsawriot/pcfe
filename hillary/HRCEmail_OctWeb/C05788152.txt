Subject: Memo scandal witness refuses to travel to Pakistan (AP)

ISLAMABAD - (AP)         The lawyer for the chief witness in a secret memo scandal that has roiled Pakistan says
his client will not travel to the country to testify out of fear of being detained.
   Lawyer Akram Sheikh said Monday that Mansoor Ijaz is willing to videotape his testimony and submit it to
Pakistan's Supreme Court commission investigating the scandal.
   Ijaz was scheduled to appear before the commission on Tuesday. He has accused the Pakistani government of
orchestrating a memo, which he delivered to the U.S. last year, asking Washington for help in stopping a
supposed military coup in the wake of the American raid that killed Osama bin Laden.
   The Pakistani government has denied any involvement.
