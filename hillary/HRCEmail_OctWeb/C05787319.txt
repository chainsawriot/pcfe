Hillary, Marjo asked me to get the following to you.

                       Strobe


As I noted when we saw each other at the football game, I wrote you a brief note of condolence but realized I was not sure
where to send it. Strobe also suggested that email might be easier so I have rewritten my note here and am asking Strobe
to forward it to you at the appropriate address.                                                      I also heard that the
service was lovely.

November 4, 2011

Dear Hillary,

I was truly sorry to hear about your mother's passing earlier this week.




We all admire what you do for so many every day.

Most Sincerely,

Marjo
