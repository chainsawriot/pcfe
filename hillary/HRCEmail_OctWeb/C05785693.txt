Think of this during all those tough times:




Dexter Filkins has a major piece on yemen in the new yorker and has this on Tarrokol Karman, a
Yemen woman who has been the leader among the protestors in Yemen.

A few days later, I visited Karman's house, in central Sanaa. On the mantel in the sitting room
were framed photographs of four people: Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela,
and Hillary Clinton. Karman had met Clinton in January, just before the uprising began. Her
organization, Women Journalists Without Chains; receives funding from the U.S. government. The
meeting with Clinton was arranged by the U.S. Embassy, she said. Looking at the picture of
Clinton, she added, "I don't want to be foreign minister, but she is my role model."
