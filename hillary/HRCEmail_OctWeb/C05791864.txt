I get lots of these but thought this one to be interesting.



Dear Pam
if you see previous email, you will see that I was thinking about you right at the moment you fired your email.
I was an exchange between Gabe and I.

1. Laurent Lamothe, 39 - My good friend spent the past 5 sleepless nights thinking if he would accept the PM
position.

2. Friends and Family, including myself, believe that he has no choice. He will just sacrifice all his chances of
succeeding Martelly in 2015.

3. Martelly is NOT CRAZY, nor DUMB as many may think. He is WILD of course and uses vulgarity to
BULLY his opponents.

4. Martelly likes being portrayed as having a "double personality inside" - Michel and Sweet Micky:

5. Laurent Lamothe is US educated and polished, young, successful but inexperienced. He has good vibes, he
has a sharp business mind and wants to remain "clean".

6. Laurent told me that, if he accepts to become PM, Martelly will MAKE concessions to let him make HARD
DECISIONS and Martelly will accept to BE ON HIS BEST BEHAVIOR.

During the Carnaval festivities:
A lady from the France Embassy told me last week: The USA is sending the "iron lady" to Haiti. That woman
has a reputation. Murten is too weak. With the new US Embassador: "Fini la recreation". (I remained
speechless, I smiled and I said: "Wao!"
