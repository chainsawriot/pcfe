DISCLAIMER: This is probably a LOT more than you bargained for, but since you asked...

I think there were two main reasons you didn't like what are now the two old new berrys:

1) You didn't like the physical changes in the new models as compared to your longtime berry (one was absurdly large,
both had touchpads instead of trackballs, etc)

2) Less obvious, you didn't like Blackberry's most current operating system - its software interface that gives it its look
and feel to the user - which came installed on the new devices. In that you are not alone. Blackberry has taken a lot of
grief over it from users and critics. I can't stand it.

So without having actually seen your latest new old berry, I'm guessing that the reason you like it is the familiarity of the
device coupled with the familiar operating system. It's just like the old one. If not identical, awfully close.

Problem is, one of the very few upsides of the new operating system is the incorporation of the emoticon chart with the
texting feature.

So you're in a bit of a Catch-22: to get back what you like you're going to have to revert to what you didn't like -
meaning, the latest operating system.

When I can get my hands on it, I'll know for sure if that's the problem

Thanks for forwarding to Sheryl.

I am quite bereft that I've lost the emoticons from my latest new old berry. Is there anyway I can add them?

I shared with Sheryl Sandberg the portion of your interview with Rachel Combe of Elle that was about her. Sheryl sent
the thank you note below through Sarah Feinberg (formerly of Rahm's office, currently working with Joe Lockhart at
Facebook).




Secretary Clinton,

I saw the comments you made in Elle and wanted to say thank you.

Your personal comments about me were so nice and so appreciated. On the debate on the "ambition gap", you
summarized more clearly what I am trying to say than anyone has by far. You are exactly right. I am frustrated by all of
the ways women hold themselves back and feel less confident than they should. My point has been to try to empower
them to believe they can do it and therefore get the leadership roles they deserve. Thank you for understanding and for
being able to say this so clearly.

The highlight of my last few weeks was not the filing of our S-1, but the invitation to have dinner with you. I am really
looking forward to it. I also have had a chance to get to know Chelsea a bit recently and as you of course know, she is
spectacular.

I look forward to seeing you soon.

Warmly yours,

Sheryl
