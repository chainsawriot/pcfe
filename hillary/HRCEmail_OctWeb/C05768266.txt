Raj:

Hope you are well and that you are having a good trip. I'm very much looking forward to catching up when you get back
hearing how it all went, particularly in Pakistan.

As you and I have discussed briefly on several occasions, most of us feel there is a need to dramatically increase global
awareness of USG assistance efforts. I have raised this issue with the Secretary and others at State and I would like to
propose that Anne Marie, you and I co-host a small gathering of individuals from State, USAID and representatives from
the private sector and NGO community to help us evaluate where we are and to develop some new approaches. If you
agree, we can figure out a time which works for everyone and put together a list of people to invite. I'm happy to take
the lead in organizing it. Let me know what you think.

Safe travels.

Judith
