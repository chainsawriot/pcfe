Cheryl,
It was a GREAT speech!


You have probably already seen this — but just in case:


Oxfam reaction: Hillary Clinton

Oxfam's Gregory Adams said: "Secretary Clinton has thrown down the gauntlet about the need for real changes to
improve foreign assistance.

"But negotiators in Busan have kicked the can down the road, delaying decisions about a plan for better aid for another
six months.

"Secretary Clinton's challenge can't be met without global monitoring systems to keep donors and partners honest. This
won't be decided until June 2012.

"Secretary Clinton said thinking needs to shift from aid to investment. For people in poor countries to take advantage of
investments, they've got to have the right to speak out about what works for them and call foul when aid is stolen or
wasted. Secretary Clinton sent a clear message: development is about rights, and aid needs to support people's rights to
walk their own path out of poverty."

Subject: Busan Update and request

Cheryl,

We continue to do all we can to support and push for what we hope will be a strong US position and Secretary Clinton
statement in Busan - including yesterday's NPR story (see text and highlighted quote below) and the recent NYT
piece. Reminder: our key staffer in Busan is Greg Adams                                His cell              . He is
available to help you in any way he can.

At this point it would help immensely to get an early peek at the secretary's speech. Our Oxfam International team is
working media re: the speech. We'd like to them to say something positive, but need a sense of what's in there to tee up
our response. Could we get a draft this evening or early AM Busan time?

Thanks so much.

Linda Delgado (on behalf of Paul O'Brien)

NPR Story: Clinton To Test Myanmar's Readiness For Reforms; by Michele Kelemen Morning Edition
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sets off for Asia Monday, and part of her trip will see her as the first U.S. secretary of
state to visit Myanmar —formerly known as Burma. Secretary Clinton says she's going to Myanmar to test the waters to
see how committed the country's new leader is to reforms. She'll also meet with Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi,
who is rejoining the political process in the country and who has been guiding U.S. policy, according to activist Aung Din.
"She has been in touch with U.S. authorities all the time," Din says. "U.S. policy right now is being guided by her [and]
she's our key figure to unifying the country."

Aung San Suu Kyi, who has spent years in prison and under house arrest, has made it clear that she's ready to work now
with Myanmar's new president, Thein Sein, who has begun to open up the country in recent months. Aung Din is not so
sure. "Even though I'm not very confident yet, I have to support it," he says. Din is a former student activist who spent
more than four years in jail before fleeing the country and starting up an advocacy group called U.S. Campaign for
Burma. He backed the Obama administration's approach of maintaining sanctions while also trying to engage
Myanmar's leaders. He calls Clinton's trip risky, but hopes she will deliver a tough message to the regime. "I just wish
the regime will take this visit seriously and respond positively by making some concessions," he says. "Importantly, the
releasing of all remaining political prisoners and ending the civil war with ethnic minorities." Secretary Clinton told NBC
recently that these are all issues that will be high on her agenda.
"They need to begin to look at how they resolve these ethnic conflicts that have driven tens of thousands of Burmese of
different ethnicities into refugee status," Clinton said. "They have to have a real electoral system with an open door to
political parties and free expression."
Clinton says this is about whether Myanmar is on a path to democracy. Before going to Myanmar, Clinton will be
attending a conference in Busan, South Korea. That's where donor nations and recipients are grappling with another
major challenge: tight budgets.

"The background truth that we are facing up to is [that] we are going to have to do a lot more with a lot less," says Paul
O'Brien of Oxfam America.
O'Brien'says that the conference will bring together donors and developing countries to talk about a deal they had
made. If poorer countries clean up corruption and manage their finances better, donors will try to be more predictable
with their aid. O'Brien says the latest reports show that donors are not keeping their end of the bargain. On the 13
indicators that the donors were supposed to meet, they failed on 12 of them and succeeded on one, and the only one
they succeeded on was talking to each other more," he says. "So this whole idea that, 'you guys get your act together,
we will trust you more,' is failing."
In the meantime, emerging powers like China have been offering big investments in Africa and Latin America without all
the strings attached. They have a lot of money to invest but they don't want to see discussion in the same way around
democracy, human rights and transparency, O'Brien says.
"So the real question for the secretary is: is she going to be able to move the discussion back towards what we were all
there for in the first place?" he says. "Let's get these countries to be more accountable and let's hold them accountable
and let's make sure their citizens can hold them accountable [That's] the deeper political agenda that we have all been
 working on for many decades."
That's an agenda Secretary Clinton will be trying to push both in Korea and in Myanmar this week.
