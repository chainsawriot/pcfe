Subject: Trinidad PM says assassination plot uncovered (AP)

PORT-OF-SPAIN (AP) - Trinidad's prime minister says police have uncovered an apparent plot to assassinate
her and members of her government.
  Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar gave no specifics of the alleged plot, but says it was a response to her
government's ongoing state of emergency to tackle crime.
   The prime minister said in a press conference criminal groups have been hobbled by her administration's
crackdown, "so I am not surprised such elements would seek to make good on their threats of reprisals" for the
emergency orders imposed in August.
   Police Commissioner Dwayne Gibbs also declined to provide any specifics. But he said about a dozen
people have been detained in the alleged plot. Their identities were not released.
