Subject: FW: revised Kerry bill

Folks: We received indirectly this draft Kerry bill -- the Foreign Assistance Revitalization and Accountability Act of 2009 --
 drafts of which have been sent to OMB/NSC but not yet to us. Rich asked that I share it with you right away, before
circulating it more broadly within the building for comment.
