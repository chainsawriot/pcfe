Cheryl:

The OASGA still has not started. The Argentine President has arrived, but Zelaya has not.

I am working this event from my home.                                                            We have Hector           B6
Morales, Craig Kelly, and Dan Restrepo at OAS Headquarters.

As I noted earlier, we will almost certainly have a resolution that suspends Honduras. There has been some talk about
using the resolution to urge countries to impose economic sanctions. Honduras (Zelaya government) finally said no to
that.

We are also working to convince Zelaya that now is not the time to return to Honduras. We are trying to get Insulza to
talk with the Argentine president about this. Hector spoke with the Dominican president earlier in the day, who is also
weighing in on the side of sanity.

That is all for the moment. This will probably go very late.

Tom
