Subject: Clinton blasts Russia and China over Syria (AP)

TUNIS (AP) - U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has blasted Russia and China for opposing U.N.
Security Council action on Syria, calling it "despicable."
  Clinton says she's willing to go back to the U.N. as often as needed "but we need to change the attitude of the
Russian and Chinese governments."
  She spoke Friday at an international conference in Tunisia aimed at persuading Syrian President Bashar
Assad and his allies into accepting demands for a democratic transition.
