Subject: Egypt bars British woman from leaving country (AP)


CAIRO (AP) - A British woman has been barred from leaving Egypt because she is on a list of foreigners under
investigation over ties to foreign nonprofit groups accused of fomenting unrest in the country.
   An airport security official says she was ordered off a London-bound plane February 10 in Cairo.
   The official says the woman works at a U.S. nonprofit group accused of illegally using foreign funds to
finance activities to destabilize Egypt. Sixteen Americans and 27 Europeans and Egyptians have been referred
to trial on those charges. At least 10, including six Americans, have been barred from leaving.
   The case has threatened Egypt-US relations, and shocked pro-democracy groups.
   The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the case. There was no immediate comment from the
British Embassy.
