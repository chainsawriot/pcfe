Subject:                       Iran and Israel...



For what it's worth, my two cents, given Obama's statement yesterday, I think you can make two
more forward statements on the Iranian situation without crossing a red line of appearing to interfere
or become an internal factor: 1. The Iranians should adhere to their own standards on elections
guaranteed by their law; and 2. The Iranian government should curb the political violence unleashed
by paramilitary militias. You can underline Obama's remark that "the world is watching" but put it in
the more memorable form: "The whole world is watching." On Bibi's speech, given the Iranian crisis
he is getting a pass for the moment. Good timing for him. Consequently, he is on a "I'm reasonable"
tour, his favorability has skyrocketed in the latest poll by more than 20 points, and Malcolm Hoenlein
is going around spreading the word that Obama cannot be trusted. The shortcomings of Bibi's poison
pill proposal should be pointed out as soon as it's possible without complicating the Iranian crisis.
Option: Pretend his statement in favor of two states is a new position (it's in fact a reiteration of his
detailed position before in more or less the same terms) but point out that his terms (his substance)
would make impossible what he now says he favors. In other words, catch his transparently false and
hypocritical ploy not as false and hypocritical but as a contradiction in its own terms. Sid
