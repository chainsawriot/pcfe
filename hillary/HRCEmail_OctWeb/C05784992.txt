Dear Cheryl,

Forgive me for writing to you directly, but I want to thank you and the Secretary for the extraordinary speech she gave
yesterday. It was thrilling to watch her deliver it and to spend so much time on LGBT issues in front of that audience. I
believe this will go down as one of the most important speeches ever delivered on global LGBT issues. The effect here at
home has been extraordinary, as well. LGBT blogs are blowing up, and larger news sources covered this, along with the
President's memo, as rightly significant. I am so proud to work for this Secretary and this administration.

Thank you for making yesterday happen and for driving LGBT issues throughout the State Department.

All the best,

Jon Tollefson
