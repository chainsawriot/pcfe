Jake: I thought you and HRC might want to be aware that the Bangladeshi press is reporting that Tony Rodham met with
Bangladeshi opposition leader Begum Zia earlier this week and allegedly conveyed the Secretary's regrets she could not
meet Zia.



           but I wanted you to be aware of public reporting of Rodham's conveying of greetings. Best, Bob




Khaleda meets US Congressmen
They express concern over human rights situation of Bangladesh
Khaleda ZiaUNB, Dhaka

US Congressmen expressed deep concern over the human rights situation in Bangladesh as well as that of the judiciary when they met with visiting
BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia in the Capitol Hill in Washington on Wednesday.

Khaleda Zia had a joint meeting with four US congressmen -- Joseph Crowley, Sheila Jackson, Hansen Clarke and Brad Sherman.

A representative of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was present during the meeting.

Different issues, including democracy and rule of law in Bangladesh, came up for discussion in the meeting that lasted for one and half hours.

BNP vice-chairman Shamser Mobin Chowdhury, who was present in the meeting, told UNB over phone that the Congressmen said if democracy and
rule of law are threatened in Bangladesh, the US Congress will take a serious note of this as it might make uncertain Bangladesh's access to the US
Millennium Challenge Account.

The US Congressmen told Khaleda that they are monitoring the evolving situation in Bangladesh and would brief the US administration.

They recalled good relation of the Congress and the US administration with the past government of Khaleda Zia and hoped the relation would be
strengthened.

Khaleda invited the Congressmen to visit Bangladesh.

Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has expressed regret as she could not meet with Khaleda due to her preoccupations.

Hillary Clinton conveyed the regret through her younger brother Tony Rodham to Khaleda at her Hotel Marriot suite in Washington on Wednesday.

Senator John Kerry also expressed his regret for not being able to meet with Khaleda and conveyed this through a special aide.
