Greg -
As an fyi, we have heard that two House offices may ask Secretary Clinton a question, either publicly or privately, related
to Saudi Arabia's failure to pay its debt owed to Gibbs and Hill. Specifically, Chairwoman Ros-Lehtinen indicated her
intention to raise the issue directly with the Secretary prior to the hearing. In this regard, please be aware that the
Chairwoman previously raised this issue during an October 6, 2011 meeting with Deputy Secretary Nides, though no
follow-up was taken according to the Chairwoman's staff. In addition, Congressman Chabot's staff has indicated that he
may raise this issue during his question period. We will notify you should we learn additional details or confirm the
Members' intentions.
