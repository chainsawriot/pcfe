SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED




Afghanistan Staffing

    •   Pat noted that he is working with Jack on various civilian staffing models for Afghanistan.

Goldstone

    •   Anne-Marie said she had attended Goldstone's lecture yesterday where he had largely stayed away from
        discussion of his report, other than to note that the perpetrators generally "dump on the process." In an
        interview with Judy Woodruff, Goldstone said that he did not think the Administration had rejected his report
        entirely, noting that they had in effect embraced his central recommendation — that both sides conduct
        "credible public inquiries" within six months. Anne-Marie thinks that if there were such inquiries, Goldstone
        would be prepared to say that the two sides had complied with his recommendation.

Congressional Issues

    •   The SFRC business committee meeting was postponed until November 17.

    •   Senators Feinstein and Kyle leave for the START talks in Geneva tonight.

Public Affairs

    •   Expect questions on the incident involving North and South Korean naval vessels, as well as Iran.

    •   60 Minutes is moving forward with story on corruption and President Karzai.

Korea

•   I noted that public reaction to the naval incident between North and South Korea has thus far been restrained
    on both sides.
