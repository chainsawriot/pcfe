Two important dates for me:

Oct 12--my friend, Joe Hankins, is celebrating 40 years as head of Westchester Community College and I'd like to go to
his ceremony.

Oct 15--is the big fundraiser/ concert for the Clinton Foundation in LA that I want to be sure to attend

So, we need to find ways to get to both.
