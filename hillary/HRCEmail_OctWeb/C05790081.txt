Subject: Serbian elections

Jake -- Here is quick take on Serbian elections, which went very smoothly. Our OSCE deal held. Can you share with S? I
will send separate note on the others (France, Greece, etc.)

Serbian elections

The OSCE program to facilitate balloting in Kosovo for Serbia's parliamentary and presidential elections was a
tremendous success: OSCE operated 90 polling stations in 28 locations; no unrest or problems. Two illegal northern
municipalities concurrently ran local elections. Kosovo authorities did not move against them, and Serbian officials have
repeatedly said they will not respect the results as UNMIK ruled there could be no Serbian local elections in Kosovo. As
for Serbia itself, voting went smoothly, with the usual reports of fairly minor irregularities. Very early results suggest a
virtual tie between Tadic and Nikolic for president; the second round will be on May 20 (which will again require OSCE to
handle voting in Kosovo). Tadic and Nikolic's parties are also tied in parliamentary elections (about 24% each, similar to
their presidential numbers).                                                                                                 1.4(D)
