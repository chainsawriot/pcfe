Re: Egyptian Revolution



I'm sure you must have received all possible options from highly informed people, but in what is likely to be redundant
and certainly less informed than others here is my two cents for what it's worth.

Renewed calls for an end to violence at this point may only appear as implicit encouragement to Mubarak to suppress
the revolution quickly. Mubarak has already lost. Egyptian society has made its decision. He may succeed in quelling the
revolution, but in doing so will only guarantee a fiercer and more radical outcome in the future. That is not in the US
interest.

I suspect measures short of the following will likely lead to convulsive violence with the least positive results in Egypt
and radical discrediting of the US position in Egypt and the Arab world:

1.    Mubarak should immediately declare that neither he nor his son will be candidates in national elections to be held
in the fall. He should invite UN and international observers to insure that these elections are conducted freely and fairly.
2.    The US should inform Mubarak that future aid will be contingent on free and fair elections in the fall in which
neither he nor his son are candidates.
3.    The US should inform Mubarak that if, after his announcement of these elections, during the transition period, the
Egyptian police engages in acts of political suppression and brutality, the US will vote for a UN resolution and sanctions
against his regimeâ€”and US aid will be contingent on adherence to standards of universal human rights in the UN charter
to which Egypt is a signatory.

Needless to say, the Egyptian revolution augurs an intense focus on the collapse of US initiatives on Israel-Palestine. Be
prepared to take the consequences (while Bibi's government and US neocons bark incessantly about "delegitimation" of
Israel, the PA is actually delegitimatized; plus post-Egyptian revolution, without renewed pressure, the US position will
enter a new cycle of delegitimation in the Arab world from the Bosporus to the Nile), or be prepared with a much
tougher line forcing the process regardless of potential fallout in US 2012 election cycle. In the best possible outcome
now, if we are really lucky, with a freely elected Egyptian government, the US hand will be forced in any case.
