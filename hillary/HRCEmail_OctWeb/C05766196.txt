Hey dear

We're trying to make a good decision here (both in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and time trade-offs) for whether S
should come to Copenhagen and whether her time there would be productive.

Todd sent a memo saying that 1) she should come;                                                                   3)      B5
there were big gaps on matters that negotiation might close (but not a lot of hope).

                                                                                                                           B5

Thanks
