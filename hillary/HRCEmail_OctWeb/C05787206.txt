This sounds right to me and I'm ready to call Baucus and Reid if it would be helpful. Just let me know.

Cheryl — We missed you in LR last weekend. It was such a blast and I am sorry you couldn't make it.

I don't know if you recall, but GPG represents the Embassy of Korea. And I don't know how closely you're
involved in planning for the South Korean President's visit next week, but I know there's a bit of a to-do right
now over his giving a speech before a joint session of Congress.

Turns out Boehner won't agree to it unless the Senate demonstrates movement on the FTAs — i.e. Baucus
does a markup while awaiting House passage of the agreements. Meanwhile, Baucus isn't inclined to do a
markup this week unless Reid can assure him that there will be floor time next week to take up the FTAs (after
they pass the House). And Reid's staff tell us that he's deferring to Baucus on the timing of a markup.

So....if State would like to see the Korean President do a joint session, it sounds like contact with Baucus (and
possibly Reid) to encourage forward movement on an FTA markup would be timely.

Just thought you'd like to know how things look from this vantage point. Susan
