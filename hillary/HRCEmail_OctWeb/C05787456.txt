Let's just do the three standard interviews at State on Monday and figure out how to do the webchat later.

MS -

In trying to build this new media event we've encountered two production/technical issues: 1) you need to be at
Aljazeera's DC studio 2) it needs to be in the 45 minute range. On #2, I know from Huma that you see this as something
that lasts 30 minutes tops. Assuming that's still the case, what I'd do is go back to Al, tell them we can do it there but it
needs to be 30 mins max, otherwise we can't do it. If they say yes, great, if not, we can instead just tape three straight
up interviews with Aljazeera, Alarabiya, Alhurra on Monday, and then work on a simplified new media event for
sometime later in the week - maybe Tuesday tied to the Internet Freedom speech.

We are still working out the technical details, but you'd be sitting with an Aljazeera correspondent (Ibrahim who has
interviews you 3 times and was supposed to on Thursday). He would present the Qs to you, either by reading them to
you, or showing you the recorded question on a monitor. We'd do this in the State studio

MS-

To follow up on our conversation the other day about doing something webby related to Egypt, we'd like to on Monday
set up a session where you answer questions that have been culled through new media (youtube, Twitter, etc). We'd
partner with Aljazeera who would solicit, choose and pose the questions to you.
