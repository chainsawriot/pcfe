Attached and below is Gates Testimony.

Where are we on feedback to you on the Secretary's testimony and once she reviews, I would like to make sure we send
our draft testimony to their COS too as a courtesy.

Jake/Jack:

Please review and flag any issues earlier enough so we can decide if we need to raise them.

All — I am not tracking email so easiest to give me a call (7-5548).

Thanks.
