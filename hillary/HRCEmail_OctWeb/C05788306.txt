What about one of the AIDS groups or individual who appreciates her work in China?

Do you have any ideas regarding anyone who might want to help her whom we could approach?

Importance: High

Dear Susan and Wenchi,

        home care arrangement is in the process of falling through,




                                                                                           to start thinking about
finding money for hired home health aides if that should become necessary.




The ideal solution would be for the secretary to direct me to somebody with the resources to take on the financial side
of this responsibility. I can manage the rest.

Can you take this up with her?

Any questions, give me a call â€”

Cheers,

Andy
