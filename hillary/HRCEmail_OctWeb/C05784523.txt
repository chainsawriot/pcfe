Subject: really smart Rhodes scholar

Jake and Cheryl,
I'm attaching the cv of a very talent young woman who is currently finishing her D.Phil on a Rhodes scholarship (she is
the one who wrote a very smart analysis of Cyprus that I sent you a while back). As people may be shifting jobs, or
starting new ones (Rick Barlett?), she's a real talent. I think she'd come to work pretty much whenever you need her.
Best,
AM
