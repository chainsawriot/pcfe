The Secretary's Phone Calls with Japanese, ROK, Chinese and Russian Foreign Ministers
                                 Monday, May 25, 2009


Purpose: To reach out to Japan, South Korea, China and Russia following the probable May 24
DPRK nuclear test.

    • A nuclear test by North Korea, if confirmed, would be a provocative act and an
      unequivocal violation of UNSCR 1718, blatantly disregarding the will of the international
      community.

    • We have remained united in the face of the DPRK's provocations, and we need to
      maintain this unity among the Six-Party partners. The DPRK's message to us in advance
      of the test, which blamed the UNSC's "failure to apologize for its Presidential
      Statement," demonstrates the degree to which the DPRK has isolated itself. Now is the
      right time for a Five-Party meeting to demonstrate our unity.

    • It is essential that the UN Security Council take strong measures to clearly demonstrate
      that the DPRK's actions will have consequences. The United States believes that it is
      essential that the Security Council issue a swift statement condemning the DPRK's test at
      its initial May 25 emergency meeting. The UNSC should then quickly follow up with a
      strong new Chapter 7 Resolution that includes concrete response measures.
