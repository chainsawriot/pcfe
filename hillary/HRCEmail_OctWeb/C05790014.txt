Absolutely fabulous -- Cheryl's mind moves at the speed of light, as does Laurie's, and I was SO glad to connect
the two of them. Cheryl and she were even wearing the same bracelet -- a gift from Laurie's father to her, and
from Cheryl's mentor to her.

We discussed what SBI is doing in Tunisia, Haiti, Pakistan (where we have 22 Pakistani staff and know the
country very, very well) and Egypt and what we know regarding being poised to act in post-conflict situations.
Cheryl requested a number of follow-ups we'll provide.

We also talked briefly about the impact economy convening and I then met with Lala to review the draft
agenda. I hope you can do one of your working dinners before the event, as you'd really benefit from having this
opportunity before you address the group. Cheryl asked me for a list of suggested guests and I'll get that to her
in the next several days.

Our only sober note was Syria, which is breaking all our hearts. I pray for some breakthrough there.

Great day. So glad we had the chance.

 So sorry I missed seeing you both. How was the meeting?

SBI CEO Laurie Spengler and I are meeting with Cheryl this afternoon. Expect you are booked six ways from
Sunday (as my mother used to say), but would love to give you a grin if possible. You've met Laurie briefly,
and she is a huge fan of your's, so I would be delighted if you had a chance to say hello. I think the world of
her -- she in fact reminds me of you, which is probably why I so relish working with her.

I was thrilled to receive a "save the date" notice for the State Impact Economy event yesterday, and will be
meeting with Lala after seeing Cheryl to go over draft program. It's really gratifying to be involved with Kris
and Lala on this. I've been invited by Government of India and World Bank to speak at a symposium on
scaling social enterprise in India in April, and will spend two weeks in India -- my first trip there since I went
with you back during the Administration!

Holding good thoughts for all you're juggling; trying times.
