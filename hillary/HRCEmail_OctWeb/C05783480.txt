Jake—

So, I just note the WSJ headline from below, suggesting that the Fed might be looking at a third round of quantitative
easing focused on the mortgage market. Not to give our POTUS jobs memo too much (any?) credit, but this was an idea
that was in there, at a time when I couldn't find evidence of anyone talking about it...



      •    Housing Market May Get Fed Aid

           Federal Reserve officials are starting to build a case for a new program of buying mortgage-backed
           securities to boost the ailing economy, though they appear unlikely to move swiftly in this direction.
