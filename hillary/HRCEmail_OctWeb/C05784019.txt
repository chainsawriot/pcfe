Subject: Pakistan's US envoy returns home amid scandal (AP)



ISLAMABAD (AP) - Pakistan's ambassador to the United States says he has returned home to answer questions
about his alleged involvement in a secret memo scandal that threatens his job.
  Ambassador Husain Haqqani says he arrived in Islamabad on Sunday.
  A U.S. citizen of Pakistani origin, Mansoor Ijaz, has accused Haqqani of masterminding a memo sent to a
senior U.S. military official asking for help to rein in the Pakistani military after the U.S. raid that killed Osama
bin Laden in Pakistan in May.
  Haqqani has denied the allegation that he was behind the memo but has offered to resign to end the
controversy.
  The scandal has exacerbated tensions between Pakistan's weak civilian government and its powerful military.
