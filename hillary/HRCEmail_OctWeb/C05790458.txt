Cheryl — Marvin Hamlisch is being considered for a Kennedy Center award. I have heard that Secretary Clinton is a friend
and a fan of his. If she is inclined to weigh in on his behalf, such a letter or call should go to Michael Keyser. I have pasted
below my letter in support of his award. I became a fan of his when we met in The Hague.

Hoping this finds you and Secretary Clinton well.

Kind regards,

Fay




I had the privilege of meeting Marvin Hamlisch in 2009 in the Netherlands when I was serving as Ambassador. He
performed in Amsterdam, to support the John Adams Institute, a foundation dedicated to promoting American
culture in the Netherlands. He did not charge the Institute for his performance, he was generous in his interviews,
and he was not promoting any particular endeavor of his own. He was living his mantra:

"Music can make a difference. There Is a global nature to music, which has the potential to bring all people together.
Music is truly an International language, and I hope to contribute by widening communication as much as I can."

In 2011, he returned again to the Netherlands, performed again gratis, and spent an additional three hours with
students in the American School of The Hague. In telling his life story, in sharing his music, and in composing songs on
the spot, he delighted and thrilled students and adults alike with his joy and creativity in music.
Marvin Hamlisch has been recognized by his peers through Academy Awards, Grammy Awards, Tony Awards, and
Pulitzer Awards for his musical scores and songs. But his contributions as composer, performer and conductor place
him in the rare category of American icon. When a friend mentioned to me that he had never been honored at the
Kennedy Center, I really couldn't believe it and had to research it myself. Having been convinced, I would like to try to
change this omission from Marvin's well-deserved credits as a humanitarian too.

I have the greatest admiration for Marvin Hamlisch (and not just because I love The Way We Were). I admire him
because he lives his values in which he so obviously believes. I hope you can help get this honor for Marvin Hamlisch.
