Dear Evelyn,

We just had a good meeting with the General and his team. I found it very encouraging and I was impressed by the
dignity and care in which General Dailey handled the matter. I will let your team give you their own judgment, but I at
least am feeling more comfortable. We will be meeting later here at the State Department to ensure the event on
Tuesday is handled with the utmost care. The NASM team is very grateful that the expedition has negotiated a provision
in the agreement with Kirabati to publicly display any finds from the expedition. Please let me know what you think. I
know the Secretary will value deeply your views on the best way forward.

Thank you for all you do at the Smithsonian. Washington would not be the same, either for our children or us, without
your wonderful institution.

Best,
Kurt

Just had a very good meeting hour long meeting with the National Geographic guys and the Tighar team. Very
productive and NASM is now very encouraging of the event and the Secretary's role. They are intrigued by the new
evidence and supportive overall of the search -- even if one of their senior team (another searcher) has doubts about
whether we will find her. The General and his team are fully on board with the event as we described it and the
Secretary's proposed role in it (we stressed that this was still undecided) â€” highlighting the 75t h anniversary of her flight,
 our Pacific heritage and a sense of adventure, and a quest to search. We will be careful, and very cautious about the
 prospects in her remarks. They thought that was right. I think they were very impressed by the amount of work and
 corroborating information we had and are appreciative that NASM would be able to display the plane if it is
 discovered. Nora will help set up a call with the General and Cheryl and the General is also sending me a supportive
