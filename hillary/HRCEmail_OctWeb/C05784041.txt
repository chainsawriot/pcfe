Subject: Myanmar said to begin moving political prisoners (AP)

RANGOON (AP) - A Burmese official says authorities have begun transferring some political prisoners from
remote jails to facilities closer to their families in a move that may presage the release of other detainees.
   The Home Ministry official says the transfers included some high-profile prisoners.
   The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release information.
   A government-appointed human rights body urged the Burmese president November 13 to release political
prisoners or transfer them to prisons close to their families, signaling such action may be imminent.
