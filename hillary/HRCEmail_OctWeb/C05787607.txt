  Re: Qaddafi's location


  Seymour Hersh, the investigative journalist for The New Yorker, was approached a source who
  was a former financial beneficiary of the Qaddafi regime within the last 48 hours asking him
  whether he wished to conduct an exclusive interview with fugitive former Libyan dictator
  Muammar Qaddafi, according to a close friend of Hersh. Hersh was told that Qaddafi is in Chad.
  He was also told that Qaddafi intends to wage endless war from his new location. Qaddafi helped
  install the Chad president, Idriss Deby, supporting him when he overthrew Hussein Habre in the
  fall of 1990.
