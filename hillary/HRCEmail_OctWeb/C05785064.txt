interesting model.

Subject: MediaPlanet explanation

Jake and Sheba,

MediaPlanet is a private media company whose business model is summarized in fine print in the supplement you
provided: "Mediaplanet's business is to create new customers for our advertisers by providing readers with high-quality
editorial content that motivates them to act."

Their website (www.mediaplanet.com/about/concept) explains this further.
Q: Why should I work with MediaPlanet?
A: We convert advice-seeking readers and viewers into customers.

In short, they pick sexy topics, pull together inexpensive content, create an attractively produced "media supplement"
that gets bundled into a major paper, sell advertising, and capture the spread between what the newspaper charges
them to distribute the supplement and the advertising revenues they can attract by picking a sexy topic. It looks like the
issue du jour was "Every year, 10 million girls become child brides" — designed to entice readers to open the section.
Because the supplement was truncated, I couldn't find all the advertisers — but one was for an NGO called Women
Thrive Worldwide, at www.womenthrive.org. If you are interested, we can try to dig up the original supplement and
follow up on advertisers, but I'll wait for instructions. Further detail on the business model is described in text from the
mediaplanet website below.

Let me know if this is sufficient or whether you want more?

We find your target groups

Mediaplanet's ambition is to help you retain old customers as well as win new ones. Every time we introduce a paper or
Web-TV production on the market we try to facilitate a positive meeting between our advertisers and readers/viewers.
Initially we identify the information gap: the need for knowledge. We decide upon a theme that appeals to this need, that
communicates efficiently and directly with its targeted audience. Secondly we chose a distribution channel with readers or
visitors that correspond to the current theme. We only partner with papers and online sites that add positive value-based
associations to our products and thus your goods and services. Finally the content of every theme matches both the
needs of our targeted readers/viewers, and the commercial solutions presented to them by our advertisers - you.

Moving the reader/viewer to act
We see every article and Web-TV episode as a business opportunity. Our task is to transform the readers and viewers
into valuable customers, something we do by moving them to act. The transformation process consists of: 1)
Identification, 2) Trust and 3) Action. Initially we identify the reader's and viewer's problem. Based, on this knowledge we
find sources that they can trust. Every story is then carefully constructed to make people want a change, and the
advertisers offer the chance to do just that — change! After reading an article or watching a Web-TV episode the feeling
should be: "I have to do something about this!". It is this feeling that converts the advice-seeking reader and viewer into a
new customer of your company!
