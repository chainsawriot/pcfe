Subject:                            Fw: Kobler's report from MEK/Paris meeting



2 other things I neglected to mention:

1. Kobler's meeting with MEK (Cheryl may have sent this to you) showed the MEK leadership in haggling mode --
summary below.

2. Sarko wants to have an Iran sanctions meeting in Paris on 3 Feb or thereabouts, after the EU announces an embargo.
Tom has his doubts. More as it develops.

Subject: Kobler's report from MEK/Paris meeting

Kobler contacted me to convey highlights of his Paris meetings, which are continuing:

-- much MEK angst and posturing, specifically about Kobler's "betrayal" at having signed the MOU without their
agreement. His answer: lives are at stake, and the GOI met the principles of relocation and repatriation.

  Rajavi claimed that she has lost her grip over the Ashrafis (Kobler doubts that). She asked for a letter from Kobler to
the Ashrafis explaining the MOU (Kobler is preparing it).

- Kobler reviewed the GOI response to the MEK "minimum assurances" demand. He did so (including the GOI insistence
on police presence inside Liberty and no formal revocation of the warrants. The MEK seemed resigned to the Iraqi
police presence, but wants to discuss details (perhaps later). They agree to postpone discussion of property questions.

-- biggest problem is question of safety/ guarantees of those facing arrest (the "120". Kobler explained that UN's ability
to help is limited. (But Fayyad earlier told Kobler and repeated to Jim Jeffrey today that the GOI would not act on the
warrants if the deal were moving forward. We will find a way to convey this to the MEK.)

-- in sum, Rajavi did not reject MOU outright, but is still haggling.
