Subject: Palestinians: 2 dead in clash with Israel (AP)


GAZA CITY (AP) - A Palestinian health official in the Gaza Strip says two Palestinian men have been killed in
clashes with Israeli forces.
   Health Ministry spokesman Adham Abu Salmia says he had no information about the men's identities.
   The Palestinians say gunbattles began after Israeli soldiers entered Palestinian farmland inside northern Gaza.
They say Israeli planes then carried out an airstrike.
   The Israeli military says the clashes began after Palestinian militants fired at soldiers on a routine patrol on
the Gaza-Israel border. It says the soldiers were on Israeli soil.
   The clash mars a brief lull that followed the most serious flare-up in violence in months. At least 10 militants
and an Israeli civilian were killed in the earlier round of fighting.
