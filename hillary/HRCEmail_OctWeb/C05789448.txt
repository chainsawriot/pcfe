 New Public Opinion Survey Findings from Pakistan
 Office of Opinion Research, U.S. Department of State


 A January 2011 Office of Opinion Research survey of Pakistan's four provinces, conducted largely before
 the recent shooting incident in Lahore involving a U.S. embassy employee, finds favorable opinion of the
 U.S. has returned to levels found before flooding struck the country in mid-2010. Favorable opinion had
 increased last fall, likely due in part to U.S. flood relief efforts.

     •   Sixteen percent of Pakistanis now express a favorable view of the United States. Seventy
         percent express an unfavorable view (49% very unfavorable).

     •   The survey was conducted January 9-30, 2011.



                   "Please tell me whether you have a very favorable, somewhat favorable,
                 somewhat unfavorable, or very unfavorable opinion of the United States." (%)
