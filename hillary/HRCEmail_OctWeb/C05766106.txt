MS - A few scheduling items that have come up today:
1. Shaun Woodward would like to see you in person either Monday or Tuesday -- he is essentially flying here for the
meeting. Jake recommends seeing him, I could work in for Tuesday.
2. Madeline Albright is returning from NATO and would like to either schedule a call or see you in person either Monday
or Tuesday prior to your trip to Brussels.
3. Rich just flagged for us that congressional members are being invited to the WH for a briefing on Tuesday 12/1 from
4:45pm-5:45pm, presumably with POTUS.
