Subject: Haqqanis will not talk Afghan peace alone-commander (Reuters)


PESHAWAR (Reuters) - The Afghan Haqqani insurgent network will not take part individually in any peace
talks with the United States and negotiations must be led by the Taliban leadership, a senior commander told
Reuters on Tuesday.

   "They (the Americans) would not be able to find a possible solution to the Afghan conflict until and unless
they hold talks with the Taliban shura," said the Haqqani group commander, referring to the Taliban leadership
council.
