Subject: Mexico names intelligence chief to interior post (AP)

MEXICO CITY - (AP) Mexican President Felipe Calderon has named the former chief of the country's
intelligence agency as the new interior secretary, which is the top domestic security post.
   Harvard-educated former national security spokesman Alejandro Poire replaces Francisco Blake Mora, who
died in a helicopter crash last week on the outskirts of Mexico City.
   Calderon says he chose Poire because of his deep knowledge of security issues and politics.
   Poire will oversee the offensive against drug cartels as well as Mexico's presidential election July 1.
