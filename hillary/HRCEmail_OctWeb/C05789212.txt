FYI — for Julissa — business meeting it today and he has pulled her off it which means mid-March is the next time she
could be considered:

                         The Secretary's Call Sheet for Senator Richard Lugar
                                     Monday, February 13, 2012

Purpose of Call: To ask Senator Lugar to include Julissa Reynoso's nomination in tomorrow's
Senate Foreign Relations Committee business meeting.

Background: Julissa Reynoso is our nominee to be U.S. Ambassador to Uruguay. She
completed her confirmation hearing on February 7 alongside three other WHA nominees. H
understood that she would be added to a February 14 business meeting, pending responses to
all follow-up Questions for the Record (QFRs), which were promptly completed. However,
Senator Lugar's staff on Friday blocked her inclusion due to his objection over what he sees as
a lack of required focus on the U.S.-Uruguay trade relationship. That same day, Lugar sent
additional QFRs, which the Department answered today. H has vigorously engaged Senator
Lugar's staff on this issue, but the Committee has yet to include her nomination on the agenda
for tomorrow's business meeting.

Hi Cheryl,

I understand that S is willing to call Senator Lugar about Julissa's nomination. Lugar's staff sent us a follow up
set of QFRs on Friday, and we sent the responses back to the committee this afternoon. Attached is a call sheet

with some points for S to make to Senator Lugar, should she have time for the call this evening. Please let me
know if you have any questions, or would like to discuss this further.

Thanks,
Josh
