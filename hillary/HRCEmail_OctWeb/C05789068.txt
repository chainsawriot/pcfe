STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON

Sunday's explosions in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo

I was deeply saddened to learn of the loss of life and damage caused by Sunday's explosions at
a munitions depot in Brazzaville. The U.S. Embassy in Brazzaville is in the process of issuing a
disaster declaration that will allow the U.S. to provide emergency assistance and relief to help
the victims of this tragedy. We are working with the Government of the Republic of Congo and
the international community to determine what additional assistance we can provide to the
government and people of Congo. Our thoughts and prayers are with all Congolese people
during this difficult time.
