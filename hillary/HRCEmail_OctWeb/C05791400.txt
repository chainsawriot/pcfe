Dear Kurt--

How are you and the delegation holding up? How will you get out? Is there anything I/US can do? I know Australia is
helping and I have a call into the FM.

Pls tell Wendy Sherman how concerned Barbara Mikulski is for her. I reassured her but Wendy might want to contact
her directly.

Take care, my friend--H

Most of city center badly damaged. NZ declared highest state of emergency. Significant casualties I fear. Kurt

Thanks for call and for concern. Major damage all around. All US accounted for. Working to track down and take care of
all our people. Several buildings down and lots of confusion amid aftershocks. Trying to keep people together and calm.
We will be fine. Best Kurt
