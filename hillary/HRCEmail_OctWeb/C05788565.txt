Subject: DPRK threatens to attack ROK over drills (AP)


SEOUL (AP) - The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has threatened to attack the Republic of
Korea accusing it of planning live-fire drills near their disputed sea border.
   The DPRK military said the ROK planned artillery drills from five front-line islands off the western coast
Feb 20.
   It says the drills are "reckless military provocation" and the DPRK will launch "merciless" strikes if the
training is implemented.
   The DPRK warned people living on the islands to evacuate before the drills start.
