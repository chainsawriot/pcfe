Subject: Cuomo on SSM in State of the State

Gov. Cuomo is about to say the following about marriage equality in his State of the State Address:

For decades, millions of New Yorkers had been treated as second-class citizens by their own government. We ended that
injustice. We stopped the discrimination. We made history. We led the nation. We passed marriage equality for ALL New
Yorkers and we did it together. With this historic victory, New York is the largest state in the nation to grant same-sex
couples the freedom to marry.
