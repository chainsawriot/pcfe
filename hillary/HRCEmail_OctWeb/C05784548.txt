Subject: Hezbollah: Syria largely out of 'danger zone' (AP)



BEIRUT (AP) - The leader of the militant group Hezbollah says the regime in Syria is largely "out of the
danger zone" despite a 7-month-old uprising against President Bashar Assad.
   Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah's comments Monday appeared to be an attempt to portray
confidence that the Assad regime will survive.
   Hezbollah is one of Syria's strongest allies, but the group has struggled to respond to the regime's bloody
crackdown on protests.
  Nasrallah has largely supported the Arab uprisings, saying Egypt, Tunisia and even Libya were too close to
the U.S.
   Syria's crackdown also appears to be eroding Hezbollah's reputation. At recent protests, Syrian protesters also
unleashed their anger at Hezbollah over its blunt support for the regime.
