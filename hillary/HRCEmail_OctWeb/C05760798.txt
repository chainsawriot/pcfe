We can certainly switch flights -- the one thing to raise on Monday is that there is now a 4:45-5:15pm meeting at the WH
which appears to be solid despite the fact Mitchell is traveling. It is my understanding



Would you like to attend this meeting? If so we should take the 3pm shuttle that afternoon ...
