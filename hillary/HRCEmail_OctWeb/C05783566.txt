Subject: Release: Over 100 American Mayors Voice Concern on Keystone XL Tar Sands Pipeline


Good morning,

Yesterday, over 100 mayors wrote to President Obama expressing concerns about the impacts of the Keystone
XL tar sands pipeline on communities and local efforts to reduce US dependence on oil. The mayors thank the
President for the new review, but remain convinced that a full, fair review can yield only one answer: the
Keystone XL tar sands pipeline is not in the nation's best interest.

Specifically, 103 mayors from 28 states, including 10 capital cities reflecting a combined population of over 9
million Americans wrote: "Expansion of high carbon fuels such as tar sands undermine hard work by local•
communities everywhere to fight climate change, reduce dependence on oil, and create a clean energy future
... We ask that you find that the proposed Keystone XL tar sands pipeline is not in the national interest and
deny its permit."

You will find a link to the letter and a list of the mayors in the blog below:

Posted: Over 100 Mayors Voice Concern Over Keystone XL Tar Sands Pipeline
In the wake of a decision to do a new review of the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline, 103 American mayors sent
a letter expressing concerns about the impacts to communities of the pipeline to President Barack
Obama. President Obama is listening to concerns from all across America about the proposed Keystone XL
tar sands pipeline, and now mayors from coast-to-coast are weighing in. Mayors are at the frontlines of
reducing our dependence on oil and have been working to create a more efficient system because they take
climate change seriously. The mayors took this action to demonstrate the widespread support that exists
among local communities across the country for rejecting the proposed pipeline. The letter underscores the
importance of carrying out a new, in-depth review of the project that includes a careful look at the project's
impact on our nation's climate change goals and on the efforts of local communities across the country to •
reduce our demand for oil. The mayors thank the President for the new review, but remain convinced that a
full, fair review can yield only one answer: the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline is not in the nation's best
interest. Read more at:
