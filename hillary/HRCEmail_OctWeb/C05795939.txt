Subject: Article: At the Pinnacle of Hillary Clinton's Career

This is a wonderful piece on Secretary Clinton! I am pleased beyond words that journalists and others are
finally seeing what we have known all along... that Secretary Clinton is brilliant, sincere, committed and an
extraordinary visionary and advocate for under-served persons all over the world.

Keep up the great work!
