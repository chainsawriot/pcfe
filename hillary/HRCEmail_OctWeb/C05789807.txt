We are also getting better vibes from Gates since your chat w Bill Gates. Julia Roberts and Melinda spoke last week and
we got word from CDC that Gates may want to investigate this again. (Gabrielle - mentioned in the email below is a
friend and frmr WJC Admin speechwriter).

More good signals from Alliance. Don't know if this meeting will come to us separately or not, but we are clearly
affecting things.


This email is UNCLASSIFIED.

Our approach from all fronts seems to be working. Kate just told me that during the UNF - Gates semi-annual
confab last week, Gabrielle Fitzgerald who is Interim Director for Global Health Policy & Advocacy mentioned that
they want to have a another meeting with us in the near future to discuss stoves. Kate is working to schedule
it. Apparently Melinda Gates sat next to Julia Roberts at an event in LA last week and discussed stoves at
length!! Wish I could have been a fly on that wall.
