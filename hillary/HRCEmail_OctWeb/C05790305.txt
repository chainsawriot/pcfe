Subject: Slavery Footprint just won big advertising award

Last week, the Slavery Footprint won the Andy International Award for Website. The Andy Awards are an international
competition honoring advertising, including social media campaigns. A very good overview of the impact of the site, and
the very impressive media penetration that has happened, is contained in this short video:

As always, thank you all for your support of this. We've gotten a huge bang for very small investment.
