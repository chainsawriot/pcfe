Subject: USAID contractor work in Cuba detailed (AP)

  WASHINGTON (AP) - Reports written by American aid contractor Alan Gross detail secret work he carried
out in Cuba before his arrest there in 2009.

  An Associated Press review of the reports shows that Gross was setting up uncensored satellite Internet
service for Cuba's Jewish community.

  The operation was funded under a U.S. Agency for International Development democracy promotion
program. Gross identified himself as a member of a Jewish humanitarian group, not a U.S. government
representative.

  Another document reviewed by the AP shows that on his final trip Gross installed a specialized mobile phone
chip to make satellite signals virtually impossible to track.

  Gross was sentenced to 15 years in prison for seeking to "undermine the integrity and independence" of
Cuba.
