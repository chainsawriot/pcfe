                 SPECIAL PAKISTAN MEDIA ANALYSIS: DEATH OF BIN LADEN (II)
                                       May 2, 2011

Ten hours after the announcement of Bin Laden's death, the tone and tenor of Pakistani broadcast media
remains relatively positive. Nevertheless, some in the media are focusing on the Pakistani government's role
(or lack thereof) in the operation and criticizing it for allowing a U.S. operation on its soil. Nearly all TV
networks replayed clips from President Obama's announcement on hourly news bulletins. None of the TV
outlets openly expressed sympathy for Bin Laden. The only known exceptions were Hamid Mir, the host of
"Capital Talk" on Geo and Javaid Chaudhry, an anchor on Express TV, who called him "Shaheed"
(martyr). Later in the afternoon, TV networks reported that an alleged Taliban spokesman has threatened to
target Pakistani politicians, including President Zardari and the Pakistan Army, to avenge Bin Laden's death.

Media highlighted the reactions of Prime Minister Gilani and the Foreign Office, particularly PM Gilani's
remarks that Bin Laden's killing was a "great victory," and the Foreign Office's comment that it represents "a
major setback to terrorist organizations around the world." However, the headlines of the online versions of
mass-circulation Urdu daily "Jang" and its English counterpart "The News" read "Pakistan Says U.S.
Conducted Operation" and point to the fact that statement distances the Pakistani Army from the attack by
calling it solely "an American military operation."

Many analysts have criticized the government of Pakistan over Bin Laden's presence in the country and the
U.S. operation for taking place without Pakistan's permission. Senior defense analyst Dr. Riffat Hussain
summed up the public indignation in a Dawn TV program by saying that the discovery that Bin Laden was in
Pakistan "is a collective national embarrassment and shame." Former President Musharraf remarked that the
"Pakistan Army should have conducted this operation." Dawn News TV also showed clips of reaction from the
streets. Most of those interviewed expressed anger that Palcistani "rulers sold us out" to the U.S., complaining
that "we are fighting a proxy war," and that "foreign troops can enter into Pakistan and can conduct operations
without our permission."
