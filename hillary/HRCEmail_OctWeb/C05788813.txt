Subject: Taliban says won Rabbani trust in order to kill him (Reuters)

KABUL,    Sept 20 (Reuters) - The Taliban said on Tuesday it had won assassinated former Afghan president
Burhanuddin Rabbani's trust by using a high-level team that feigned interest in talks but instead was intent on
killing him.

   A Taliban suicide bomber on Tuesday killed Rabbani, head of a council that was trying to negotiate a
political end to the war, in what analysts called a blow to peace efforts.


   Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed responsibility, saying the killer had gone to Rabbani's home
for talks.

   "As soon as Rabbani came three steps forward to hug Mohammad Masoom, he triggered his explosive-filled
jacket killing Rabbani, (another) Taliban militant Wahid Yar and four security guards present at the house," he
told Reuters.

   The Kabul police chiefs office, in a statement, said the explosives had been hidden in the suicide bomber's
turban.

  Mujahid said the Taliban's central leadership had appointed two "articulate and well-trained" fighters --
Masoom and Yar -- to build contacts with Rabbani.

  He also told Reuters that Yar, a former minister when the Taliban were in power in Kabul, had visited
Rabbani's home many times.

   "Both of them were frequently meeting him at his Kabul home and secured trust of Rabbani and his guards.
They were telling Rabbani that they would soon bring senior Taliban leadership to the negotiating table with
him," Mujahid said by phone from an undisclosed location.

   The Taliban frequently exaggerates battlefield exploits, but Mujahid's statements seemed to broadly match
other accounts of the assassination.

    Mujahid said the group had made similar plans for assassinating "more such people" in the near future.

   Rabbani's assassination comes after a string of high profile killings, including President Hamid Karzai's
brother and top northern police commander General Dawood Dawood.
