This is from an Egyptian with whom we worked closely over many years. Makes me sad, I wish I knew what to do. I am
going to organize a meeting with some of the key women in the region to see how we can be useful.




Dear Melanne,
We have not been in contact                    and much has happened some positive other disquieting and
worrying develments. I heard                   hat Hillary Clinton had warned in her speech for              rch for
Egypt to preserve its gains in women s empowerment. Alas this is not the case. Ten years of                  work is
down the drain. The ministry has been abolished it is now back under the ministry of Health including the w
Family and rhilri rrmnril The rhild marlage law that was raised to 18 is now in process of bring repealed,
                                          FGM is next, etc. All the work which you and i were so proud of is being
attaked as a western agenda and our pioneering work in the rights of the child is cpmpromised and now being
represented by a man who knows nothing         this was Ahmed Aboul Gheit's last contribution before bring
ousted don't we know his views and the headche we had with him.
               ailed me and wants to do something. She is appalled and i don't know whether we should not have
a con erence call which i can arrange to discuss what we can do and how. cNN is wonderful with me and i could
maybe organize a round table or our friend. Christianne Ananpour in her program. I also had Emma Bonino and
all of us are worried sick. As you know the killer of Sadat was released by the authorities his beard is down to his
knees and as an axtreme fudamentalist he is back on the spotlight.call me if you can.....it is my turn to turn to you
for suggestions! There is now a strong extremist movement and with Japan's disaster there is almost nothing on
the news of terrible steps occuring elsewhere which will turn the clock back...
