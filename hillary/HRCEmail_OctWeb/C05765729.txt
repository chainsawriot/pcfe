Fyi from Ching. You made everyone feel good as always. Interesting re: Mrs. Karzai. When I met with him, he told me he
could not have her do public things even tho she complained about that. Maybe he's had a change of heart.

I just lefta very late dinner with            She sends her love and follows everything you do from afar. I'm glad I got    B6
to see her before heading back very early tomw.

It's fascinating to be back. King is really moving forward -- so much positive change. Met with a group of women leaders,
including many of our friends from family code reform and with Islam's version of Mother Theresa -- an amazing woman.
All report steady progress.

OECD summit was impressive. The MENA businesswomen were happy we validated their efforts but it's still so hard for
women to make even economic gains in some of their countries.

Dear Mellane, Good Morning!

Hope this e-mail find you well and vibrant as always!

As you know, we had a 'surprise' visitor last Wednesday and Thursday. I got an
opportunity to get to know her closed-up, and found her such a warm and approachable
person! No wonder you spoke so highly of her!

Her visit was, as you can imagine, busy and intense; but she managed to spend time
with embassy employees and the troops, on top of meeting with Mr. Karzai and his
cabinet. It was extremely successful in every way at this turning point of Afghanistan's
history.

As you know, Mellane, Afghan's younger females are getting more and more connected
with the outside world, and they need a role model desperately. I have been trying to
befriend with Mrs. Karzai and invited her to be more involved and more visible. Just last
week, I brought 4 bento boxes to her residence with Chinese food in them, and she sent
back some Afghan sweets that she made with a letter saying it is Afghan's tradition not
to send back empty boxes. She also expressed that she is ready to be more involved
and help her husband to establish a positive image. I am thrilled and can't wait to tell
you this good news! I also thought it would be a great idea if both Mrs. Obama and Mrs.
Karzai can join our US-AFG Women's Council as honorary members to help promote our
programs. I drafted two letters to Mrs. Obama and                to express my intention                                    B6
and had Allyson Salyer, who is currently TDY in Kabul and familiar with the council, to

check the protocol and procedures.


Before Secretary Clinton left Kabul, she invited Karl to go along with her to the US, so I
gave Karl the letters for him to pass on to                   Mrs. Obama, provided if the
council agrees it is appropriate to invite them to join. I haven't heard from
Allyson yet, so if you could look into it, it would be very helpful.




Before Secretary's team left, I asked Huma to bring you a sky-blue scarf from our store
(which unfortunately is not made by          family. They can't produce fast enough so
our residence manager added a few commercial ones. They are very pretty though. Did
you notice the dark red one the Secretary wore during Mr. Karzai's ceremony? Yours is
the same kind). I am sure you will receive it in a few days.

Attached are a few pictures of               our little store. The young woman with
Secretary Clinton is

Last but not least, please convey our Holiday greetings to your family, Mellane. Take
care.
