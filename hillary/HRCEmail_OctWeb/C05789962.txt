Subject: Readout of Tantawi meeting

This is a follow up from my earlier email. We will pull together in cable tomorrow.



We have a readout of the Tantawi meeting with the political parties from a participant. . The group will reconvene on
Thursday mid-day. Tantawi called in about 15-18 political party figures, to focus on the constituent assembly. SCAF
told those gathered it was important to move beyond the crisis, start a dialogue and show Egyptians they can find a
solution. The SCAF was politely showing the FJP that it had gone too far. Liberals complained they had been shut out
of the process. In the end, it seemed as if the FJP was looking at what they might do to allay fears about the
constitution. The elections for the constitutional assembly were over, so there was no going back on that. But options
on the table — which we have heard from other liberals — would be endorsing a "bill of rights" to be incorporated into
the constitution. Participants seemed pleased that the SCAF was playing a positive role. More meetings to follow.

Another idea is taking shape of the idea of a trip for a broad group of parliamentary leaders to the US in a "getting to
know you" visit. We will pursue that.
