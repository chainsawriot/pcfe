 New data released Monday by the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) underscore a call by
 Secretary of State Hillary Clinton earlier this month to harness new science to curb the global HIV/AIDS
 pandemic.


 The number of people living with HIV continues to grow, yet tools to control the pandemic are now at hand — and
 the UNAIDS World AIDS Day Report 2011 shows how they can — when applied — reduce the number of new
 infections.


 An estimated 34 million people were living with HIV in 2010, up from 32.9 million in 2009, according to the
 UNAIDS report. The number continues to grow because more people become infected every year and a growing
 number are gaining access to drugs that help them live longer.

But the data also show that while the number of new infections has hovered around 2.7 million people globally
every year since 2007, it is falling in 33 countries — 22 of them in sub-Saharan Africa, the region that bears the
brunt of the AIDS pandemic.


In her speech earlier this month, Clinton said that recent research and modeling show that combining HIV-
prevention methods such as putting more infected people on AIDS drugs earlier, circumcising men and giving
more medicines to prevent the transmission of HIV from a mother to a child can dramatically reduce infections.


"We know now we can reduce new infections," UNAIDS Executive Director Michel Sidibe tells the Health Blog.
"Even in this time of financial crisis, we're seeing results."


Now it's time to step up the effort after a "game-changing year," Sidibe says.


Publication of a landmark study in May showed that AIDS drugs, known as antiretrovirals, not only restore HIV-
infected people to health, but also make them far less infectious. Those put on treatment early in their infection
were at least 96% less likely to transmit the virus to their sexual partners than those who started on drugs later.
The drugs sharply suppress the amount of HIV in the body, leaving less to transmit.


Botswana offers one example of the benefits of widespread treatment, according to the report. The first African
country to implement a free national antiretroviral therapy program, it has had more than 90% of eligible infected
people on AIDS drugs since 2009. Modeling data suggest that the number of new HIV infections is 30% to 50%
lower now than it would have been without such widespread coverage levels, the report says.


AIDS organizations said the UNAIDS findings demonstrate the need to move quickly to take advantage of the
new science. "We have be strategic and take advantage of this unique opportunity," Chris Collins, vice president
and director of public policy for amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research, tells the Health Blog.


Officials like Sidibe are battling a decline in global funding to combat HIV/AIDS, however. While the cost of
treating infected individuals has declined sharply, new injections of cash will still be necessary to put large
numbers of infected people on drugs.


About 6.6 million people in low- and middle-income countries were on AIDS drugs in 2010, an increase of more
than 1.35 million over the previous year, according to UNAIDS.


Governments' contributions to the fight against AIDS dropped 9.7% in 2010, according to the Kaiser Family
Foundation and UNAIDS, and U.S. funding for global AIDS for fiscal 2011, including the U.S. contribution to the
Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, was about $28 million less than for fiscal 2010. The U.S. is
the world's largest AIDS donor.


One hopeful sign, Sidibe says, is that countries with high AIDS burdens, such as South Africa, are spending more
of their own money on fighting the pandemic.
