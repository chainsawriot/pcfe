Ambassadors:

I went to the NYT dinner this evening iho Bill Keller. Guests included Chairman of the Dawn [media] Group (and brother
of the PK PermRep at the UN), Islamabad Bureau Chief for the Jang/Express [media] group, Time Magazine, Associated
Press, Reuters, ABC-TV, BBC World Service, McClatchy/The Guardian, and eminent [liberal, i.e., pro-American] pundits
like                   and (former                                                                    as well as senior
bureaucrats, a smattering of socialites, and others.

All agreed that Secretary Clinton hit a home run with her public program.                said, "The mother-in-law
moment [at the town hall] was iconic because everyone saw that her delight and laughter were genuine. Everyone said,
'Oh, she's like us! She understands us!'                          said, "Two words reverberated in her press conference
with Foreign Minister Khar: respect and sovereignty. You found the right vocabulary. Across the board, everyone [in
this admittedly liberal gathering] agreed that Secretary Clinton was genuine and honest."

The dissenting voice was                                                                         Folding his napkin ever
smaller, he said, "Every time you say something awful about us in public, you diminish the [military] space we have to
work with you. Even when we want to help, you work against us. You reduce our space to work together every time
you make us look bad.lf you want us to be your enemy, as Bruce Reidel wrote; then simply tell us. We know how to
adjust without you."

I want to emphasize that this was a liberal group, disposed to be pro-American. But these were also the voices of
influence who want to be pro-American but have in recent months felt besieged.

One thing that was remarkable to me was that no one sidled up for a read-out on the core areas of substance
conflict. All — to a woman and man — raved about the Secretary's perfect pitch in her public engagements.
