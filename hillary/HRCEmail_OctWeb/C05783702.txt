Votes will be late today our time in both IAEA and NY. We'll have a statement teed up.

Wendy wanted to make sure you saw the below report on Amano:

VIENNA (Reuters) - The head of the UN nuclear watchdog said November 17 he had proposed sending a special mission
to Iran to address concerns about possible military dimensions to the country's atomic work.

   International Atomic Energy Agency chief Yukiya Amano said he had written to a top Iranian nuclear official to suggest
the visit which would address issues raised: by his latest report on Iran.

   "I hope a suitable date can be agreed soon. It is essential that any such mission should be well planned and that it
should address the issues contained in my report," Amano told an IAEA Board of Governors meeting in Vienna.
