Subject: MEK agrees to next resident's convoy

All â€”

UN head of mission in Iraq Martin Kobler just conveyed that the MEK has (finally) agreed to the next convoy of 400
Ashraf residents to Camp Hurriya/Liberty, starting tomorrow. We have had false starts before on this convoy, so caution
is still in order. But this time the MEK says Rajavi has given the order. Kobler has conveyed this news to the GOI, so
danger of an immediate breakdown of the MOU formula is averted.

This tentative good news follows three days of intense negotiations by Kobler, with Jim Jeffrey and myself weighing in
with the GOI and the MEK, respectively.

I will report developments as they take place.

DF
