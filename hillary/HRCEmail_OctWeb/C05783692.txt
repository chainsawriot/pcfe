Subject: TransCanada, Nebraska to work on new Keystone route (Reuters)

LINCOLN, Neb, (Reuters) - Nebraska and TransCanada Corp agreed November 14 to fmd a new route for the
stalled Keystone XL pipeline that would steer clear of environmentally sensitive lands in the state.

   Under pressure from green groups, the U.S. State Department last week ordered the company to find a new
route for the line in a decision that set back the $7 billion, Canada-to-Texas pipeline by more than a year.
