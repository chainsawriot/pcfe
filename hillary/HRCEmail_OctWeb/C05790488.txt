It is the top academic honor other than being in the National Academy of Sciences; they also have a small and very elite
category for public servants. There is a beautiful Japanese style building in Cambridge where it is headquartered; they
run study groups and projects on important academic and policy issues. You can be a member of a study group without
being a member of the Academy, but they are run by members of the Academy. I don't think there are dues; they
publish the magazine Daedalus which you get for free. But really, it's all about the honor of the thing. They have an
elaborate induction ceremony at some point in the fall, but unless you wanted to give a speech there, I doubt you would
go. I'll send you the list of people admitted this year. I just love the idea of being fellow members.

I had no idea. What a nice surprise. What does it mean? And can you use to facilities for events? Meals? Are there dues?
I am, as you can tell, quite clueless.

Welcome to the august ranks of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. I am proud to be a fellow member! I'm
looking forward to your being back in New York next year so that we can do at least some projects together.
All best,
AM
