Subject:                          Thank you for the clarification



Dear Eric--

Huma passed on your email and I thank you for clarifying the Bhutanese refugee situation. I was clearly confused by the
contradiction btw Bhutan's desire to pursue "Gross Domestic Happiness" and their exclusion of refugees from that
formula.

I'm pleased you think the House and Senate consults went well. We can only hope that's reflected in budget numbers. I
will miss you next year!

All the best, H
