Public-Private Alliance for Responsible Minerals Trade

Fact Sheet
Office of the Spokesperson
Washington, DC

November 15, 2011




Today, the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development and a coalition of private sector
partners, civil society, and other organizations, launched the Public-Private Alliance for Responsible Minerals Trade (PPA)
in Washington, DC. The PPA is part of ongoing U.S. efforts to help the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other
governments in the region break the link between the illicit minerals trade and the ongoing violence and human rights
abuses. The U.S. government is working with Congolese partners, the private sector and civil society to help ensure
responsible trade in minerals that does not benefit rebel groups or abusive army units.

The PPA combines the financial and technical resources of the U.S. government, companies, trade associations and civil
society to assist with the development of pilot supply chain systems that will allow businesses to source minerals from
mines that have been audited and certified to be conflict-free. The alliance will provide a platform for coordination
among government, industry, and civil society actors seeking to support conflict-free,sourcing from the DRC.

The U.S. Department of State and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) will invest approximately $3.2
million in the PPA, specifically to support conflict-free minerals certification and traceability. More than 25 companies,
trade associations, and other organizations have expressed their intention to join the PPA and have already pledged
over $830,000 toward the goal of $2 million in additional funding by the end of 2012.

Public-Private Alliance for Responsible Minerals Trade (PPA)
Leaders worldwide are calling for action to address conflict minerals concerns while delivering
solutions that benefit those involved in responsible minerals trade in Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) and the Great Lakes Region (GLR) of Central Africa. The PPA is being launched as a joint
effort of the U.S. State Department, the U.S. Agency for International Development, non-governmental
organizations and companies/industry organizations to take on this challenge.
The PPA will be a hub for those seeking information and ways to take action on responsible minerals
trade and sourcing, maximizing the efficiency and impact of participants' time and resources, and
generating additional resources to fill key gaps for a verifiable, conflict-free supply chain.
What will the PPA accomplish?
Conflict-free Sourcing. The PPA will demonstrate that it is possible to secure legitimate, conflict-free minerals
from the DRC and the GLR. While initiatives have shown progress, none has yet produced a fully validated supply
chain to meet the needs of companies facing new legislation and international due diligence guidance. The PPA will
support pilot programs—with the ultimate goal of producing scalable, self-sustaining systems—to demonstrate
a fully traced and validated supply chain in a way that is credible to companies, civil society, and government.
Credible Information Resources. The PPA website will be a resource
for companies with reporting requirements mandated by section                    PPA Goals

How will PPA align with other conflict minerals activities?
The PPA will help   coalesce and strengthen existing sourcing mechanisms rather than create new initiatives,
marshaling technical and financial resources to support systems showing early progress (OECD and UN Group of
Experts due diligence guidance and implementation, ICGLR certification system, ITRI Supply Chain Initiative, BGR
Certified Trading Chains). The PPA will provide opportunities to interface and coordinate with governments,
supply chain initiatives, and other stakeholders, serving as a focal point for dialogue and problem-solving.
Who should join? We seek broad participation!
Companies, industry associations, governments, and bi-lateral and multi-lateral development agencies
seeking solutions to address the conflict minerals issues, and looking to work with suppliers, government, and civil
society may join the PPA and are asked to contribute funding.
Civil society and other interested organizations interested in supporting on-the-ground solutions to conflict
minerals sourcing and related issues and able to offer time and expertise to the PPA are also encouraged to join.
