Dear David--

  Thx, as always, for your persistent and excellent work as the Quartet Envoy, especially your recent successful efforts to
postpone the Berlin meeting. We faced steep formidable odds, but you carried the day. Now, we have to--once again--
try to make positive use of the time you bought for us all.

 Thanks so much--H
