Dear Burns,

I'd love to catch up with you and Karen....days have a way of turning into weeks and months....hope you are doing
well...but that's not the reason I'm writing this time.




                              and they have contacted their Congressmar                who is attempting to get State
Department help for the family. I don't have any idea how much clout this gentleman has â€” just because I've never
heard of him doesn't mean others haven't. All of that to say, do you have any pull or any suggestions how to get State
quickly involved? I don't know how responsive they are to such issues, or how many lower-level folks you have to plow
through to get to someone who can make things happen.

There's my "favor" request ..... ..if you tell me you can't do anything or don't recommend we go down that road, I FULLY
understand. Just putting out feelers on behalf of my dear friend....

Blessings to you...
Kay
