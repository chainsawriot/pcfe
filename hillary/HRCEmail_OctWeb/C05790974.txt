                    STATEMENT OF THE UNITED STATES
                      FOLLOWING THE RESIGNATION
                    OF PRIME MINISTER GARRY CONILLE

The United States has welcomed the effort, insight and energy Prime Minister Garry Conille
has demonstrated in the past four months as he dedicated himself to improving conditions
for the people of Haiti. We regret that Haiti will lose his service as Prime Minister.

We urge the Executive branch and the Parliament to work together swiftly to identify and
confirm a new Prime Minister. We continue to believe that political stability in Haiti is
critical to its ability to attract the domestic and foreign investments needed to increase
economic development and create jobs in Haiti.

The Executive, Parliament and other governmental parties need to ensure continuity of
governance and commitment to democratic values by rapidly confirming a new Prime
Minister, holding Parliamentary and local elections this spring, continuing the fight against
corruption, and ensuring that the rights of all Haitians are respected under the rule of law.
