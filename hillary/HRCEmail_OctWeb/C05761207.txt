Does this mean no Thursday mtg? Jones called me about Monday so I emailed Lona and Huma to be sure I could move
other stuff around. Haven't heard back yet.

Any more news from Kabul?

Robert and Cheryl —




Want to thank you for taking time out of Friday to come by for lunch. I found it very useful — not to mention very
pleasant.




As promised, I wanted to follow up with the results of our internal meeting today.
