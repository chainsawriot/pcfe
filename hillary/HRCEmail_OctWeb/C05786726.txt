Shades of Hillary Clinton
By MAGGIE HABERMAN I 8/15/11 3:46 PM EDT

Ben Smith, who helpfully provided feeds from the Iowa State Fair earlier in the day, makes a smart catch on Rick
Perry's line from Waterloo about the wrinkles in his shirt not being his wife's fault:
          The line rang a bell, but I couldn't place it until this morning: It was what the overtly sexist talk radio kids
          who stood up in a New Hampshire town hall meeting yelled at Hillary Clinton, helping to feed a sympathetic
          surge toward her in the state. They were chanting, "Iron my shirt."
         "Ah, the remnants of sexism â€” alive and well," Clinton responded.
             Republican primary politics are obviously quite different from the Democrats', but it seems like an area
             where Perry may have to modulate his approach a bit.


Even within the frame of Republican primaries, one of Perry's two chief rivals is a woman, and the matrix is a bit
different.
