 NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - U.S. Rep. Donald Payne of New Jersey has died at age 77.
   Payne's brother, William, says he died Tuesday morning at St. Barnabas Hospital.
   The 12-term member of the House had announced in February that he was undergoing treatment for colon
cancer and would continue to represent his district.
   Payne was New Jersey's first black congressman.
   Payne has represented the 10th District in northern New Jersey since 1988 and was elected to a 12th term in
2010. He was a member of House committees on education and foreign affairs. He had also served as chairman
of the House subcommittee on Africa.
