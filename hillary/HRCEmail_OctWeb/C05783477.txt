Off the record? Looks like a vanity trip. But the Libyans will love it.

I think we're getting there. Attached is our rough cut at a full two-day schedule. We are now working off of longer flight
times because the aircraft has shifted from a C-17 to a C-130 (though not confirmed). Please note that you may be able
to recover some time throughout the schedule, as we have taken wild guesses at the travel times (when we didn't know
what they were).

In our conversation this evening, the visitor reinforced her interest in ensuring that she saw more of what is happening
in the country. As a result, we have proposed a visit to a detention facility. (We mention Jdeida by name in the
schedule, but we are not wed to that facility. This idea was discussed very early on.) We also have proposed doing that
site visit immediately after the joint press
