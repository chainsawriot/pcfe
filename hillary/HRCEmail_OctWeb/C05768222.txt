Here is the Potus statement we are releasing:

THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary




FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

April 10, 2010



Statement by President Obama on the death of Polish President Lech Kaczynski and those travelling with him

Today, I called Polish Prime Minister Tusk to express Michelle's and my deepest condolences to the people of Poland on
the tragic deaths this morning of President Lech Kaczynski, First Lady Maria Kaczynski, and all who were traveling with
them to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Kaczynski
family, the loved ones of those killed in this tragic plane crash, and the Polish nation.



Today's loss is devastating to Poland, to the United States, and to the world. President Kaczynski was a distinguished
statesman who played a key role in the Solidarity movement, and he was widely admired in the United States as a leader
dedicated to advancing freedom and human dignity. With him were many of Poland's most distinguished civilian and
military leaders who have helped to shape Poland's inspiring democratic transformation. We join all the people of
Poland in mourning their passing.



Today, there are heavy hearts across America. The United States cherishes its deep and abiding bonds with the people
of Poland. Those bonds are represented in the strength of our alliance, the friendships among our people, and the
extraordinary contributions of Polish-Americans who have helped to shape our nation.

It is a testament to the strength of the Polish people that those who were lost were travelling to commemorate a
devastating massacre of World War II as the leaders of a strong, vibrant, and free Poland. That strength will ensure that

Poland emerges from the depths of this unthinkable tragedy, and that the legacy of the leaders who died today will be a
light that continues to guide Poland — and the world — in thoe direction of human progress.
