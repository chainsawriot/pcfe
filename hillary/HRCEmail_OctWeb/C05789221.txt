Subject: Brazil to fine companies for low female pay (AP)

 BRASILIA (AP) - Discriminating against women in Brazil is already illegal. Now it may be very costly as
well.
   Brazil's Congress has passed a bill imposing fines on companies paying women lower wages than men for the
same work. The measure approved Tuesday is expected to be signed into law by Brazil's first female president,
Dilma Rousseff.
  Fines can be as much as five times the cumulative difference in the salaries during the entire time a woman is
employed by a company.
   The Brazilian government's statistics agency has found that on average, women earn only 70 percent of what
their male counterparts take home.
   The bill is authored by congressman Marcal Filho, who says businesses won't take the wage-gap issue
seriously without penalties.
