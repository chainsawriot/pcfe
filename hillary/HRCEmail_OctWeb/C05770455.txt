Colleagues,

Forwarding on a confirmation that Turkish FM Davutoglu will travel to Iran, in a reversal of an earlier decision to turn the
trip off. Davutoglu and Amorim plan to meet with Moutaki on Sunday. PM Erdogan's travel to Iran is still off, but it
looks like it is still a possibly. This reported by Embassy Ankara in the email chain below.

Best regards,

Walter

Sinirlioglu confirmed earlier reports of Davut travel, but interestingly
Did not mention Lula. Sinirlioglu indicated that they did not have anything new from Iranian side. Plan is for Davut and
Amorin to meet with Moutaki Sunday AM. "If the Iranians have something new" then Erdogan will travel to Teheran
Otherwise he will not. S confrimed Davut was fully aware of US position passed him by Secretary.

We finally reached Davutoglu's chef de cabinet in Istanbul. He confirmed that Davutoglu will/will travel to Tehran. We were
told to pass on that the purpose is to "give it one more shot."
