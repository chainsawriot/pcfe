Subject: Haitian Prime. Minister Conille abruptly resigns post (AP)

PORT-AU-PRINCE (AP) - A Haitian government official says that Prime Minister Garry Conille has abruptly
resigned.
   The official tells The Associated Press that Conille submitted a two-sentence letter of resignation after less
than five months in office. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not yet authorized to
release the information. No successor has been named.
   Conille was ratified by the Haitian parliament in October. He was President Michel Martelly's third nominee
for the post after the two previous picks failed to win support from lawmakers.
   Conille is a physician who previously served as an aide to Bill Clinton in the former U.S. President's role as
U.N. envoy to Haiti.
