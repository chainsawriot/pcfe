Subject: Embassy Sana'a Refutes Press Reports that Saleh Will Stay in Yemen

Colleagues,

For your situational awareness, Embassy Sana'a just met with one of outgoing President Saleh's advisors. Post reports
they have no evidence to support the assertion that Saleh will stay in Yemen, and Post believes he still intends to depart
in the near future.

According to Post, some of Saleh's General People's Congress party members met today, and some of the party's
hardliners have initiated a campaign to encourage Saleh to stay. However, Post has no evidence that the statement
referenced in the below press piece actually reflects Saleh's own intent.

Best regards,
Stephanie

Subject: Yemeni president now plans to stay in country (AP)

SANAA, Yemen - (AP) A top official in Yemen's ruling party says the outgoing president has decided to
remain in the country because protests against his regime have spread to include members of the civil service
and key military units.

   President Ali Abdullah Saleh had said he would travel to the United States to calm tensions in his country
after 10 months of protests seeking his ouster. Saleh signed a deal last month to transfer power in exchange for
immunity from prosecution over the deadly crackdown on protesters.
   Mohammed al-Shayekh, a leading member of Saleh's People's Congress Party, said Saturday that Saleh
would stay because of the threats posed by new protests staged by employees of government agencies and
members of the security forces.
