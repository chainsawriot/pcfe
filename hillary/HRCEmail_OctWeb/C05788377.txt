Subject: Arab League ministers to discuss Syria Jan. 22 (Reuters)

Jan 15 (Reuters) - Arab League foreign ministers will meet on Jan. 22 to discuss the findings of monitors sent to
Syria to observe whether President Bashar al-Assad has implemented a plan to end 10 months of bloodshed,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency said.

   The Arab League monitors are due to complete on Jan. 19 a report on the situation in Syria. An Arab League
committee on Syria, led by Qatar, will discuss the report on Jan. 21 but only a full meeting of the 22-member
body's foreign ministers can decide whether to end, extend or beef up the mission.
