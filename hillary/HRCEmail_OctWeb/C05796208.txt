  Dear Cheryl and Kris:

  Though perhaps late, I forward these personal thoughts to you both with the best of intentions should you wish
  to pass them on to the Secretary. I tried connecting several weeks back, but I failed to do so successfully.

   Dear Madam Secretary:

   I pray this e-mail finds you and your family in good health and spirits. I again thank you for your continued
   extraordinary service to our country. In view of your upcoming speech at Annapolis tomorrow night, I thought I
   would send you a few last minute thoughts with the hope they may reach you and inspire you in some small
   manner. I assume your speech will have some major focus related directly to foreign policy as it should, but as a
   former midshipman (Class of 83) who listened to many of those speeches many years ago, I recommend you
   also connect with those young men and women in a very personal manner in ways that matter to them.

   I cannot think of anyone more capable than you, for example, to relate a story or two about one of my Naval
   Academy heroes and my personal mentor while I served in the Navy, ADM Mike Mullen, who exemplifies the

 naval officer we all aspired to be in our own careers. I am sure you could say much on that subject alone. As for
 me, I believe I could best serve you by suggesting you leave them with one very important message —They will
 leave Annapolis with the skills and the power to make a positive difference in the, lives of others in ways they
 cannot even begin to imagine. They should make the most of that experience to serve our nation and world
 the best they can. Use Mike Mullen and your own example to show how two young and perhaps very different
 individuals changed the lives of millions for the betterment of mankind.

 As for myself, I was one of the first in my generation of Cuban refugees to attend the Naval Academy in 1979.
 We were poor in Cuba and immigrated poor to New York City in 1962, settling in a rat-infested tenement
 building in Hell's Kitchen. We were fortunate to get out of the country while my father, Raul, was awaiting trial
 for counter-revolutionary activities. I never expected to be accepted to Annapolis, but was inspired by my
 father and my mother Martha, who both worked two jobs most of their lives, and encouraged me to apply,
 despite the odds against me. Annapolis changed my life in ways I could never have then imagined. First and
 foremost, it gave me the skills I needed to become a good naval and military officer. It taught me to lead men
 and women during times of peace and war. I studied electrical engineering and later became a Space Systems
 Engineer, managing a satellite ground station that played a role in NASA's Clementine satellite, mapping the face
 of the moon. Annapolis gave me the fortitude to stand beside my fellow Americans at Ground Zero on 9/11 and
 later commission the USS BULKELEY in NYC against great odds, later that same year at the Intrepid Museum in
 honor of those that gave their lives so bravely. Annapolis impassioned me to be a life-long student of politics
 and diplomacy, helping me to become White House Fellow to Jack Lew. After retirement from naval service,
 Annapolis gave me the confidence to enter the private sector and launch my own engineering company that
 today employs fifty Americans. The Academy gave me the moral stability to run for the Virginia House of
 Delegates at a time (2007) of much hatred towards Hispanics in the State of Virginia despite knowing it would be
 an uphill political battle. Annapolis also taught me to take charge in leading Virginia Hispanics for Hillary and to
 introduce you at your first rally in Manassas, during your own campaign for President. My life would not be what
 it is today if it were not for the United States Naval Academy. Annapolis taught me to always strive, in my own
 small way, to make a positive difference in the lives of others because it is the right thing to do. I do feel like I
 have made a small difference, and I graduated near the bottom of my class! Leave those midshipman with a
 message that they too will be afforded the opportunity to change the world in positive ways, and they need to
 embrace that challenge.

 I do look forward to your speech tomorrow and will be there with my youngest son, John and wife Betty, as we
 want our son to better understand what it means to serve one's country as you and Admiral Mullen have done
 so well. While I doubt I will have the opportunity to say hello in person , please know that our prayers and best
 wishes will be with you then and always.

  With deepest respect,


 Carta
