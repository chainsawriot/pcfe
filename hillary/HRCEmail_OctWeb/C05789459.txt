Cheryl,

Governor Quinn would like a short meeting tomorrow with S to discuss the G-8 and NATO Summits in Chicago in May,
his trip to Brazil, and the Summit of the Americas in Columbia. And he would like the Secretary to know that they are
looking to name something after the Secretary's Mother in Illinois.

Thanks,

Reta Jo
