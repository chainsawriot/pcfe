Subject: UPDATE: Annan Security Council Briefing


The Security Council received a briefing via video conference from Joint Special Envoy Annan this morning, in
which he stated that a fragile cessation of violence appears to have taken effect despite isolated incidents of
fighting. He called isolated fighting as " not unusual" in situations like this.

Annan noted and quoted yesterday's SARG letter.

Annan asked the Council to:

- Stress the need for SARG troops and armor to return to barracks,

 -Approve an advance observer team now and be ready to initiate a full observer mission, both of which will
 need complete freedom of movement, unimpeded access throughout the entire Syrian territory, unimpeded
 communications in country and to headquarters, unimpeded access to all Syrians, security guarantees from all
 parties without prejudice to movement.

Annan confirmed actions taken today do not constitute full compliance by the Syrian Government, notably item
#2, as Syrian forces and weapons around population centers remain. Additionally, Annan stated that the Syrian
Government has not yet complied with the other aspects of his six-point plan.

The secretariat confirmed that the SG's report on a full mission could be ready as soon as April 13.
