There is apparently some Bulgarian proverb about a woman's hair tells her mood, and one of the
newspapers repeated it the morning of thd visit - Bulgarian protocol brought it to the PM's
attention. I think the PM was trying to lighten the mood, as awkward as it may have been. Please
reassure S that there was nothing personal intended. Add it to the lore and many stories you must
collect as the Secretary travels. Thanks once again for the visit. Fyi, we are getting great traction
today on the Roma event.
