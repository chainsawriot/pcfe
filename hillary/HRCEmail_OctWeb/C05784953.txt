Subject: Burma seeks final peace pacts with ethnic rebels (AP)



YANGON (AP) - A top Burmese official assigned to negotiate an end to fighting with ethnic minority rebel
groups says the government is determined to achieve a permanent peace with them in three to four years.
  Aung Thaung, who heads the government's Peace Committee, said December 16 that peace talks are being
held with the Shan, Mon, Karen, Kayah and Kachin groups based on mutual respect and without any
preconditions.
  He told reporters that President Thein Sein ordered an end to fighting with Kachin rebels in the north last
week but skirmishes continued because communicating with troops in remote areas was difficult.
