Subject: Top Israeli rabbi: Segregated buses not Jewish law (AP)

JERUSALEM - (AP) Israel's chief rabbi has ventured into the divisive question of gender segregation, saying
such practices, adopted by some devout Jews, are not required by Jewish law.
   Rabbi Shlomo Amar spoke on Monday after U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was quoted by
Israeli media as expressing shock over segregated buses and other practices adopted by ultra-Orthodox religious
activists.
   In a radio interview, Amar criticized these relatively new and controversial practices. He says people do these
things for their own sake, but "it's not Jewish law."
   In recent months, radical activists have also cowed advertisers into removing images of women from
billboards, shunted women onto separate sidewalks and walked out of military events were women were
singing.
