I know there is much uproar about the Quran burnings. But in Saudi, the only proper conservative way to safely dispose
of Gods name or book is to burn it. You can't bury it or put it in water because you can't risk someone "stepping" on it.
We use to tear off sheets of paper with holy words written on them and burn them in our kitchen. The crime here is that
non-Muslims were doing it....
