Clinton Tells Her "Senior Staff" That Gration Is "Not Our Problem." In his "In the Loop" column for the Washington Post
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/06/AR2009100603680.html> (10/7, A23, 684K), Al
Kamen reports, "The State Department, not to mention some in the human rights community, have been much upset of
late with special envoy J. Scott Gration's softer line in dealing with the ruling thugocracy, including the easing of
sanctions," in Sudan. According to Kamen, during a recent "morning senior staff meeting," Secretary Clinton was asked
"what State was going to do about Gration's comments." Clinton, Kamen says, replied, "That's not our problem. That's
their problem," while "pointing toward the White House."
