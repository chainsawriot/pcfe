Cheryl

Please thank the Secretary for the thoughtful and memorable call that helped Embassy Valletta carry out its evacuation
duties in highest spirits.

I know you were instrumental in fitting the call into the Secretary's incredibly busy schedule.

My sincere gratitude on behalf of Embassy Valletta for your thoughtful support and guidance. Every hand and hug of
friendship that I received from our fellow Americans and fellow citizens of the world should by rights be shared with
you. The safe and secure return of these good people is a completed project you can take great pride in.

And two special events especially brightened the arduous journey: Secretary Clinton's thoughtful call and when the
waves grew high and the spirit low, an escorting Navy plane appeared in the sky.

Thank you,
Ambassador Kmiec
