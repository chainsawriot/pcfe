Talking Points for SEC Clinton

Chuck, I'm forwarding the list of our four most important meetings and talking points for Sec. Clinton. I know this is a
really difficult weekend for her, given events at the UN, so will understand if she is not able to help.



Talking Points

For Call with SEC Clinton

Re: Shaheen India Trade Mission




•  Over the last year, SEN Shaheen has been planning to travel on a trade mission with a delegation of New
Hampshire businesses to India.

      They currently have 5 New Hampshire businesses and 2 universities en route to India for the trade mission.
•    Unfortunately, due to the House's complete unwillingness to compromise on funding the government and
providing disaster relief funds, we are forced to cancel recess and SEN Shaheen is no longer able to travel to India.
•    A number of high-level meetings with the Secretaries of various Ministries were scheduled with the Senator and
these New Hampshire businesses.
•    Our concern is that these meetings will no longer happen as a result of the SEN not being able to attend.
•    ASK: We are hoping you can assist us in briefly reaching out to the Indian government and asking for them to keep
those scheduled meetings to the best of their ability.
•     We will also be reaching out to AMB Burleigh (bur-lee) in New Delhi. He has committed to an evening networking
reception at his residence. We are hopeful he will do what he can to keep this commitment and to ensure adequate
attendance. •      This was an important trade mission, and these businesses have already paid their way to India. Any
assistance you can provide in ensuring that they get these high-level meetings would be appreciated.
