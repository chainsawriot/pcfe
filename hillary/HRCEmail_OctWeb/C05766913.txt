Jake — Per our conversations yesterday, I reached out to Frank Ricciardone about a potential S call to HK about
announcements on key issues before London. This was his response, which we wanted to share with you immediately,
despite it being Christmas, as                                         , which Richard asked that you get word to S         B5
about immediately, even on Xmas:

                                                                                                                       1.4(B)
                                                                                                                       1.4(D)
                                                                                                                       B1




                                                                                                                            B5




We're also alerting          Petraeus/Gates/Mullen to the UNAMA news, and as soon as we hear more from Post on
this, we'll keep you apprised.

All that said, RH may see even greater urgency for an S call to K, due to this news:

                                                                                                        1.4(B)

Frank—

          In Richard's and Paul's absence this week, I'm minding the store, and Richard asked me to seek your advice on
the following issue. Not wanting to bother you on Christmas, and since nothing will be done on this until over the
weekend at the earliest, I wanted to raise it with you by email. If you'd like to discuss this by phone instead, I'd be
happy to talk at any point in the next few days, and can be reached through State Ops at any time.




         Thanks for any thoughts you may have on this topic.

         Best,
         Dan
