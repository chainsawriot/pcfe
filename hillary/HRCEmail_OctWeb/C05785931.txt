Problem is by the time they have the mtg it will be too late in Paris unless they do early. Also, we need support on these
other points.

Talked to Jim.

First, he is quite worried about the nuclear plant. He just talked to Poneman who said                                       1.4(D)
                                                                                                                Good news    B1
from human life perspective is that the radiation is blowing out to sea. He said we're doing all we can, so it's not a
matter of USG action.

Second, he said the meeting on Libya will be Monday not today and that he will work to make sure the document
contains flexibility on the Emiratis and Qataris.
