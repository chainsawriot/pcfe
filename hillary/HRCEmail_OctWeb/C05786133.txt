HI Jake,

Since I've been telling everybody else, I thought I should also convey it to you directly... I thought your presentation was
really quite compelling at the Foreign Policy lunch yesterday. It actually sounded like a plausible strategy! The
Secretary's Policy Planner at work. Thanks very much for attending and making such an important presentation.

Martin
