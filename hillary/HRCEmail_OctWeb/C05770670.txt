I asked the same q about economy - you covered it in your opening last year.

On the message, I agree it's not exciting, but it basically is the win-win point, combined with the idea that our
cooperation is needed to solve global problems and advance mutual interests.

We discuss development ... I will ensure we work in other topics (health, ed, women, etc.) and also find other ways to
sharpen.

It seems "off" to me. Is the messsage, we're working toward a "win-win" strategy? Also, will Geithner be upset because I
talk about the economy? And I don't think I can limit my references only to climate change and energy w all these other
USG officials present and w deliverables we're seeking/announcing. I have to mention health, education, development
and women at least. Can we fix in written text before morning?
