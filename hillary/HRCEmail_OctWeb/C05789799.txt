Latest from Roberta:

We hoped for a deal with a footnote as Holguin had offered earlier to S, but Colombians can't seem to pull off the Cuba
part, and have just told us that they will put the Cuba para up for decision, understanding we will say we, cannot accept,
and they will end the session without consensus on declaration, and thus go with Prez statement. Too bad, but
Colombians know we-and they tried.
