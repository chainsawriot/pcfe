RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has banned all protests and marches, state television on Saturday cited the
Interior Ministry as saying after Saudi minority Shi'ites staged small protests in the oil-producing eastern
province.

   Security forces would use all measures to prevent any attempt to disrupt public order, state news channel al-
Elchbariya said in an alert without giving details.

News Tickers alert senior Department officials to breaking news. This item appears as it did in its original publication and does not contain analysis or commentary
