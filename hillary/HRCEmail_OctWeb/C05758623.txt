We'll get the mandate unless CB0 screws it up; but that seems to be moving along, so hopefully, it won't be a problem.
As the story below said, the mandate was in the Senate Finance walkthrough document. Not even as an option, just
proposed, so Grassley signed off on it.

Lots of things could fall in the direction of your campaign proposal - a mandate with a smallish version of the exclusion
along with a premium cap. That's by no means assured, but if it does break that way, I will try to ensure I'm not the only
one who notices (between us, of course).

Things seem to be going pretty ok with health care. Bills will be emerging soon. Financing is a concern. And the public
plan is in trouble. Wyden introduced the idea of a trigger in committee about ten days ago in the private Finance
walkthrough, and since then, it's the idea all these Senators are glomming onto; it may be difficult to get more than that
out of the Senate.                                                         The House seems to be standing a bit firm for
now though, but even there, the public plan has some issues.

The best people to talk to are Rahm - he's doing message, strategy and overseeing the Hill - and Nancy-Ann, who is
running point at the White House. She's a big fan of yours (and did a lot in the primary as a surrogate for us). I like her a
lot. Peter doesn't really have the ball (right now). Nancy-Ann very much works for Rahm



I hope you've gotten some rest too this weekend, but with all the world's travails, I know that might not be likely. I'll
keep in touch.

Let's hope we get the mandate since we know nothing will work wtout it. So how's it going? If I were to talk to one or
two decision makers about a few matters, who would that be--Orszag? Rahm or Zeke? Nancy Ann? Or???

Hope you're enjoying some time off today. Pls stay in touch.

This was on Paul Krugman's blog yesterday. I, for one, enjoyed it. Hope you're very well Hillary.

  Health care could soon go the way of the automobile, with users having no choice but to buy insurance coverage.

  Within four years, every American could be required to own health insurance or pay their way through tax penalties.
The odds of such a sea change rose last week when chief Democratic and Republican Senate negotiators on a health
care bill acknowledged that many on the Finance Committee considered the so-called individual mandate essential to
lower insurance costs for those who already have coverage.




  President Barack Obama didn't embrace the individual mandate during the campaign, which means he would
essentially start from scratch in terms of selling the idea to voters.

  The mandate was a central policy difference with Hillary Clinton, who argued that a mandate was the only way to
achieve universal coverage. Obama disagreed, saying enough people would purchase insurance voluntarily if the costs
could be brought down.

  Progressive policy experts widely agreed that Obama's plan would have left out about 15 million people. Clinton, with
an assist from New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, regularly assailed Obama for his no-mandate position.

Actually, I don't care who gets credit, as long as we actually get universal health care.
