I raised it w Dai and believe they will respond positively even tho he did not provide a specific name of person or agency
for followup. We can ask the Ambassador who was there to do so when we see him at the Hu meeting later today.

Subject: China and the Cookstove Alliance

Madame Secretary

We may have made a breakthrough with China on cookstoves. Following my visit to Beijing last month, your letter to
Dai last week (inviting China to join the Alliance), and Melanne's discussion with Councilor Liu yesterday, China's MFA
today requested information from Embassy Beijing on the process for joining the Alliance.
