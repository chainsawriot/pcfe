Subject: Sudanese head of Arab mission to Syria resigns (AP)

CAIRO (AP) - An Arab League official says the Sudanese head of the League's observer mission to Syria has
resigned.
   The official said Gen. Mohammed Ahmed Al-Dabi stepped down on Sunday.
   Al-Dabi's resignation comes on the same day that foreign ministers from the 22-member group are to
consider a proposal to send a new mission to Syria with Arab League and U.N. observers.
   The official said League chief Nabil Elaraby will nominate former Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul-Illah al-
Khatib as the new envoy to Syria. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the
subject.
   The League suspended its observer mission last month amid a surge in violence as President Bashar Assad's
regime battles an uprising that began 11 months ago.
