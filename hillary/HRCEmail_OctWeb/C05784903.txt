Subject: China says its envoy met Myanmar opposition leader (AP)

BEIJING (AP) - China says that its ambassador to Myanmar has met Aung San Suu Kyi in the first reported
meeting between one of the military regime's biggest backers and the high-profile opposition leader.
  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Weimin said Thursday that the meeting came at Suu Kyi's request.
He would not say when it took place.
  The meeting comes amid democratic stirrings in Myanmar that have raised hopes of change after decades of
military rule.
  Suu Kyi met earlier this month with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, whose visit raised questions
about Myanmar's ties with China.
