Subject: Message from Dan Fried for S and Cheryl on MEK

Following up on yesterday's update, Dan Fried reports that, according to UN Special Representative Martin Kobler, an
MOU signing on Ashraf is possible on Christmas day. Maliki today re-accepted the MOU and made constructive
suggestions for edits, which Kobler put into the MOU.

If the MOIL is siened the bieeest auestion will be the reaction from MEK/Paris Kobler is prepared to go there after
Christmas.                                                                                                          B1
                  The UNSC statement and S statements will obviously be delayed, but Fried will work media tomorril .4(D)
if the signing occurs; if it does, he also will prepare another note to S.

Best,
Nima
