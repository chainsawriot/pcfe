Subject: Rights group warns of cover-up in Egypt killings (AP)

CAIRO - (AP) A leading international rights group has warned of a cover-up by the Egyptian military in the
investigation of the killing of more than two dozen mostly Coptic Christian demonstrators in the deadliest single
incident since the February overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak.
  The New-York based Human Rights Watch called Tuesday for the independent investigation of the October
9 deaths of 27 people, mostly Christian, in front of Cairo's TV building. Military vehicles were filmed running
down protesters.
   The group also urged authorities to transfer investigation of the case from military to civilian prosecutors.
   Meanwhile, prominent youth protest leader Alaa Abdel-Fatah posted on Twitter on Tuesday that he had been
summoned before Egypt's military prosecutor in connection to the same incident.
