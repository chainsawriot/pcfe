Subject: Friends of Yemen: who represents Yemen?

To all:

I mentioned this to D(L) today in the Thursday staff meeting, and I'd be grateful to have guidance from the
Secretary. The issue is whether Yemeni President All Abdullah Saleh should be invited to the Friends of Yemen
meeting in London. (If it's not Saleh, Yemen's rep would probably be Yemeni Foreign Minister Abubakr Qirby,
who will be in Washington next week.)




Thanks for any guidance.

Jeffrey Feltman
