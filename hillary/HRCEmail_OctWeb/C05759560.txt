Colleagues,

Ops received the attached short-fuse Washfax (UNCLASS) from the White House Situation Room a short time ago.




Per instructions from the ExecSec and S staff, Ops is forwarding you a copy of this Washfax and is standing by to assist in
any way necessary.

Gregory Macris
Senior Watch Officer
