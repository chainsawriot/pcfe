Hello Cheryl:

I am excited about the prospect of S doing a HIV-related speech as part of the lead-up to the IAS 2012
conference. On our end, we're tentatively weighing a speech in November as a good time to set a tone pre-
World AIDS Day and help to shape some of the narrative around the issue.

I know that you had some concerns about the timing of the speech and the possibility of someone scooping S on
this issue. I do not think that is an issue, for the following reasons:
1.Advocates would be excited to hear S talk about HIV/AIDS, and any speech she gives will be viewed as
evidence that both the State Department and the Administration care about this issue.
2. PEPFAR has traditionally been and remains the leading implementer of HIV/AIDS related programs in the
world. While others may talk about the science, the science means nothing without the ability to translate it into
program. The actions of PEPFAR and the U.S. government will provide the engine for these efforts, and this
speech will be a chance for S to take credit for our accomplishments and also highlight our role as the world's
leader on global AIDS activities. No one can refute PEPFAR's results, and no one has a record to match the one
that we have built under the tenure of the Secretary. The only thing that could preempt the S giving this speech
would be if POTUS wanted to do it.

My office is working to map out more details around timing and speech-related activities and rollout. Please let
me know if you'd like to discuss more.
