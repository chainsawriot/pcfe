Cheryl,
Please tell HRC how pleased her fans are that she made Kareem Abdul-Jabar a cultural ambassador. I am
teaching a course on Sports, Diplomacy and Globalization at Oxy this term, and we might invite Kareen to
campus to tell us how his first diplomatic mission to Brazil has gone. We will be producing some case studies
on sports and diplomacy, and I will, of course, be happy to share them with your folks at State.
Regards,
Derek
