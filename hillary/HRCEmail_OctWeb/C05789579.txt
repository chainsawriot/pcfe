Hi Nora-

My name is Dan Brundage and I am David Plouffe's assistant. Plouffe told me that he spoke with Secretary Clinton
earlier and they decided they should meet. I can certainly work off of your availability, and Plouffe can come to the
State Department for the meeting. Apologies for the lack of background info, and thanks for your help.




Thank you
Dan
