As for 5 p.m., I'll be on my cell,             If there's any problem reaching me that way, my office is staffed until 6,
and that's 797-6200. I.have to leave my house at 6:15 for a Russia brainstorming session with John Beyrle, Bob Gallucci
and Vartan Gregorian. I'm sure that confab will produce conceptual and diplomatic breakthroughs galore, transforming
your relationship with Sergei. Looking forward to connecting. Cheers, Strobe

Clarification on my part. I realize that you talked to Brian and Paul re Cuba, and of course I'd only discuss that subject
with you directly and privately. That's what "OK" meant in my previous message. That conversation I can have with you
Friday after 5 or Saturday morning, which ever you'd prefer.
  I then went on to having just returned from Beijing where Martin, Ken Lieberthal, Denny Blair, and another colleague
and I met with 5-person delegations from India and China. It's that Track II trialogue that I've consulted with Jake &
Team about and was going to report back through them.
 Let me know if you want to do either of these two matters differently.
 Strobe

Strobe--Since I talked to them and told them I'd follow up w you, I'd prefer talking to you myself if you can let me know
when it would be convenient. I could also make early Sat morning before 10am work. Thx.

Dear Strobe,

Brian Greenspun and Paul Cejas briefed me on your trip and their discussions about Alan Gross which I'd like to discuss
w you.

I could talk tomorrow night after 6 or Friday after noon if there's a time then that works for you.

All the best, H
