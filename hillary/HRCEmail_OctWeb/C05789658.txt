Madame Secretary,

Thank you for leading us all through the G-8, a sometimes painful process. At about 12:50 we brought the statement to
a close, including Syria language (which Jake saw and carried to you before your press avail) and came to an agreement
on a DPRK statement to be released by the U.S. as a G-8 Foreign Ministers statement if the missile is launched any time
this week. On a couple of the issues we discussed this morning, the outcomes were interesting. Although FM Baird
ultimately offered an addition to try to 'create balance' other countries had such trouble with his language (US was
reluctantly ok), that in the end language about settlements and about rockets from Gaza was dropped entirely. On
human rights, Russia agreed to drop its offensive additions, and offered a legalistic asterisk to the effect that these
designations do not exist in international law and thus Russia cannot support) if we wanted to leave LGBT in the
statement. The consensus was that LGBT was important enough to accept the Russian *. We also got agreement to add
a couple of paragraphs on climate. So sometime this afternoon, through our press office, we will release the 2012 G8
Foreign Ministers Chair's Statement including the annex.

I now leave in a short bit to Istanbul and our effort to deal with Iran's nuclear program. I will stay in touch through Bill
and wish you a terrific trip to Cartegena and beyond. Hope the flowers and trees elsewhere bring some relief. It is a
privilege to work for and with you.

Best,
Wendy
