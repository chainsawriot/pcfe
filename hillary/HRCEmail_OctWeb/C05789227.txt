Dear Cheryl:
I hope you are well — thank you for fixing Bulgaria. I'm writing because I finally read the agenda for the Newsweek/Daily
Beast event in NYC — and I am writing to say I am very proud of you! I'm sorry that I won't be there — I waited too long
to RSVP. I'm so pleased you are getting recognized for the work you are doing — you have made a huge
difference. Along the same lines, — I had a meeting with Deputy Assistant Secretary Phil Reiker who was practically
glowing as he described Secretary Clinton's personal engagement in resolving the framework issues between Serbia and
Kosovo last week. I spent an hour with Phil trying to figure out if there is a way to get the name issue resolved between
Macedonia and Greece so Macedonia could get into NATO -- Anyway that's another story -- I want to say how proud I
am of the Secretary literally every meeting I have at State (and I have a lot of them) professionals speak so proudly of
her work, her commitment, her skill, her intelligence and her dedication. All the attributes I know well — but it's good to
hear others recognize them. Sorry I will miss you in NYC — All my best, Karen
