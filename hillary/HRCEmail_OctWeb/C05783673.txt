Subject: Brazil grants residency based on same-sex-marriage (AP)


RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) - Gay couples are gaining new rights in Brazil. The government has granted a Spanish
man the right to permanent residency based on his marriage to a Brazilian man.
   The decision published Monday in Brazil's Federal Register follows a decision in October by the country's
Supreme Court recognizing same-sex marriage. That change leads to a series of benefits for gay couples, such
as the right to jointly file taxes and to jointly adopt a child.
