Former European Central Bank Vice President Lucas Papademos will be the new Greek Prime Minister after negotiations
between Greek political leaders are finalized, according to press.


BIOGRAPHY
Renowned economist Lucas Papadimos (PASOK) is one of the most successful and respected Greeks internationally in
recent times. He is a known quantity and respected in European circles given his work as Deputy Governor of the
European Central Bank under Jean-Claude Trichet, and has a "pro-European" reputation.


Born in 1947, he participated in the Fulbright Foreign Student Program in 1966. He graduated from Athens College and
went on to MIT, where he earned his first degree in Physics, a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering, and a Ph.D in
Economics. He later taught at Columbia University, Harvard University, and as a Professor of Economics at the
University of Athens.


Upon return to Greece in 1985, he worked as a chief economist at the Bank of Greece, becoming Deputy Governor in
1993, and Governor in 1994. As Governor, he oversaw the transition from the drachma to the euro.


In 2002, he moved to Frankfurt to assume the role of the Deputy Governor of the European Central Bank. He worked
very closely with then-Governor Trichet, whom media sources list among his personal friends.



His term ended in 2010 and he returned to Athens amidst rumors that he would join the cabinet of PM
Papandreou. However, he acted only as an unofficial, unpaid advisor to the PM, and reportedly rejected the offer of the
Finance Ministry in Papandreou's June 2011 cabinet reshuffle.


Papadimos is not without controversy. As Governor of the Bank of Greece during the transition to the euro, he has been
held personally responsible by some commentators as the one who "cooked the books" to get Greece into the euro,
following revelations of inaccurate Greek data. His most difficult time was when New Democracy was in power from
2004 to 2009, when he was questioned relentlessly by journalists about his time as Bank of Greece Governor, prompting
even then-candidate for the French Presidency Sarkozy in 2007 to question his appointment to ECB.



Papadimos had written in the recent past against any large-scale restructuring of Greek debt , warning against "great
dangers" and "unforeseen consequences." It is a touch ironic therefore, that he is now called upon to manage a
decision he feared would prove not viable and prevent the dangers he had warned about.


He is married to wife Sana, a Dutch national, who is a painter.
