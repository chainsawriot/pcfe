Hillary-

It was great to see you for a bit at Thanksgiving and hope we can find some time soon to catch up.

I am writing to ask if you'd be interested in speaking at the Truman National Security Project's annual conference from
May 4th to the 6th?
It is an incredible organization and network of our nation's young foreign and domestic policy leaders (I am a little biased
as a Truman fellow). This group is filled with smart, pragmatic, and idealistic young leaders from across the nation and I
consider myself incredibly
fortunate to be a part of it. I think you will really enjoy getting
to spend a little time with some of them.

I've attached a letter with more info from Rachel Kleinfeld, the CEO and founder, who I think you've met a few times
before.

Hope your trip is going well and know that you make all of us so proud.

Love and best, Zach
