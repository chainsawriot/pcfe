Legal Issues

    •   Harold reported on two matters: Article 75 of the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions (on
        humane treatment), where DoD would like to make a positive senior level comment and Additional Protocol II
        which was submitted by the Reagan Administration for ratification and consent in 1987, but has sat in the
        Senate since. DoD thinks it is time to make this a higher priority. Jim cautioned that we need to coordinate
        closely with the W/H on this, especially with the legislative affairs folks who may think the timing is not ideal.
