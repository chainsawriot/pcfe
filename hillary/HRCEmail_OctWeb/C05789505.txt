Jake: President Johnson-Surleaf probably wants the UNOCI to act more aggressively in line with the just passed UNSC
resolution to: (a) protect civilians, (b) take away any heavy military equipment in the hands of Gbagbo's troops, and
(c) break up and disband roadblocks set up by Gbagbo's youth militia. UNOCI has been timid in the past, and the new
UNSC resolution should give it some incentive and backbone to act more aggressively. In a conversation with my French
counterparts today, they suggested that the French, British and US Perm Reps in New York should demarche UNSG Ban
ki Moon to ask him to instruct UNOCI to energetically enforce the new resolution as soon as it is approved. We have
passed that message to New York. Johnnie

Johnnie â€” what does "more teeth" mean? Is this an ROE issue, or an authorization issue? My understanding is that
UNOCI has a chapter vii mandate to protect civilians...

The Secretary may receive a call this evening from Liberian President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, who has been in touch with
Ivoirian President Ouattara. If the call comes through, I recommend the Secretary take it.

The situation in the Ivory Coast is fluid and may be at a tipping point. Ouattara's forces are actively claiming territory in
the west along the Liberian border and reportedly captured a major town (and Gbagbo stronghold) north of the capital
Abidjan just a few hours ago. With the military situation turning sharply in favor Ouattara, Gbagbo and his thugs may
become unpredictable and dangerous.

Ouattara told President Johnson-Sirleaf that the situation in Abidjan this weekend may be very bloody, with unintended
consequences for Liberia. President Johnson-Sirleaf wants to push for "more teeth" for UNOCI, although neither she nor
Ouattara believes they are protecting civilians.
