Lissa--I'd rather send a glowing letter w a personal handwritten note
further since I'm never sure about being able to schedule personal phone calls. We can fax the letter to her personal fax
and send hard copy.

I'm copying Rob Russo so you can work w him to draft and he can start finding the best way to get it to her.

Does this work for you?
