I've heard contradictory reports as to whether or not there are planes flying and firing on crowds. What is the evidence
that they are?

Several have proposed it but honestly, we actually don't know what is happening from the air right now. As we gain more
facts, we can consider.

Re: No fly zone over Libya


UK former Foreign Secretary David Owen has called for a no-fly zone over Libya, imposed by the United
Nations and/or Nato, like the no-fly zone imposed on Saddam' s Iraq. US might consider advancing tomorrow.

article below:


UN should authorise NATO and Egypt to enforce
Libyan 'No Fly Zone' to protect civilians
n the wake of reported air attacks on civilian crowds by the Libyan airforce, former Foreign Secretary Lord
)avid Owen has called on the UN Security Council to immediately meet in emergency session and authorise a
No Fly Zone' over Libya.
;peaking on al Jazeera, Lord Owen called for a UN Charter Chapter 7 intervention (meaning the authorisation
&both military and non-military means to "restore international peace and security") to be enforced by NATO
ir forces with Egyptian military support to demonstrate regional backing for the effort.
,ord Owen said: "The UN Security Council should meet in emergency session tonight and declare the situation
n Libya as a threat to peace under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter and declare a no flight zone for the Libyan air
orce and ask the regional power, Nato, to enforce it from dawn tomorrow. And hopefully other Arab nations,
â–ºarticularly Egypt, might decide to participate to demonstrate that this is not just a Western initiative."
,ord Owen went on to call for "air forces in the region with sufficient range to reach Libya to prevent any
,ibyan air force military action against civilians". The call matches those of human rights advocates for actions
lot just words from the international community. The New York Times' Nick Kristof tweeted : "Under "Right
o Protect" doctrine, West cld bomb air fields from which Qaddafi's warplanes are taking off." And: "Better
'et: Egypt & Tunisia could use their air forces to ground Qadaffi's planes, keep him from slaughtering his
)eople."
