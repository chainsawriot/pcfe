Here is a draft:
When I first met Capricia in 1992, I knew right away she would be a woman to watch. I have seen her grow over the last
20 years as a thoughtful advisor, selfless leader, my unofficial stylist and a dear friend. She constantly delivers under
pressure â€” always with dignity, respect for others, uncommon humor, grace and humility.

Capricia:.from the White House, to the campaign, to your legacy as Chief of Protocol, you have been a true trailblazer.
