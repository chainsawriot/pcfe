Anne-Marie Slaughter tweets call for intervention in Libya

from The Cable by Josh Rogin

Former State Department Policy Planning Chief Anne-Marie Slaughter used her brand new Twitter account on Thursday
to call for international intervention on behalf of the Libyan people.
"The international community cannot stand by and watch the massacre of Libyan protesters. In Rwanda we watched. In
Kosovo we acted," Slaughter tweeted, in one of her first ever entries. She confirmed to The Cable that the Twitter
account is genuine.
Slaughter seems to be enjoying the freedom to express her opinions openly following her exit from government. Her
message goes far beyond what President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have said about the
Libyan crisis.
Both Clinton and Obama have said that all options are on the table, but no specific decisions have been made on how
the international community might respond to the unfolding crisis in Libya. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley
said on Wednesday that sanctions and asset freezes are being discussed, but he didn't mention military intervention.
By invoking Rwandan, Slaughter is comparing the situation in Libya to the 1994 bloodshed that saw 800,000 Rwandans
murdered in about 100 days -- a clear case of genocide. Likewise in 1999, NATO bombed the Serbian capital of Belgrade
following that government's genocidal actions in Kosovo, although a U.N. court in 2001 decided the situation did not
technically constitute genocide.
Libya's deputy ambassador to the United Nations Ibrahim Dabbashi, who resigned this week in protest of the Libyan
government's brutal crackdown, contended that Col. Muammar al-Qaddafi's massacre of civilians constitutes genocide,
but no U.S. officials have made such a statement.
Slaughter's other messages on her first week on Twitter focused on how to use social networks to aid in the Arab
uprising spreading throughout the region.
"I am a thinker and writer on foreign affairs who believes that foreign policy must be very different in the networked
world," she wrote in her Twitter bio.
