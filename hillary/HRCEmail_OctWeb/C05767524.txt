Subject:                          Miliband call



The Miliband letter on Yemen you received tonight contains his proposal for how to structure the Yemen meeting In
London.

Apologies for the unsolicited and perhaps utterly obvious recommendation, but here goes:
                                                       I'd recommend that you tell him that you'd like to give the
meeting (participation, agenda, etc.) some thought and to engage in some discussions here.

You could discuss with                     later in the morning and then have Phil or others get back to their
counterparts after you've decided how you think this is best handled.
