Subject                            RE: Senate Health Care Bill Passes - 60-39



It turns out Reid accidentally voted against the bill before catching himself.

"No â€” ah, yes!" he said, causing the outburst of laughter among his colleagues.

Subject: Senate Health Care Bill Passes - 60-39

As expected, the Senate health care bill passed this morning by a vote of 60-39. Senators voted from their desks, and
Vice President Biden presided in the chair.

Senator Bunning did not vote.
