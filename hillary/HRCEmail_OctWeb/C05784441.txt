Subject: Clinton deliverables tomorrow

Jake and Alec - Tomorrow OECD Council will adopt (if all goes per plan)
     ■ the Internet Policy Principles --- a major deliverable on the Internet Freedom agenda and
     ■ Open OECD (free and open access to their treasure trove of data) - which Secretary Clinton
        and FM Hague wrote SG Gurria demanding.
I just heard that S is in London today. Probably too late to work it in but I wanted to let you know so
we can figure out some way to chalk this up to her openness agenda. Let me know what I can do.
Many thanks, Karen
