Jake, Huma

S called me this morning and, inter alia, asked me to raise with Massoud Barzani the treatment of a
                          detained since July. Please let S know that Barzani canceled his meeting
with me, over a petty pique, so I could not. Thus, we're getting the            notes into the BCL
for Tom Nides, who sees Barzani tomorrow.

Thanks,
Jeff
