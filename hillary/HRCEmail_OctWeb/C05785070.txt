Jake/Toria,

The. U.S.-Romania Ballistic Missile Defense Agreement (BMDA) will officially enter-into-force (EIF) next
Wednesday, December 21. A cable will be transmitted on Monday evening to key allies and
partners informing them of this milestone, and the U.S. and Romania will release a brief joint
statement announcing ElF of the BMDA on Wednesday morning.

Ellen Tauscher provided Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Ryabkov a pre-notification of the
announcement at their meeting this past Wednesday in Washington. While Ryabkov noted that
Russia would respond to the announcement with its normal talking points, he said that he
appreciated the advanced notification. Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Frank
