                                       Talking Points                      RELEASE IN FULL


                                For Call with SEC Clinton
                             Re: Shaheen India Trade Mission



         • Over the last year, SEN Shaheen has been planning to travel on a trade
         mission with a delegation of New Hampshire businesses to India.

         • They currently have 5 New Hampshire businesses and 2 universities en
         route to India for the trade mission.

         • Unfortunately, due to the House's complete unwillingness to
         compromise on funding the government and providing disaster relief funds,
         we are forced to cancel recess and SEN Shaheen is no longer able to travel
         to India.

         • A number of high-level meetings with the Secretaries of various
         Ministries were scheduled with the Senator and these New Hampshire
         businesses.

         • Our concern is that these meetings will no longer happen as a result of
         the SEN not being able to attend.

         • ASK: We are hoping you can assist us in briefly reaching out to the
         Indian government and asking for them to keep those scheduled meetings to
         the best of their ability.

         • We will also be reaching out to AMB Burleigh (bur-lee) in New
         Delhi. He has committed to an evening networking reception at his
         residence. We are hopeful he will do what he can to keep this commitment
         and to ensure adequate attendance.

         • This was an important trade mission, and these businesses have already
         paid their way to India. Any assistance you can provide in ensuring that
         they get these high-level meetings would be appreciated.
