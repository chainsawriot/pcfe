I met with the head of the Munich breakfast yesterday. She also mentioned the interest in WPS (as well as eagerness of
many of the high level Europeans on security to cooperate with us on the Natoonal Action Plan). When she gets back to
Germany, she is going to send me the list of the attendees so we can follow up.

When I was in Munich, I met w a group of high level women in international national security positions who had heard
about our women in public service initiative and wanted to extend it to Europe. Jane Harmon was there and offered to
house (and fund) it at the Wilson Center. This program really hit a nerve. Let's meet soon on it.
