Subject: Action Memo re: letters from you to NATO SYG and to Ashton

Oscar will print an action memo and two letters for your approval before Monday morning.

A/S Gordon is hoping to hand deliver the letter from you to NATO SYG on Monday morning and to Ashton on Tuesday.

If you approve the memo and the letters this weekend, we will auto pen and scan the letters for Phil to have for the
Monday meeting.
