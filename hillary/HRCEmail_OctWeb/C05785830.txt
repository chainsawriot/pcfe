Subject: US CentCom briefing to Pakistan on NATO attack cancelled (Reuters)

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A briefing by the head of the U.S. Central Command to Pakistani officials on a Nov.
26 cross-border NATO air attack that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers and severely strained ties with Washington
has been cancelled, a Pakistani official said on Friday.

   News that General James N. Mattis' visit to Pakistan has been cancelled came a day after the United States
announced that its investigation into the attack found both American and Pakistani forces were to blame for the
border incident.
