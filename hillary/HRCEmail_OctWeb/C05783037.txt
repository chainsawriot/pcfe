I just met with a couple of women from Libya who are part of a new ngo (they are all new), "Women for Libya". We are
going to get together with a larger group in the next few weeks but I wanted to tell you a couple of points they made
since I know you'll be speaking tom'w. First, Libya is a place where the US and our allies have credibility and suasion, so
what we say matters. Secondly, there is only one woman in the NTC and that kind of symbolism is not sufficient if
Libya's transition to a better future is going to become a reality. It is not only not going to be acceptable to the
international community to marginalize the women but it should not be acceptable to Libyans to exclude half their
population, many of whom were significantly engaged in supporting the uprising. The women are eager to take their
place. They came in today --the way the Northern Irish did with you so many years ago-- and pleaded for support to
build women's leadership capacity and to be embraced as part of a larger network. The cycle repeats itself!
