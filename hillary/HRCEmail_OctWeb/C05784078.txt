Subject: Fw: French Emb needs word from S

Met last night: French Ambassador
and French Board member



Reiterated

1. Need for ED to move to non-managerial position and external role

2. COO reports to Board NOT to ED

3. ED in external Ambassadorial role must not be independent but under direction of Board and COO

4. COO, Executive Management Team (EMT) reports to COO

Note:
* Area of disagreement is number two

* French Ambassador moved after reading critical personnel report As did many board members (implementing country
block as well)

*

Closed Executive session in 3 hours , will have much better assessment

We did not implicate 'S'. Characterized her as supportive of the process running its course.



Thanks for the consult last night

Eric
