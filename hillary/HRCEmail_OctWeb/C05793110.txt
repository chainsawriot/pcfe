Cheryl,

It was good talking to you this morning. As a follow up to our conversation about the Rabbis we spoke about earlier

1. Abraham Chaim Halberstam, d. 9/26/1943

2. Chaim Sziya Halberstam, d. 11/29/1943

Thank you so much for your interest in this matter.
As I explained to you, this is a BIG Mitzvah and I'm sure it will protect you and help you in the great work that you are
doing.
This is about Rabbis Chaim Sziya (Yoshua) Halberstam and Abraham Chaim Halberstam of blessed memory.

Chaim Sziya (Yoshua) Halberstam was born on 12/29/1912.
In March of 1943, the Rabbis were arrested by Russian authorities for being Polish refugees without having Russian
citizenship.
They were eventually imprisoned in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, were they both succumbed to Typhus.
Per an eyewitness, their bodies were removed from the prison grounds for burial.
We assume that they were buried in the Tashkent cemetery approximately 10 miles away from the prison.


What we have been told is that there is a Col. Hanit in the NKVD who has the records and has information where in fact
the Rabbi wre buried and about their death. The phone number to contact Col. Hanit is


 What we need is Not verbal confirmation, but we would like to see an actual document which will confirm where the
 rabbis are buried.

 This is very important for the family and to all the followers of the Bobov sect.

 If you would also like to contact me by phone, the best way to reach me is

 Thank you so much.

 Warmest Regards,
