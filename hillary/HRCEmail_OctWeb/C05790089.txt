Subject: CM is watching

CM's spokesman Derekâ€¢O'Brien tells me the CM is watching this program (though I can't be sure she's watched the
whole thing or with focus). CM is likely to bring up Tagore and Swami Vivekenanda.

Some quick notes from internet:

Its Tagore's 151st birthday on May 8. Vivekenanda's 150th is coming up in 2013.

On September 11 1893, Vivekenanda spoke to a Parliament of world religions in Chicago. He addressed his speech to
his "Sisters and Brothers of America."

He founded the Ramakrishna Mission and is generally credited with introducing Indian spiritual thought to the Western
world.
