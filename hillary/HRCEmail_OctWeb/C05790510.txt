I'm getting lots of favorable emails for the dose of inspiration you provided today.

I forgot to tell you that Judith Rodin offered you a suite of offices after you leave State for your own use at Rockefeller
Fdtn, if you're interested --with no strings attached. She also said the they'd be happy to provide you with a month at
their center in Bellagio if you just want to read and write in a beautiful place.
