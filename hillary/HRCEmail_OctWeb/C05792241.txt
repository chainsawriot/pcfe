      •     Post was checking into a rumor of an Amcit in Timbuktu, but doubted the veracity of the report. MNLA contacts
            were aware of two French citizens, one Dane, and one UK citizen in the north and provided the Europeans'
            contact information to the French embassy.
      •     Bassole is en route to Dakar for consultations on the margins of the Senegalese inauguration, then will return to
            Bamako.
