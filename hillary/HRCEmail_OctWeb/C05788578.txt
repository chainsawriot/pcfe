If she is in town and we can do, we should do a 15 minute drop by if she is amenable.

Merck has also been a leader on family planning and the Secretary could also discuss that/thank him for their significant
commitment on that front as well.

Subject: FW: CEO of Merck Ken Frazier visit to DC March 20-22; request to meet the Secretary

Ken Frazier, the CEO of Merck, has requested a meeting with the Secretary during the window of March 20-22 when he
will be in Washington, DC. Merck is the leading private sector partner for Saving Mothers dedicating over $50m over 5
years and serving as the Secretariat for the partnership. Mr. Frazier has announced at the UN in September that
reducing maternal death by 75% over the next ten years is Merck's major corporate social responsibility goal to which
they have dedicated a total of $500m.

His visit would provide a window for the Saving Mothers event with the Secretary at State, per my prior email, if the
dates with our ambassadors surrounding the CoM conference do not work.

Hi Jeff,

Amb Goosby is keen to get this meeting on the schedule, assuming the Secretary is in Washington, as
you point out. We'll work with Lois' office and we'll try to get you an answer as quickly as possible.

Thanks!

Congratulations. Sounds like an excellent new role. We do a lot of good work with KoMen. I appreciate Jessica's help
and realize there is a threshold question: Is Secretary Clinton even in town during this period. I was about to reach out to
Lois as well, so I am copying her here. I am really glad the MOU is advancing.

Thanks!

Hey, Jeff!

Nice to hear from you...happy to help with this request.. In fact, I've cc'd Ms. Jessica Daly, now Acting Director of my
former office.

I've just moved on from the Department and Jessica will be taking on my role and can coordinate with you/Ken on
behalf of Ambassador Goosby re: outreach to the Secretary. Funny you should send this request, I was just speaking
with Amb Goosby about Merck and Ken yesterday...

Anyway, I have taken a newly created position at Susan G Komen as VP, Global Strategy, Programs and Partnerships.

I hope we can connect in my new capacity! See contact information below:




Over to you and Jess...

British:

Hi. Our CEO, Ken Frazier, will be visiting DC for meetings March 20-22. If possible, I think it would be great for him to
meet with Secretary Clinton to discuss the SMGL partnership if she has any availability during that period. Would be
helpful for them to discuss as we advance. I am happy to contact anyone you think best to raise this with. Any thoughts?

Best,
Jeff
