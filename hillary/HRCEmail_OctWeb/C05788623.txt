I just learned from a memo from EAP and H dates 8/24 that Sen Inouye requested mtg w me in a letter dated 5/12. I
don't understand why I didn't know and why we didn't meet in the last three months. I should do so asap.

Is my mtg w Spanta set for 9/8?

I think I should fly to White Plains Thursday night after the POTUS speech to be ready for Friday events in City. And since
that's for official events the next day, I'd like to leave from Andrews.

Also,                                What time is it on Saturday?
