Subject: US backs Al-Qaeda to mutually destroy Syria' (from Russia Today)

This piece relates to the S comments at this morning's A/S meeting about the role of
semi-official media coming out of other countries.

This is typical Russia Today stuff, in this case designed specifically to shift the narrative
away from their failure at the UNSC on Syria.
