UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has urged nations to accept residents of
a camp of Iranian dissidents in Iraq that Baghdad has vowed to close by the end of the year, according to a
report released December 5.

   "In order to find a durable solution for the camp residents, it is essential that potential third countries indicate
their willingness to receive them for resettlement," Ban said in his latest report to the Security Council on the
U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI).

   Ban said he and other senior U.N. officials "have been encouraging member states in this regard." The U.N.
Security Council will review Ban's report at a meeting December 6.
