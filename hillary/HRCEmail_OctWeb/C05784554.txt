Hi Peter, fascinating to watch MB's response last couple days. I spent yesterday with 4 candidates and youth
activists in Dumyat, Belqas, and Mansoura. I think elections will happen. MB and Salafis are pushing hard. And
nearly every other organized force is more or less in agreement, with some calling for, at most, a 1-2 week
delay. It's not a popular opinion, but i don't think most Egyptians are with the protesters. Tantawi's speech gave
most people most of what they wanted.

What are you guys thinking?

Shadi

 Greeting from Cairo. Hope you're well. Things aren't so well here. Here's my latest in the Atlantic on
 development in Egypt: http ://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/11/dont-postpone-egypts-
