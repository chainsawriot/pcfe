So to briefly review the bidding at 00B EST Sun, as we were in a holding pattern in DC for much of Sat.




                          Does this seem accurate, especially from Post?




What else? Happy to jump on a call if this is easier to discuss by phone, though perhaps email is better given security
concerns.
