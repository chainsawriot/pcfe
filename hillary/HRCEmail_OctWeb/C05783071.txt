RAMALLAH (Reuters) - The Palestinians will not accept anything less than full United Nations membership
and do not want an upgrade to an observer state in the world body, the foreign minister said November 3.

    Riyad al-Malki's remarks suggested the Palestinians would not seek such an upgrade once their bid for full
state membership meets the fate widely expected for it -- failure because of opposition from the United States,
among other governments.

   "We do not want, after all of these struggles, sacrifices, and efforts by the entire Palestinian people, to accept
an observer state in the United Nations. We will not accept less than we deserve: a full member state," he
said.
