Jake:

This speech makes me very happy, not just because of the substance, but because this is precisely how I've always
thought an effective foreign policy speech should be written: Laying out, explicitly, the hardest questions people actually
ask about a particular policy, and then trying to answer them directly, one by one. In other words, naming the elephants
in the room, instead of trying to ignore them, as State Department officials are trained to do! I've always wanted to see
Hillary give a speech just like this. It would be a great template for addressing other issues as well!

Anyway, precisely because it does take on real questions in a direct way, it leaves us plenty to talk about. But that's the
point of a serious speech. So congratulations all around.

Tom

Dear Tom,

Hope you're well. I wanted to share with you an advance copy of Secretary Clinton's speech on democratic
transformation in the Middle East and North Africa, which she will deliver this evening at an event hosted by the
National Democratic Institute. The speech takes on the hard questions that people in the region — and people back here
— have been asking about the U.S. government's policy response to the Arab Spring. We hope this speech helps move
the conversation forward.

We value your feedback, and look forward to discussing this speech with you in the coming weeks.

Best,
