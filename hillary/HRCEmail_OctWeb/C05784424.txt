I understand, but when he raised it he had been told that it did not "apply" to business. When I explained that it applied
to everyone but that businesses were better able to protect themselves, he said the Japanese annd British had better
standards for their businesses. Jim Jeffrey and I promised to look into that. Do you know what he means?

Madame Secretary

The Travel Warning applies to all American citizens

But we work, thru Diplomatic Security's Overseas Security Advisory Committee, to the security officers of companies.

These security professionals understand how to mitigate risks, which the average American traveller would not be able
to do

Pat

PM just asked me if the travel warning applied to companies because if so, they would be hard to recruit tomorrow.
