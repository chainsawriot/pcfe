Yes. I have a long list, too.

Was in sit room all day.

                                                                                                            B5

Familiar with the issue going back weeks/months over efforts to reschedule the summit given the Morocco
commitment. Did not see this proposed announcement before last night's email chain started.

We need to give comments on this by 9am â€” I have not heard from PJ on this, I'm assuming Phil's office is handling for
him as he is out of email range in Russia.

Nancy McEldowney said she had not seen this and promised to look into it and get back to me tomorrow morning. She did
not know whether Phil had seen the draft, but said as far as she knew the EUR front office had not cleared this. I believe
they will recommend an addition.

I spoke to the EUR front office about this. They had not seen the text and thought we would want to highlight as well
what the Secretary will be doing on the 4th.
