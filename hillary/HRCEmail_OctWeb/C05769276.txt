  Background

  Late on December 18, the final full day of the Copenhagen Conference, President Obama met
  with Wen Jiabao, Prime Minister Singh, President Lula and President Zuma.
                                                                                                      1.4(B)
                                                                                                      1.4(D)
                                                                                                      B1




  USG Outreach Efforts

  In the weeks following Copenhagen, USG has launched a broad diplomatic outreach campaign
  to encourage all Parties to the UNFCCC to support the Copenhagen Accord. We have
  demarched over 150 countries, reached out to Ambassadors and regional Assistant Secretaries
  to carry the message at high levels, worked directly with counterparts in key countries to
  coordinate outreach efforts, worked through our mission to the UN, and kept in regular contact
  with the UN and UNFCCC Secretariat on new developments.

  So far nine countries have officially associated with the Accord, with one country (Macedonia)
  inscribing its mitigation action. We have information that the EU (including all 27 member
  countries) will soon associate and inscribe its 20% target (including a conditional 30% target if
  all major economies make comparable commitments). Based on our demarches, we expect
  many more countries will associate and/or inscribe before the January 31 deadline. However,
  many countries are reluctant to decide until their regional or negotiating blocs agree to a
  common position (many of which will meet in mid-February), and many others are waiting to
  see what the U.S. and China do before they publically take a position on the Accord.
