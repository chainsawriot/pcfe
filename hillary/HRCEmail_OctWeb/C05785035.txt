Subject: UAE president pardons 5 convicted activists (AP)


DUBAI, United Arab Emirates - (AP) A lawyer for five political activists who have been convicted of anti-
state crimes in the United Arab Emirates say they have received a presidential pardon and will be released from
custody.
   The lawyer, Mohammed al-Roken, says the public prosecution has confirmed it has received the pardon from
President Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan on Monday.
   There was no immediate word from the president's office.
   The activists, including a prominent blogger and an economics professor were convicted of insulting the
UAE top leadership on Sunday. They were sentenced to up to three years in prison by the Gulf country's
security court.
   The five were arrested in April after they signed an internet petition calling for reforms in the oil-rich
federation.
