Subject: Egypt sets Feb. 26 as start date for NGO trial (AP)

CAIRO - (AP) Egypt's state news agency says the trial of 43 people including 19 Americans in a politically
charged case against foreign-funded groups will begin Feb. 26.
   The investigation has caused the deepest crisis in American-Egyptian relations in decades. American officials
say it could hinder more than $1 billion in U.S. aid. Egyptian authorities have blasted what they call U.S.
interference in legal affairs.
   Nineteen employees of U.S.-based groups are among those to be tried. They work for the International
Republican Institute, the National Democratic Institute, Freedom House and a group training journalists.
   Only seven of the Americans are in Egypt. Some have sought refuge at the American Embassy in Cairo.
   It remains unclear if they will attend the trial.
