Subject: Obama Middle East envoy Ross to step down-White House (Reuters)

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Dennis Ross, a senior aide to President Barack Obama on the Middle East, has
decided to step down from his post, the White House said Thursday.

   "Dennis Ross has an extraordinary record of public service and has been a critical member of the president's
team for nearly three years," White House press secretary Jay Carney said in a statement.

   Ross, a special assistant to the president, had initially pledged to work for Obama for two years, but extended
his time at the White House by another year in light of the Arab Spring upheaval reshaping the Middle East,
Carney said.
