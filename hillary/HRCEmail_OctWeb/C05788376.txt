Subject: Heads Up: Another SWT Problem

Adam Ereli alerted me a few minutes ago about a new SWT problem. The staff of one of Alaska's Senators called ECA this
afternoon to say there is a group of Costa Rican kids working in a fish packing plant in Alaska under very poor
conditions. Apparently some of the kids may have developed frostbite in their feet because the plant is so cold;
presumably they did not have the right wardrobe to keep warm. The sponsor organization for these students was
CETUSA, which had also sponsored the kids working at the chocolate packing plant in Palmyra. (FYI: CETUSA just this
week agreed to withdraw its request for re-designation as a sponsor, when confronted with a 37-page brief from State
about its many violations.)

ECA is gathering more details and promised to share them with us when they know more.
