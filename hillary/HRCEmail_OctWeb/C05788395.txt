Clinton has come here to Muscat twice to meet with the sultan, whom she has lavishly praised on several
occasions.

The respect is clearly mutual. The sultan called Clinton "a lady I admire." He said he had not met President Obama,
but had talked to him by phone several times. "He is a capable man," the sultan said, with somewhat more
measured enthusiasm.
