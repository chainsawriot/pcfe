Cheryl -

My friend Nancy Pelosi spent a busy day with me in Budapest yesterday. Below is th national media service (MTI) news
coverage. S might want to know about it. Nancy also describes the work of S as "spectacular." An accurate description, I
think!

If there is a way for her to thank Nancy for coming here and delivering a tough message, I would really appreciate it.

Thank you! Eleni

Ambassador,

Below is the MTI report and HAC summary as a start.

UPDATE - PELOSI DISCUSSES ACHIEVEMENTS, CONCERNS WITH PM, HOUSE SPEAKER 2012. May 14. 20:13 Budapest,
May 14 (MTI) - Nancy Pelosi, the minority (Democrat) leader of the US House of Representatives, congratulated Prime
Minister Viktor Orban and House Speaker Laszlo Kover on Hungary's achievements and exchanged views with them on
certain US concerns on Monday.

  The concerns were related to the freedom of the press, the independence of the judiciary, and free and fair elections,
Pelosi told reporters in the House of Terror Museum.

 The answers, she said, were promising. The government is in negotiations over recommendations by the Venice
Commission and has expressed awareness of the importance of a free press.

  Pelosi also raised concerns about the independence of the National Bank of Hungary at both meetings.

   She emphasised the strength of bilateral relations and noted that in Afghanistan the two nations' soldiers were
fighting side by side for global security.

  Sharing the view that Hungary continues to be a European and democratic nation, Pelosi added that the country was
solving its problems in its own way. She noted that strong and prosperous democracies have some basic pillars,
including commitment to an independent judiciary, a free press and other values. "We should remind one another how
important these are," she said, noting the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's letter to Orban last year "generated
some positive responses."

  Pelosi, who paid a one-day visit to Budapest to mark the 90th anniversary of Hungarian-US diplomatic relations, noted
that the Hungarian people's fight for freedom in 1956 created a stir throughout the world.

   Maria Schmidt, the director of the museum, said that the "legendary Nancy Pelosi" had always sided with freedom
fighters and championed human rights, which "we would never forget".
