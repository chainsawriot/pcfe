For what it is worth, I know Seif al-Islam â€” once flew w/ him on his jet from Benghazi to London. I have obviously been
very vocal in support of intervention and against Gaddafi himself, so have some credibility w/ both sides. If it would be
useful to use me in any way, am obviously willing. NYT this morning reports, "To many Libyans       who do not support
the armed revolt, Seif al-Islam represents a hope for more gradual change." AM
