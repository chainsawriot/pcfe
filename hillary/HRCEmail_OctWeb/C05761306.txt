FYI â€” if we can get some action                  on this issue that would help a lot. Also, note that Dave Turk is our new
Chief of Staff in H. He worked for the VP on Judiciary Committee and in the House as the Staff Director of the National
Security Subcommittee of Government Oversight (Waxman's Committee). Lot's of great experience handling these
kinds of issues.

I spoke at length last night with Sam Goodstein, Senator Whitehouse's Chief Counsel. He appreciated all the
efforts we have so far made on their behalf and understood the challenges of an expeditious public release of the
Zelikow memo, especially as the issue is not solely within the State Department's jurisdiction. In fact, it would
appear

Senator Whitehouse is seeking public release of the memo, ideally before his subcommittee's hearing next
Wednesday (the 13th) at 10:00 AM entitled, "What Went Wrong: Torture and the Office of Legal Counsel in the
Bush Administration." (Zelikow is one of two witnesses.) Whitehouse's staff understands the challenges in
getting public release by the middle of next week (and they seem resigned that this may not happen), but, at a
minimum, they feel it should be doable for Senator Whitehouse to view the document (even if still in classified
form.) (Note that Whitehouse is a Member of the Senate Intel Committee.)
