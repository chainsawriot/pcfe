         If you look at the Post story, it has a key phrase in there about Gration having to back off his view of Darfur,
which gives me a decent idea where the leak came from. This complicates Rich's world because questions will arise with
members well ahead of what we discussed today.
                                                                          13.1                                              B5

Did you know the NYTimes has an interview w Scott for tomorrow in which he lays out the policy? How does this affect
