I just spoke to the Ops Center. SEN Levin and I are at the airport in Miami getting ready to leave for Havana. He wanted
to check in with SEC Clinton before he left. Wanted to make sure you heard it from me instead of on Monday via email
or word of mouth.

Hope you're well. Happy New Year!

PS....it's not re: Libya, Jackson-Vanik or a hold on a nomination. ;)
