Cheryl,

Many thanks. We're thrilled that the Secretary will sign the MCC Compact on Saturday, and agree that it's very useful that
the Compact is encouraging the Indonesians to participate in SUN. In fact, we just learned today that they have agreed to
participate, and are working on the official decision.

Warm regards,

Scot

Dear Scot and Daniel,

Many thanks to you and your teams for engaging the Government of Indonesia on the Scaling Up Nutrition movement.

As you know, since UNGA 2010, the Secretary has been championing investment in maternal and child nutrition for its
proven economic returns. The MCC Compact is an important demonstration that countries are prioritizing nutrition
because of its impact on growth, and Indonesia's participation in SUN is a big win in building global momentum.

Best,

cdm
