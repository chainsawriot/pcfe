I am so happy (and mighty relieved) that you thought the odyssey was worth it. They need so much help and I can only
hope they will seek and accept it. Now, my friend, safe travels and I can't wait to hear about the whole adventure.

The conf ended with the Chief of Samoa spontaneously offering a blessing for dear Hillary "who cares about us and
made this possible!" The women have so much potential and this was the right thing to do (and smart thing). As I am
now accustomed to hearing, the embassy said they "learned a lot!"
Exxon's natural gas project is estimated to yield a billion a year for PNG but will the income ever benefit the people?
There are so many challenges here and one can hope this place doesn't become cursed by its resources like DRC etc
because of corruption and lack of accountable govt.
I'm glad you sent me on this long distance trek. I'm convinced we unleashed something good. And now to begin the
long trip home!
