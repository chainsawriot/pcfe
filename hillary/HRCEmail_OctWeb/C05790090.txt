Subject: For your review: draft G8 food security

Hi dear colleagues --

Attached please find the latest draft of the G8 food security remarks for Friday.

As we discussed, this draft makes the brisk case for investments in food security, then drills down on 3 core issues:
nutrition, the private sector, and women. I close with a personal story from her travels, which feels like something
special she can offer that no one else can.

There are a few places where I've asked for some more details from the experts. This is as long as it should be and we
probably want to make it a little shorter.

If anyone has any ideas, large or small, for improving this, I'd be very grateful.

Many thanks,
Megan
