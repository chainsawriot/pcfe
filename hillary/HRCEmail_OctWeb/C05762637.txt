 Madam Secretary,

 Just a quick note before leaving for Moscow, Rome and Central Asia.

 Moscow preparations are in reasonable shape. Afghan lethal transit agreement is done, and will be signed on
 Monday. There's also a broader statement on cooperation on counter-narcotics and reconstruction in
 Afghanistan. (Bakiyev has now signed the Manas agreement, which is a further boost on Afghanistan.)


               The Presidents will announce the bilateral commission, and your trip to Russia in the fall to
 launch the process with Lavrov. All in all, a good, measured, realistic step in our effort to rebuild relations --


I'll be in Rome just for the first, "foreign policy" portion of the G8. We're working on a Leaders' statement that
is likely to look a lot like last week's G8 Foreign Ministers statement on most issues, with an update on
North Korea, and essentially the same, firm line on Iran.

 I leave Rome on July 9 with an interagency delegation for stops in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and
 Kyrgyzstan, back in DC on July 14.

 Hope you had a good Fourth, and all the best,

 Bill
