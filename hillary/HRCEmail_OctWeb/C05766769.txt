We're pushing hard on the nominees and are hopeful they'll move. Leader Reid is anxious to move them, but as you
know, the Republicans aren't very happy with how things are playing out and haven't relented. But we're hopeful things
will get sorted out.

There are about 70 nominees awaiting confirmation administration wide. Sixteen of those are ours (with Tom Shannon
and Raj Shah heading our list). We'll be sure to email you as soon as the logjam breaks.

Have a wonderful Christmas and best wishes to you and your family for a great New Year.

Thanks for everything.

I'm not sure, I couldn't quite make it out. I'll find out.

But it must have been very funny because this crowd is not very happy to be working today, especially at this hour.
Although I'll note (and it shouldn't come as a surprise) that both Senators Coburn and DeMint wanted Leader McConnell
to run out the clock rather than capitulate and agree to an early vote.

Thx--I got up to watch it. What did Reid say while voting that caused laughter?

As expected, the Senate health care bill passed this morning by a vote of 60-39. Senators voted from their desks, and
Vice President Biden presided in the chair.

Senator Bunning did not vote.
