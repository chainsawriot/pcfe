Dave's response to your query:

My team tells me that there are no outstanding qfrs from S appearances last year. We do owe the committee (SFRC)
one qfr from a Steinberg appearance on Libya last May which I understand we only recently received from
them. (Separately, this raises for me the need to limit when they can task us from previous hearings). We also owe Sen
Durbin answers to two questions from Jeff Feltman's appearance last fall on Syria. Bureaus had previously been tasked
with responding to these and both will be taken care of tomorrow.




Makes me wonder about the origin of the Kamen piece and if Lugar's staff are stirring up trouble based on the Steinberg
qfr they only recently tasked us with..
