I just met with the prez of Kosovo. She will be on a panel this morning and staying til the end to hear you. She would
love to see you even for 5 minutes. She is moving ahead on her regional women's conference with a focus on security
and economic issues. As you know, they are hoping you will keynote and hoping to set the date for the conf in the Fall at
a time when you could come.
