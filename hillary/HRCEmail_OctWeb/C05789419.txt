Subject: Myanmar poll body heeds opposition's complaints (AP)

YANGON (AP) - Election authorities have lifted some restrictions on political campaigning after the party of
Myanmar pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi complained.
   Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy said earlier Monday that the rules risked making upcoming by-
elections unfair.
   The Union Election Commission's decision to lift the restrictions was unusually quick for Myanmar.
Bureaucratic wheels grind slowly even where there are no political hurdles in the country where a nominally
civilian government replaced a military one just a year ago.
   The restrictions had prevented political meetings at football fields in three constituencies and in a village in
Kachin state where sporadic fighting has occurred.
