Subject: US to seek new Keystone route, delaying approval (Reuters)

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration plans to announce Thursday it will explore a new route
for a Canada-to-Texas oil pipeline, delaying a final approval beyond the 2012 U.S. election, sources briefed on
the matter said.

   The decision would be a victory for environmentalists, many of whom oppose the pipeline, and a setback for
TransCanada Corp , whose $7 billion Keystone XL project is seen as the most important North American oil
pipeline plan for decades.

  One source familiar with the matter said that studying a new route for the pipeline would likely take 12-18
months, putting a final decision after President Barack Obama's bid for re-election on Nov. 6, 2012.

   If the administration explores a new route, "it's a huge victory, and it would probably be the biggest
environmental gift that President Barack Obama has given us," said Tony Iallonardo, a spokesman at the
National Wildlife Federation.

   Some of Obama's liberal supporters have strongly opposed the project and delaying a decision could allow
Obama to avoid antagonizing environmentalists disillusioned with his progress on climate change. However, it
could also open up a line of attack from Republicans who could argue that a delay will slow job growth.
