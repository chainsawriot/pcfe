> Wanted you to know that I was in Palo Alto for a few days of meetings last week, including a Vital Voices
meeting on technology. I agreed to co-chair the VV tech council with Marissa Mayer of Google and we had the
inaugural meeting at their HQ. The idea is to proactively engage the tech community in working with the VV
network of activists. Candidly it has been a bit of a hard slog to get the leadership at VV to understand the
critical need to make technology an essential component of VV's work if it is to remain relevant. Happy to
report they all now are on board and we are making a lot of progress.

 > I read reports of your remarks in connection with International Women's Day. As you know, I share your
 frustration about the challenges women continue face at home and around the world. The debates in the
 Republican primary are absurd, and would be laughable if it were not so scary. I've attached a copy of a speech
 I gave in Bern a few weeks ago that was quite well received and that I thought you might find interesting. The
 speech was primarily targeted to an audience of Swiss and American business women and the hurdles women
 continue to face as they try move up the corporate ladder.

 > One of the points I tried to make at both Bern and Google is that we seem to be at a pivotal moment in
 history that may present women with some unique opportunities to address the imbalances which have existed
 for too long. As we look around the world, I believe we are beginning to see the emergence of a new paradigm
 of leadership for the twenty first century. A move away from the traditional hierarchical (and male dominated!)
 form of leadership towards one of ever changing coalitions and communities of interest. Been doing lots of
 reading on this topic and it is fascinating. Obviously no one knows where all this is going but if the trend
 continues it might indeed provide new avenues for women. Lots to discuss when we get together.
