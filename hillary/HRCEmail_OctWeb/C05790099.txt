Subject: Iraq court rules to release Hezbollah prisoner (AP)

BAGHDAD (AP) - An Iraqi court declared a Hezbollah commander captured last year and accused of killing
U.S. solders in Iraq in 2007 not guilty for lack of evidence and ruled he be set free.
   The case of Ali Mussa Daqduq has been a thorn in diplomatic relations between Baghdad and Washington
since the American military pullout last December.
   U.S. terror experts have described Daqduq as among "the worst of the worst" militants who would remain a
severe threat to Americans if freed.
   His attorney, Abdul-Mandi al-Mitairi, said an Iraqi judge May 7 found there wasn't enough evidence to keep
Daqduq in jail. The verdict will be appealed automatically.
   Daqduq is a Lebanese commander for Hezbollah, a Shiite militant group linked to numerous deadly attacks.
