No, the foreign ministers largely outrank the defense ministers -- we need their policy guidance in order for the defense
ministers to have cover. But more importantly, we need to consult with the GCC before, not after, the E3+3 talks.

Jeff, explained our conversation to hrc about the proposed second meeting in april with defense teams. She's asking if it
makes sense for the defense teams to meet first to do their technical issues and the foreign ministers meet after once
the detailed defense stuff has worked itself out?
