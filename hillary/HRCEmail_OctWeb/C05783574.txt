Subject: Sudan rebels in Darfur, border states sign alliance (Reuters)

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Rebels in Sudan's Darfur region and troubled southern border states said November
12 they formed an alliance to topple the government of President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, raising the prospect of
more violence in the volatile areas.

      Darfur's main rebel. groups -- the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) and the Sudan Liberation Army
(SLA) -- and the SPLM-N, which fights the army in South Kordofan and Blue Nile, said they had formed a
political and military alliance.

   The alliance is focused on "toppling the regime of the (Sudan's ruling) National Congress Party with all
possible means" and replace it with a democratic system, the groups said in a joint statement sent to Reuters on
Saturday.

   A joint military committee will be formed to coordinate military action against Khartoum, it said, without
elaborating.
