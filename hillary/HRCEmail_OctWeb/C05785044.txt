Hi Cheryl,
Many thanks for all the time, effort and leadership you have put into standing up our new E family.

I am very enthusiastic about this and will do my very best to carry out the Secretary's vision and the mandate of the
QDDR.

This will be one of S's many legacies -- and I want to be sure it is a successful and enduring one.

Again, many thanks for your leadership and efforts. It would never have happened but for you.

Best regards,
Bob
