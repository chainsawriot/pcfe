           term setback from which things are likely to get better for him, that he is facing a longer-term setback from
           which things are unlikely to get better for him, or that he is not facing a setback at this time?

         him, that he is facing a longer-term setback from which things are unlikely to get better for him, or that he is not

   Q20     Generally speaking, do you think of yourself as (ROTATE:) a Democrat, a Republican, an independent, or
           something else? (IF "DEMOCRAT" OR "REPUBLICAN," ASK:) Would you call yourself a strong
           (Democrat/Republican) or not a very strong (Democrat/Republican)? (IF "NOT SURE," CODE AS "NOT
           VERY STRONG DEMOCRAT/REPUBLICAN.") (IF "INDEPENDENT," ASK:) Do you think of yourself as
           closer to the Republican Party, closer to the Democratic Party, or do you think of yourself as strictly

   Q31a As you may know, Congress passed and President Obama signed into law a bill that raises the federal
          government's debt ceiling through the year 2013 and makes major cuts in government spending over the
          next few years. Do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of what was passed? If you do not have
          strong feelings about this, please say so.

           rating, indicating the company sees United States government bonds as no longer among the safest
           investments in the world. Who is most to blame for the S&P credit rating downgrade (ROTATE) President
           Obama, Republicans in Congress, or Democrats in Congress? If you do not have strong feelings about this,
