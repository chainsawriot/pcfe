Hi, Hillary, and Merry Christmas. Hope you and the family are getting a bit of respite from it all. I'm
sending you this message becauseâ€”somewhat to my surprise--Jairam Ramesh has asked me to pass
alon2, a personal message, which is pasted below. I've known him since the 70s




                                                                     Cheers, Strobe


Dear Madam Secretary of State:

It was wonderful catching up with you in Copenhagen. The opportunity to interact with
President Obama and you at the very last minute to salvage the Copenhagen Accord at the
US-BASIC Summit Meeting was fantastic and unforgettable for me personally. I am still
reeling from that historic 75 minutes!!

With greetings for Xmas and best wishes for the New Year,

With warmest regards,

Jairam Ramesh
Minister of Environment and Forests
India
