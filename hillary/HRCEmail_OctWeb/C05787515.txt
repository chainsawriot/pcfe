Ms-
Huma asked me to set up these 2 calls for you tomorrow morning (after your 730 am saakashvilli call):
1.  Sudanese First Vice President Kiir 2.   Mr. Nafie al Nafie, Assistant to President al-Bashir of Sudan

You should have the call sheets soon, if not already. (laura sent them to huma).
Because of the time difference, it may be early morning before we have confirmation on these 2 calls. Ill be sure to let
you know as soon as we have confirmation.
Also, we've been unable to lock in lavrov and al-faisal. Will keep you posted on any developments there, too (although it
seems unlikely for tomorrow morning).
