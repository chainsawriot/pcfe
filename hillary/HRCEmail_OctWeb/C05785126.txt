Subject: Obama signs stopgap measure, awaits spending bill (AP)

WASHINGTON - (AP) President Barack Obama has signed a 24-hour stopgap spending measure to keep the
government operating as he awaits Senate action on a $1 trillion spending bill.
  The House passed the measure Friday following bipartisan negotiations. The bill was expected to clear the
Senate on Saturday.
  The spending bill was one of the final pieces of legislation before Congress, requiring last-minute deal
making to avoid a government shutdown.
  The measure pays for day-to-day operations of 10 Cabinet departments. The bill trims most domestic
agencies and awards the Pentagon the smallest budget hike in recent memory.
