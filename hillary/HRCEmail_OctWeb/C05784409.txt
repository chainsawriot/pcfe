Subject: Germany says Iran sorry for attack on UK embassy (AP)

BERLIN (AP) - German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said the Iranian foreign minister expressed regret
about the storming of Britain's embassy in Tehran by demonstrators.
   The ministry said December 4 Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi said he "was deeply sorry for what
has happened" and vowed "to do everything to prevent such an incident from happening again."
   The ministers were holding bilateral talks in Bonn ahead of a global conference on Afghanistan's future
starting December 5.
   The statement said Westerwelle stressed an attack on one of the European Union's diplomatic missions "is
perceived as being directed against the missions of all EU member states."
   It says Westerwelle has also urged Iran to cooperate with the international community to shed light on its
controversial nuclear program.
