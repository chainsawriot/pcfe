dropping the charges against the 15 doctors and limiting the case to the remaining 5.          t had been a tough battle
but they knew it was the right thing to do.

We are in touch with the doctors and their attorneys to obtain more information -- who are the 5, what will they be
charged with. Details are pending. We'll let you know what we hear.

Thx, Stephanie
