This is really out of my lane, so I'll shut up — and Philippe knows much more about what will generate press than I do. I
just thought the Brookings speech is a good follow-on to the CFR speech and I like her getting out there first as Sec of
State and also on Iran, as her earlier remarks on Iran have already been dominating the news cycle.

We did an iftar so you've checked the box for sucking up to my people.
Honestly, don't think its an issue to do a non-un speech on monday.

DON'T YELL AT ME

All I'm saying is, it's still Eid. So whatever concerns there were about that don't go away.

Personally, I love Monday

Deliver speech on friday in nyc?
Its doable but will be huge pain because she will have to go and come back to dc friday for her day here including fsi
which we would be canceling again. And then leave less than 24 hours later for her weekend home. Lona, will brookings
be ok?

We need to decide if that will work with her schedule and not burn bridges with Brookings.




Huma/Lona: can this work with her schedule; do we have a venue that would work — CFR?




Others — need to decide by early am.

Ben/Jake:




Attached is a first draft of the speech — which has not yet been reviewed by S but given the desire to ensure
coordination, I am sending now. It may change substantially.




The two of you should review carefully and provide edits to ensure a draft that works for everyone and that will be the
draft we share With S.




(Ben —Jake is en route via aircraft so he will be at the Department by 5pm).

This is the current draft. I have highlighted some areas where Bill and Richard need to weigh in on language, tone, and
substance. Still waiting on Mitchell team for precise frame for Middle East graf.
