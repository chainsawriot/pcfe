Subject: Militants attack Iraqi camp housing Iranian exiles (AP)



BAGHDAD (AP) - A        security official says militants have fired a Katyusha rocket at a camp housing several
thousand Iranian exiles in northeastern Iraq.
  The Diyala province official says the attack on Camp Ashraf took place late Tuesday. It was the second
rocket attack on the camp this week. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not
authorized to talk to the media.
  The group said the rocket fell near housing units inside the camp but that there were no casualties.
