The Secretary's Call Sheet for


 Senator Chuck Schumer



Purpose of Call: Senator Schumer requested to speak with you about the reported detention of dual U.S.-Syrian citizen




Background:




                                                  Consul General Andre Goodfriend spoke with the Head of Consular
Affairs by telephone on January 17, stressing the importance of a response. The Head of Consular Affairs had no
information at the time, but said he would ensure that the requests are conveyed to the Ministry of Interior. The Consul
General is currently seeking a meeting with the Head of Consular Affairs to discuss these matters further. The Syrian
government typically gives us access to dual nationals who are in prison on criminal charges. They have not, however,
given us access to U.S. citizens (whether single or dual nationality) who have been arrested on "security" grounds.

With CA concurrence, H informed
                                                           H also informed
