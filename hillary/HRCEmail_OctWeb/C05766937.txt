Madam Secretary,

We appreciate your patience with all this.




We will create an annotated index. We are also re-reading the entire product, including tabs, with fresher eyes this
morning.

Best, Paul

There's a lot of good work in these papers and I thank everyone who helped. I have the following questions:

Why is there overlap btw what we sent over to the NSC already and what we have compiled into the larger
presentation? By my review, Tabs 1, 3, and 6 are in both packages. If we want to include these in both, we need an
annotated index that lists all the papers not just the main tabs.
