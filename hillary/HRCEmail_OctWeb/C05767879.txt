Here are the latest TP ' s on the state of play. May have some updates to go over on
the briefing. PLs don't share these as we'll be constantly updating and want to
make sure people have the most current.

Our pleasure.

But Huma can attest I've used up my juice today, so if we have to re-route her

We're in the air headed back to DC, but State is prepared to host another
State/USAID/DoD briefing tomorrow, again with Counselor Mills, Administrator
Shah, and a rep chosen by DOD. It worked well today, makes sense for tomorrow,
and probably Friday. We can do at whatever time the WH/NSC wants
