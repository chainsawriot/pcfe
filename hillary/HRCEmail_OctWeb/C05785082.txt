I spoke to All Tarhouni this morning. he is planning to visit U.S. maybe as early as december 7-8 and will ask us for
meetings in DC to thank the Administration for all its support. He said he has been asked by Jalil to act as an advisor to
the TNC. In addition, he intends to play a political role by forming some kind of coalition with disparate groups in the
country, especially the militias, to form a bloc for the elections. He is going to Bengazi and said he will try to bring
together the "thuwar" revolutionaries from the west and east and other groups to discuss how best to move forward and
ensure they have a voice. This could be the vehicle he might "guide" into the elections but worries that it could be
hijacked by "elites." He is also considering possibility of forming a political party with them but believes this will take too
much time and there is not enough time left for that.

regarding prospects for the new Cabinet and what it can do in the coming 7 months, he believes it can be a 'service"
government--it can work on the security issue(absorbing "thuwar" into army and security forces), work on economic
issues-liquidity and payments to "thuwar" and martyr families, and prepare for the election. It will not be able to undertake
major decisions such as approving new oil leases, rebuilding infrastructure, or setting out new foreign policy
directions. He reiterated that there must be room given to al-Keeb to implement a strong government without the
interference of the TNC and al-jalil. He said he would use his political voice to remind al-jalil and the TNC that they should
not meddle any longer in affairs regarding the running of the country.
