Subject: Pakistan army chief says PM's criticisms 'divisive' (Reuters)

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's powerful army chief is furious with the prime minister for statements
criticising the army and they should be either clarified or withdrawn, a senior military source told Reuters on
Saturday, piling pressure on the premier.

   "The army chief complained to the president about the prime minister's statements, and said they needed to
be either clarified or withdrawn," the source told Reuters.

    "He said such statements were divisive and made the country more vulnerable."
