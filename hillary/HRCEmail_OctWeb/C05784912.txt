Marc,

German ambassador Koch phoned at 5pm, said that Westerwelle had reached Khar. Ten minute call, cordial.

W made the pitch: that the international community has been trying to ensure that Pakistan's interests are represented
as we work out the future of Afghanistan. It would be a shame if, at this moment, Pakistan would take itself away from
the table.

K said she agreed. She said that during the Defense Committee meeting yesterday, the military had pressed hard for her
to announce that she would not go to Bonn, but that she had been able to prevent that [somewhat more forward
leaning than when I talked to her]. But she was not sure she could sustain that argument in the days ahead.

Ambassador Koch said that the best we could say was that the door is still open, and we need to keep it open as long as
we can. We agreed that with a cabinet meeting Tuesday and a parliamentary session coming this week sometime,
keeping the door open will not be easy. But we should continue to press the Pakistanis to come to Bonn.
