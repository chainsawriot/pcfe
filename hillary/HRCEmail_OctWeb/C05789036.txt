Cheryl,

I wanted to share with you an email Rick Ruth sent me on this subject/dispute over Gasland, as I asked his
opinion. He's response is thoughtful and the only leg I think we can stand on. See below.




          Overall, I think "accuracy" is almost a red herring dragged across the trail and that getting into a
          discussion/dispute about individual points of fact is (1) not our job and (2) likely to cloud the
          larger issues. Films, including documentary films, are a form of artistic and cultural
          expression. They are not pure fiction or artistry, but neither are they meant to be a classroom
          lecture, the nightly news or the police blotter. Every documentary film is someone's
          interpretation of reality. They are inherently tendentious; they have a point-of-view. And to be
          interesting, gripping, persuasive, provocative, they must have a recognizable perspective. The
          filmmaker (artist) is allowed to juxtapose images, play with time, caricature, and distort to make
          a point. Sophisticated audiences understand this—and unsophisticated audiences should be
          taught it.
          Who decides if a film (painting, sculpture, photo, song) is art. Not solely government
          functionaries, that's why we work with USC (BAM, Met, Kennedy Center, Lincoln
          Center...). Opinions don't need to be unanimous (an impossibility in any case). What counts is
          that recognized professionals and bodies of experts find merit and quality in a film. Gasland, as
          you know, has received the following accolades:
              • 2010 Environmental Media Award for Best Documentary Feature
              • 2010 Sundance Film Festival Special Jury Prize
              • 2010 Big Sky Documentary Film Festival Artistic Vision award
              • 2010 Thin Line Film Festival Audience Award
              • 2010 Yale Environmental Film Festival Grand Jury Prize
              • 2010 Sarasota Film Festival Special Jury Prize
              • 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for Nonfiction Programming
                   (Josh Fox)

           It was also nominated for a 2011 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature and 2011
           Writer's Guild Award or Best Documentary Screenplay.

 For me, that settles the issue of artistic merit.
 As for the debate, it will continue regardless of what we do. Energy in Depth, an oil and gas
 industry group, posted a list of alleged factual inaccuracies. The Gasland posted a point-by-
 point rebuttal. So it goes.
 What matters to me is:

     •    Gasland represents an important point of view that is part of an ongoing debate in the
         United States.
     •    With or without disputed portions, it is certainly solidly within the responsible spectrum
         of the debate and is worthy of viewing and consideration.
     •    Making it available underscores our commitment to freedom of expression.
     •    Our posts choose. And they choose based on their foreign policy/public diplomacy
         needs and goals. Our job is to support their efforts.
     •    Our government has a long history of airing diverse and controversial opinions. If we
         did not do so, then our products might justifiably be accused of being little more than
         propaganda.

  One thought—as I climb down from my high horse--when we offer the films, do we provide any
  kind of synopsis of commentary and reaction along with film to help posts judge (sight unseen in
  many cases) if the film is right for the audience and purpose the have in mind? If so, we could
  note-- in the Gasland portion—that there is strong controversy and even provide the industry link
  and the Gasland link.

  Cheers,
  Rick
