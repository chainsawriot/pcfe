The fmr VP called in, very upbeat, to report he had a successful three-hour meeting with          oday. He gave             B1
suggested message and they discussed next steps.                                                                            1.4(D)




VP Gore:
-- will contact the families to say he's working on a diplomatic track and urge they hold off on doing press for time
being;

-- said Leon Fuerth will work the details going fwd and will accompany him;
-- asked abt likelihood of getting a plane and mentioned need for an interpreter.

I told him we would follow up with        to get a sense of timing and would begin to rough out details/logistics for trip in
anticipation it will be greenlighted by Pyongyang. I thanked the VP for his call, related the Secretary's concern for both
the detained reporters and their families, and said we'd be back in touch with him very soon.
