Madame Secretary

We may have made a breakthrough with China on cookstoves. Following my visit to Beijing last month, your letter to
Dai last week (inviting China to join the Alliance), and Melanne's discussion with Councilor Liu yesterday, China's MFA
today requested information from Embassy Beijing on the process for joining the Alliance.
