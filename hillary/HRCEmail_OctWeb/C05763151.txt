Let's try it but I'd be more inclined to include his thoughts when there is a disagreement that needs airing. And I totally
agree we need to change to Tues.

Yes, we are already working on this.
                                                     We'll see what comes of that.

Also, Holbrooke is very concerned about losing his direct channel, though he agrees the report should be in your name.
The proposed approach is to allow him to put his own analysis on certain issues in a tab to your memo. What are your
thoughts on this?

                                                            Can you confirm and direct the drafting. It will go in
under my name from now on but needs to be prepared by Holbrooke and team for our review, editing and additions.

Gates and I just agreed to share our reports w each other which will be very helpful.
