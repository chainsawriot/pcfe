This makes sense to me -- and I certainly trust your judgment as to how best to deliver such a message (I.e., doing it
jointly).

Subject: Meeting with Pm

My UK and French colleagues and I are concerned about the continuing reticence/inability of this government to
undertake decisionmaking at the highest levels. It is having a negative impact on this country's ability to move forward
and exposing it to continuous attacks-both verbal and physical from its opponents and the general public. We have
bandied about the idea that we three might try to take the PM aside in an informal chat, lay out for him our concerns,
get his unvarnished take on the situation, and see if there is anything we can do to help him through this critical period. I
hopeful! will see the PM tomorrow about the Washington trip and may raise this with him privately.
