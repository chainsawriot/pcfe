From:                             Sullivan, Jacob J <SullivanJJ@state.gov>
Sent:                             Sunday, May 6, 2012 10:21 PM

Subject:                          Dan Smith's take on Greek elections




This does not bode well for the ability of the new government to meet the demanding terms of the second bailout
package. I am sure some Greeks believe that with this election and Hollande's election in France, the EU will have to
reconsider its austerity focus, but I suspect not much will change for Greece.                                              1.4(D)
                                                                                                                            B1

While we all hope for the best and hope that this result shocks the mainstream politicians into cooperating more closely,
I suspect we may be in for a period of uncertainty before a new government is formed. Whatever coalition emerges,
moreover, will have little margin for defections.



I should add that it is not out of the question that no one will be able to form a government and we will have elections
again in another month.
