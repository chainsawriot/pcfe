Subject: Taiwanese official accused of abusing housekeeper (AP)

KANSAS CITY (AP) - A Taiwanese official accused of underpaying and overworking her housekeeper has
been jailed in Kansas City.
   She faces a federal labor charge that experts say has rarely, if ever, been applied to a foreign official.
   Hsien-Hsien Liu is director general of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Kansas City. The office
maintains unofficial relations between the United States and Taiwan and is similar to a foreign government
consulate, although the U.S. doesn't recognize Taiwan as a sovereign state.
   Liu was arrested Thursday and is being held without bond until a hearing Wednesday. Court records do not
list an attorney for her.
   Prosecutors say Liu's case is unique because she is charged with fraudulently recruiting her housekeeper to
come to the U.S. as well as mistreating her.
