Subject: Explosions, gunfire heard in northeast Nigeria (AP)


GOMBE (AP) - Witnesses say numerous explosions, followed by gunfire, has echoed through a state capital in
northeast Nigeria previously targeted by a radical Islamist sect.
  An AP reporter in Gombe, the capital of Gombe state, said Friday that she heard the explosions around
evening prayers. People fled the violence as gunfire rang out throughout the city.
  It was unclear what happened as authorities would only say the situation was "very bad." However, Gombe
and the surrounding region has been under increasingly bloody attacks by a radical sect known as Boko Haram.
