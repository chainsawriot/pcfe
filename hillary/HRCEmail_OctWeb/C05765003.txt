Brooke


Thanks for the update. I appreciate it. I think we are in as good as place now with all things considered as we can be on
Sudan




Given the materials your team is seeking to prepare her, I wanted to re-raise this expectation to see if there was any
different expectations on your team.

Thanks.

Hi Cheryl,
Just wanted to give you a quick note on where we are for trip.
Speech is still a work in progress — I will send you a draft as soon as we have one that's presentable. Been working with
NEA/Mara and others. Deeply appreciate all the help.
Susan will talk with Mitchell tomorrow. Obviously, our trip not focused on MEPP, but they are talking just to make sure
that we are synched up.

Got a readout from Erica on Sudan meeting. Sounds like it ended up in a good place.

Let me know if there's any additional info that would be helpful.
Hope you are well.
Brooke
