Jake, a proposed statement on Tunisia is being sent forward now. But given what.happened in Tunisia today, we believe
it is important for S to reach out to FM Morjane now and express our support. This seismic change is going to be
difficult and the US should stand up with them. We are working a memo through the system, but it will take a while -
hence my email to you now. As disgusting as we found the Ben Ali regime, it is important that the interim government
gets off to a solid start, acting quickly to restore calm and security to the streets. It then can begin implement long
overdue political and economic reforms so necessary to the country's stability. Our support to these endeavors are
critical and an early outreach to the FM — and other gestures — will be important in setting the stage.




Suggested talking points for S
