Thx for the firsthand report--I had heard he was unusually good in Davos. Must be the mountain air! I need some for
sure.

Your husband's remarks in answer to questions from Schwab here in Davos today were exceptional in every way. He was
reflective, expansive, knowledgeable, funny --and he looked terrific. He just gets better and better. Everyone seemed to
be talking about him at once tonight.
At the end of a discourse that covered Israel and Palestine, the rioting in arab states, the off-year election, optimism
about america, the deficit and the economy, health care, trade, etc., he was asked what his hopes were for the next 10
years. He said," to be alive, to be a grandfather and to have a happy wife ---and that means that she becomes a
grandmother which she cares about more than anything! To be grateful for each day and make a difference." He then
said that he hoped to live to see the day when countries came together and make consistently good decisions. This came
after a discussion on the Hubble Telescope and semiconductor and what it's going to tell us about our remarkable world.
He ended by saying "This is an exciting time to be alive!"

Everywhere I go people want to tell me what a great job you're doing from Republicans to foreigners to your loyal
followers. The pressures have got to be even greater, however, with what's happening in the Arab world. I feel like you
predicted it in your Doha remarks.

There are many companies who want to partner with us and I'm eager to raise more money for our Fund. I did a press
conference in Istanbul with our Avon and other Secretary's Fund grantees and could see agin what a difference it makes.
It's also good PD. The Istanbul conference was a big successes. Thank you for doing the video.

Sincerely,
Your reporter
