TEHRAN (Reuters) - Iran's response to the downed US drone's violation of its airspace will not be limited to
the country's borders, a military source told state television.

   "The Iranian military's response to the American spy drone's violation of our airspace will not be limited to
Iran's borders any more," Iran's Arabic language Al Alam television quoted the military source as saying,
without giving details.

   Iran said in July it had shot down an unmanned US spy plane over the holy city of Qom, near its Fordu
nuclear site.
