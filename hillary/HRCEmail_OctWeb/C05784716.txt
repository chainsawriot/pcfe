Subject: UN urges halt to killings in Yemen, access for aid (Reuters)

GENEVA, Dec 6 (Reuters) - The United Nations called on all factions in Yemen on Tuesday to cease deadly
attacks on civilians and urged the government to allow access for aid supplies and U.N. human rights
monitors.

   "We condemn continuing attacks on civilians particularly in Taiz where we are seeing reports that 22 people
have been killed in shooting and shelling since Thursday (Dec. 1), including two children," Ravina Shamdasani,
a spokeswoman for U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay, told a news briefing.

   "The continued use of disproportionate force on the part of the government forces despite commitments
made to investigate serious human rights violations is extremely disappointing," she said. "We urge all sides to
halt the use of violent force."

   Forces loyal to outgoing Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh shot dead a woman in a protest march in Taiz
on Monday, witnesses and activists said, despite tanks withdrawing under a ceasefire pact.
