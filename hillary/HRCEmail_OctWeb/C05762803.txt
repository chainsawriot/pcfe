OK, also want to fill you in on what's going on inside Downing Street now. Shaun Woodward also
says you will be needed very soon to make calls to McGuinness and Robinson. He will send me
memo on this. See you also at Melanne's swearing in.

Can National Security Adviser James Jones Survive a Second Round of Attacks and

"Longer Knives"? <http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-clemons/can-national-security-
adv b 214672.html>




I am here in London where I'm participating in an interesting forum

<http://www.rusi.org/events/ref:E49E8489274858/> sponsored by the Princeton

Project on National Security <http://www.princeton.edu/%7Eppns/aboutuS.html>

and the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) Transatlantic Program

<http://www.rusi.org/go.php?structureID=S433ACD38E8CE9&ref=> , I've received not

just one email -- but three -- from prominent insider journalists and policy

hands that Jim Jones' tenure as National Security Adviser is highly fragile.

One of these emails reports starkly:



    Knives getting longer



That's all my contact said. But other emails have intimated to me a serious

tone-deafness by Jones about his role and responsibilities, his relationship

with the President, and his relationship with younger, dedicated, hardworking

and late-working staff. Jones recently said that National Security Council staff

members that stayed longer than 7:30 pm must be disorganized in their work.

I speak to various NSC officials -- often at 10:00 or 11:00 pm at night. They

are hardworking, racing as fast as they can to manage the many, many, many major

initiatives that Barack Obama has decided to simultaneously pursue.

James Jones is considered by his admirers to be a genius when thinking about

management structures and decision-making processes. On the other hand, his

critics see him as a plodding, slow-moving, out of touch retired general who was

better prepared to think about the last era rather than the one we are moving

into. His critics think that he's just too unable to animate nimble, high flex

policy decision making products for a White House on a manic dash to get a lot

of top tier issues dealt with.

Friends at the National Security Council respect a great deal the way in which

NSC Deputy Tom Donilon is managing his brief. Many see him picking up the load

that Jones seems unable or unwilling to carry. Donilon is deeply engaged in the

broad Middle East and Iran portfolio, the non-proliferation/WMD/arms control

portfolio, the China economic and security portfolio, and he has -- according to

reports -- supported and helped cultivate relationship building between State,

DoD, the NSC, and other parts of the national security bureaucracy.

Some tell me that James Jones decided to try and remove himself from the

"whack-a-mole" crisis reaction style of decision-making that could rob the Obama

administration of the chance to define a new course in national security

affairs. Tom Donilon, according to reports, wields far more the hand of power

when it comes to day to day management and responding to crises that require

presidential attention and response.

Jones, in contrast, has been obsessed with the structure of decisions -- who is

involved in those decisions, what the structure of decision-making should be,

and what legal modifications to this process need to be made. He looks at that

as the big nut that needs to be cracked -- and that would improve, according to

Jim Jones, the President's effectiveness and chances of success at a macro

level.

Jones' self-determined task is not high profile, mostly structural, and has not

won him many admirers for leadership -- but what he is doing is necessary. If he

departs his role, this challenge of dealing with the growing complexity of

national security threats and the vital need to recalibrate the policy making

and decision-making process will require the attention of someone serious.

So, whether Jones stays or goes -- his portfolio will remain vital.

But what is clear is that Jones has enemies and that they are trying to

undermine his place in the Obama orbit.

Their motives may not be earnest concern about the tempo or pace of Jones'

management style -- but they very well could be his unwillingness to allow the

liberal interventionists inside the Obama administration to have more than their

fair share of power in the Obama decision-making process.

Jones has structured an all views on the table approach to decision making --

quite evident when it comes to Middle East policy -- and the

hawkish/neocon-friendly/Likudist-hugging part of the Obama administration's

foreign policy operation may be engaged in a coup attempt against Jones.

I don't know if he'll survive this latest effort to oust him -- but folks need

to know that those "longer knives", on the whole, do not have pure motives.
