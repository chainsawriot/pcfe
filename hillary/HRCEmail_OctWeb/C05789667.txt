FYSA, if true, this is a big tactical military victory for the TFG and Ethiopia. The "Somalia soldiers" fighting with the
Ethiopians are Somali militias trained by Ethiopia but aligned with the TFG, and the TFG supports this operation. Baidoa
is the most important city, politically and economically, in southern Somalia (it's where the TFG was based until AMISOM
secured Mogadishu in 2009) besides the port of Kismayo, so this would be a big military gain. Would mean the only big
city AS still controls in Somalia is Kismayo, plus some other medium-sized ones.

MOGADISHU (AP) - Residents say Ethiopian troops and Somali soldiers have seized a key town in south
central Somalia.
   Baidoa resident Isaq Haji says tanks and infantry troops swept into the town on Wednesday after a gunfight.
He said al-Shabab fighters retreated into jungle areas outside the town, about 160 miles (256 kilometers)
northwest of Mogadishu.
   Haji said the fighting had stopped, but gunfire could still be heard.
   In a website statement, al-Shabab confirmed the seizure of the town, saying their fighters conducted a tactical
retreat. Baidoa is a major base for al-Shabab.
   Resident Tifow Abdi says he joined hundreds of others who fled the fighting.
   Ethiopian and pro-government troops seized two villages earlier this week in a push aimed at capturing
Baidoa.
