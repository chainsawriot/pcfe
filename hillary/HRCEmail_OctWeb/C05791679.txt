Subject: First freely elected Tunisian govt sworn in (AP)


TUNIS (AP) - Tunisia's first freely elected government has been sworn in following a popular uprising earlier
this year.
   The new government led by moderate Islamist party Ennanda received a vote of confidence in parliament
December 23 and was sworn in December 24.
   Tunisia threw off decades of authoritarian rule in January and held widely praised elections, but Prime
Minister Hamadi Jebali warned the country faces many challenges: high unemployment, pockets of unrest and a
stagnating economy.
   Tunisia's democratic transition is being closely watched since its revolt led to a rash of similar uprisings
across the Arab world.
   Its new government is still only temporary, running the country until a new constitution is written and another
round of elections held.
