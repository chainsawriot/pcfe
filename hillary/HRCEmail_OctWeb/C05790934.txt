GENEVA (Reuters) - The Syrian Arab Red Crescent began evacuating wounded or sick women and children
from the Baba Amro district of the besieged city of Horns, the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC) said.

   "Syrian Arab Red Crescent teams have started evacuating women and and children, the operation is
underway," ICRC chief spokeswoman Carla Haddad told Reuters in Geneva. "The evacuation operation started
with SARC ambulances that entered Baba Amro."

  There was no immediate information from the humanitarian agency's teams on the ground as to whether
wounded foreign journalists were among them, she said.
