Subject: RE: Mojadeddi resigns?

Jim,

Ambassador Crocker was scheduled to meet Mojaddedi today, but the meeting was unfortunately canceled. I
just got off the phone, however, with Mojaddedi's representative here in Kabul. He told me that the press
reports are true. According to his representative, Mojaddedi resigned from the HPC, the Senate, and from the
Independent Dispute Resolution Commission,                                                                           1.4(D)
                                                                                                                     B1

                              Hope this helps. I can also send you a copy of the resignation letter in Dari if you
need it.

Best,

Josh
