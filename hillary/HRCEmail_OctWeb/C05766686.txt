Thanks Madame Secretary -- preferably before January 1 to allow us time to get ready for your visit.




                                          A call in the next eight days or so would be fine. Thanks very much and don't
hesitate to contact us if you need anything further. Best Kurt

Kurt--

  I just received your request that I call Sec. Gates re our mil-mil relations. He is on vacation and it may take a few days
to schedule a non-urgent call. What is our timeline on this? HRC
