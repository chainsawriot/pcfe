Bill Clinton Speaks On 2012, 2016 Elections

WASHINGTON -- Former President Bill Clinton said he believes President Barack Obama can win re-election
if he can persuade voters he steadied a shaky economy.

Clinton told ABC's "Good Morning America" he believes likely Republican nominee Mitt Romney will have a
difficult time reconciling positions he's taken during the primary season with what he'll say against Obama in
the fall.

"Mr. Romney has a different challenge than I did. Mine was just one long character attack. We never had to
change what we were saying from the primary to the general," said the former president.

Clinton sounded off on Romney adviser Eric Fehrnstrom's recent infamous Etch A Sketch gaffe. "The poor man
who got in trouble for the Etch A Sketch remark -- that's like the saying, 'There is nothing more damaging in
politics than telling the truth,'" he said. "I mean, the truth is, that's what he's gotta do."

Clinton was asked if Obama can argue that Americans are better off than they were four years ago, as he argued
in winning re-election in 1996.

He replied that if Obama can't make that case, "it is only because of the financial collapse that occurred in
September 2008" before Obama took office.

Clinton said Obama can assert that "we put a floor under the recession and kept is from becoming a depression."

Clinton was also asked if his wife, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, will run for president again in 2016,
which she has repeatedly denied. "I don't know. It's entirely up to her. I'm glad she's coming home. I miss her.
We have fun together. She wants to come home and decompress," said Clinton. "I believe she's being absolutely
honest with you when she says she doesn't think she'll go back to politics. If she comes home and we do this
foundation stuff for the rest of our lives, I'll be happy. If he changes her mind and decides to run, I'll be happy.
But I think that's light years away."
