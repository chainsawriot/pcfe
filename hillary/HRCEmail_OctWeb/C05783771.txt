Subject: Syrian official agrees 'in principle' to observers (AP)



BEIRUT (AP) - A Syrian official says Damascus has agreed "in principle" to allow an Arab League observer
mission into the country.
  But the official said Friday that Syria was still studying the details. The official asked not to be named
because the issue is so sensitive.
  The Arab League suspended Syria earlier this week over its deadly crackdown on an eight-month-old
uprising. The 22-member body has proposed sending hundreds of observers to the country to try to help end the
bloodshed.
  The U.N. estimates some 3,500 people have been killed in the crackdown.
