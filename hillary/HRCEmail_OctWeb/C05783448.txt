LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister David Cameron said that the death of former Libyan
leader Muammar Gaddafi held out the promise of a better future for the people he ruled for four decades.

  "People in Libya today have an even greater chance after this news of building themselves a strong and
democratic future," he said in a statement in Downing Street.
