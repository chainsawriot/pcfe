Raj â€”


I look forward to sitting down with you when things quiet down, but I just wanted to flag two things for you. First, we
have a ticket for you in the visitor's gallery for State of the Union. If you're available to attend tomorrow night, I'll have
my staff contact your staff to make the arrangements.
