  This is so very, very sad. But she never, ever even to the end was a "dying" person -- she lived vibrantly, fully,
  heartily all the way through, with courage, panache, joy and generosity.

Dear Friends,
Laura passed away last night at 11:25. It was a peaceful end

                                                                 There were so many places she wanted to go and
"projects" that she wanted to accomplish before she learned only eight weeks ago that her life was suddenly measured in
a few months.

Dear Friends of Laura,

   Many of you have asked about Laura's status, and the answer is that Laura is still hanging on thouah
continuing to decline slowly. At this point, she is comatose
