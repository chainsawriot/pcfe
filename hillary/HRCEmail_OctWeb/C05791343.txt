Subject: Syria condemns meeting with opposition in Tunis (Reuters)

BEIRUT, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Syria condemned statements issued by participants at the "Friends of Syria"
conference in Tunis, official state television said on Saturday, dubbing the gathering of the opposition and
Western and Arab states as "the enemies of Syria" meeting.

   "Syria rejects all that was said and issued at the meeting for the enemies of Syria in Tunis," Syria TV
reported in an urgent news break. "Syria deplores all voices calling for financing the armed groups which could
lead to support for terrorism and hurt the interests of the Syrian people."
