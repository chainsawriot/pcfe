Subject: changes to clearance process/templates

Colleagues:

We want to bring to your attention two changes in requirements for formatting/clearing paper for the Secretary, Deputy
Secretaries, Under Secretary for Political Affairs, and the Counselor.

The Line will no longer require the clearance of a parent Under Secretary's office when one of its constituent bureaus
has cleared (for example, J clearance if DRL cleared the paper, or E clearance if ENR cleared). The Line will continue to
require D(B), D(N), and P clearance for all papers, but other Under Secretaries' clearances will be required only if they
have an equity in a particular issue. This change is part of an effort to streamline the clearance process, and allow
bureau drafters to move quality paper to principals more efficiently and quickly.

Additionally, we have updated our templates on Infolink to include paragraph classification markings for all
papers. Thanks in advance for helping us comply with this important government-wide requirement.

Best regards,

Joan C. Perkins
Deputy Director of the Line (S/ES-S)
202-647-9936
