              A couple of things:

                  1. The ASSK call sheet is in the front pocket of the binder. This call
                     is tentatively scheduled for 9:30 p.m. tonight. Claire will confirm.

                  2. There is an action memo in the front pocket of the binder that they
                     are asking you approve tonight. Please let me know and we can get
                     the memo to the White House.


              3. Isabelle is confirmed for 7am tomorrow.
