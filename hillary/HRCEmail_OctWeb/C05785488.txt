Subject: UN envoy vows to stay in Afghanistan despite attack (Reuters)



KABUL,   April 2 (Reuters) - The top U.N. diplomat in Kabul said on Saturday the United Nations would stay in
Afghanistan despite the death of seven staffers in the worst attack against the world body in the country.

   U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura said Friday's attack on the mission in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif
"should not deter the U.N. presence, activities in this country in this delicate and particularly crucial period".

   De Mistura flew to Mazar-i-Sharif to handle the aftermath of the attack, when protesters enraged by the
burning of a Koran by a radical fundamentalist Christian in the U.S. overran the mission and murdered seven
foreign staff.

   He told a small group of journalists in the Afghan capital on Saturday that international staff would be
temporarily deployed to Kabul until office was rebuilt.
