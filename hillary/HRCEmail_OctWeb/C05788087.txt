BEHIND THE CURTAIN - JAMES FALLOWS cover story in The Atlantic, "Obama, explained: Chess
master - or pawn?": "Like [Bill] Clinton and unlike George W. Bush, Barack Obama is said to be a night owl.
But in the wee hours, Clinton would be on the phone, playing cards with friends, gabbing ... Obama is more
likely to be spending time with papers or a book, or even to be online - prowling through the same blogs and
news sites as the rest of us ...

"Shortly after William Daley ... succeeded Emanuel, ... he came to Obama with his initial report. You are
reeling, he said ... Part of the problem is that the team around you is not good enough. To raise your game, you
have to surround yourself with the best people available. There have to be changes. Obama thought about it, and
reportedly called Daley back in a few days later. 'I like my team,' he said. 'I am comfortable with who I have
around me. Just so there's no miscommunication, I'm saying that I like this team.' (The White House declined to
comment on the episode)." Online soon
