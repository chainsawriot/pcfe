Subject: Musharraf: US-Pakistan relationship at new low (AP)


LITTLE ROCK (AP) - Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf says the relationship between Pakistan and
the United States is at its lowest point and plagued by "total mistrust."
   Musharraf told an audience in Arkansas Thursday that the Pakistani military was guilty of "terrible
negligence" in allowing Osama bin Laden to go undetected before he was killed in a U.S. raid in May. And he
says Pakistan hasn't done enough to target Taliban-affiliated militants known as the Haqqani network.
   But Musharraf says U.S. leaders are wrong to accuse Pakistan of aiding militants. He blames American
mistakes in Afghanistan for the Taliban's re-emergence.
