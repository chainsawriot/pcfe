Subject: Top Israeli court gives green light for Shalit swap (Reuters)

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's Supreme Court gave the green light on Monday for a prisoner exchange with
Hamas, rejecting petitions against the deal to swap hundreds of jailed Palestinians for captive Israeli soldier
Gilad Shalit, officials said.

   The court had been widely expected not to intervene, and the trade is due to take place on Tuesday. The
appeals were lodged by relatives of Israelis killed in attacks carried out by some of the prisoners due to be
released.
