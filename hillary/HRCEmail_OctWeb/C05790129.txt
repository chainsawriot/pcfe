Subject: Israeli media: Early election canceled (AP)



JERUSALEM (AP) - Israeli media reports indicate that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reached
agreement with the Kadima opposition party for a unity government, canceling early election.
  There was no immediate comment from official sources on the decision that was reported early on the
morning of May 8.
  The reports came as Israel's parliament held debates long into the night over whether to disperse ahead of
early elections called for the fall.
   Earlier in the day, the Israeli government proposed the election be moved up to September 4.
  The election had originally been set for 2013.
  But disagreements on a variety of domestic issues such as drafting the ultra-Orthodox into the military and
the fate of outposts and settlements in the West Bank have led Netanyahu to bring the date forward.
