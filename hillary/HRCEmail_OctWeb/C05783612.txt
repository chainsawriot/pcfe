Subject: Turkey to evacuate families of diplomatic staff in Syria (Reuters)



ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey has decided to evacuate the families of its diplomatic staff in Syria after
protesters attacked its missions in the country but diplomatic staff will remain, broadcaster CNN Turk reported
November 13.

   A crowd of around 1,000 attacked the Turkish embassy in Damascus in the evening of November 12,
throwing stones and bottles before Syrian police intervened to break up the protest, Turkey's state-run Anatolian
news agency said
