Subject: Saudi prince resigns from succession commission (AP)


RIYADH (AP) - A Saudi prince known as rebellious member of the royal family has resigned from . a
commission in charge of selecting the oil-rich kingdom's future kings.
  Talal bin Abdel-Aziz Al Saud, the king's half brother, said Wednesday on his official website that he
submitted his resignation to King Abdullah. He didn't give reasons.
  The resignation indicated a power struggle within the ruling Saudi family. Talal criticized what he called a
monopoly on Saudi power by an unnamed faction within the royal family in remarks published in 2007.
  The 35-member Allegiance Commission of the sons and grandsons of Saudi Arabia's founder was formed in
2006 to ensure smooth transfer of power. Abdullah is 87.
  Last month Crown Prince Sultan died and was replaced by conservative Prince Nayef, who is 78.
