Jake/Huma:

S can remind Amorim that the parties agreed of their own free will to the restitution article (Article 5) in TSJA. That is
being fulfilled in Dec 2 vote. Article 5 did NOT say that vote had to be before elections, and Z told us privately he knew
that it would be impossible to do vote before Nov 29 elections. This is the only realistic path to Z restitution -- Amorim
should urge Z to cooperate. He has a chance. ck

Subject: Lula letter

Jake:

Text is in Portuguese. Part on Honduras talks about need to set correct anti-coup precedent in region. Lula ready for
dialogue and thanks US for support for Brazilian emb in Honduras. But cites Rio Group declaration calling for Z
restitution before elections if elections are to be legit.

Will send this now and summarize other parts next.
