Subject:                         Palestinian ESF




We've just heard from Fayyad's office that Netanyahu just called him, to relay that he has given instructions to
the Israeli Embassy in Washington to call whomever they need to on the Hill in order to get the hold on the ESF
lifted. Unclear whether the Israeli message will be to lift the hold on all of the ESF, or some portion of it. Nides
trying to reach Oren.
