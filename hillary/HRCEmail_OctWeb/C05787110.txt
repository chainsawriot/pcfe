Subject: Strong earthquake jolts northeastern Japan (AP)

TOKYO (AP) - Japan's Meteorological Agency says a strong earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.5
has jolted northeastern Japan, the same region devastated by March's massive quake and tsunami.
  There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage from the Saturday afternoon quake, and no tsunami
warning was issued.
  The quake was centered 25 miles (40 kilometers) below the sea bed in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of
Miyagi prefecture _ in the same area where more than 22,000 people were killed or went missing after the
March 11 quake and tsunami.
