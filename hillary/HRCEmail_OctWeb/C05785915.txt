Subject: Darfur rebels confirm death of their leader (AP)



   CAIRO - (AP) The main Darfur rebel group has confirmed that its leader, Khalil Ibrahim, has been killed.
   The Justice and Equality Movement, said in a statement posted on its website that Ibrahim was killed early
Friday when his camp was attacked by a plane.
   Sudan announced Sunday that its forces killed Ibrahim, calling his death a serious blow to JEM, which has
threatened to attack the Sudanese capital in the past. JEM has continued its fight against Sudan despite a peace
accord signed by other groups.
   The Sudanese army said Ibrahim was wounded in fighting on Thursday and died of his wounds Saturday.
   The JEM statement Monday vowed that "the martyr's blood will not be wasted, and those who killed him will
pay the price more than double."
