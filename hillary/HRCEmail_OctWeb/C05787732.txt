Subject: Crisis in Abyei, Sudan

Dear Madame Secretary:

A major crisis has erupted in Abyei in the past 24 hours. A SPLA (south Sudan army) force attacked an
UNMIS convoy carrying north Sudan (SAF) soldiers, wounding several SAF soldiers and an UNMIS
member. This is the second unwarranted SPLA attack on SAF members in May, the last attack having
killed eleven SAF. The SAF has responded to this latest attack by moving more troops into Abyei and
reportedly bombing two villages. We are facing a threat of major war breaking out in Abyei,
threatening the entire CPA negotiations.




If it is at all possible, we would like you to make some of these calls today. We are working with you
staff to see if your schedule permits and to provide you with the necessary background and talking
points. I will keep you informed of developments throughout the day.          •

Thank you.
