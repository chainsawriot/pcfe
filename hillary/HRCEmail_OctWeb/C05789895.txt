                               ul    City-wide Attacks - 04152012

Complex Attack Sites:

          1. At present, both Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police are heavily engaged with eight
             insurgents at Parliament on Darulaman Road.
          2. Afghan National Security Forces are also engaged with four insurgents at a three-story building behind the
             Kabul Star. Security forces have cleared two of three floors. As government forces attempt to clear the third
             and final floor of the building, small arms fire is likely to increase significantly. One of the four has been
             killed and one is wounded.
          3. Fighting IVO Camp Warehouse remains ongoing with Afghan forces engaged with three insurgents.

Thus far, eleven insurgents have been detained, two of whom had allegedly been wearing suicide vests and were
planning to target Second Vice President Khalili.

Again, small arms fire remains ongoing at each of the attack sites.
