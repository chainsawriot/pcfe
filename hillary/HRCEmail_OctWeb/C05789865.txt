Lynn-

I'm out of the country during the 16-20th but let's try for another time. I'm copying Cheryl to ask her to find a time for
the three of us to meet. Cheers from Cartagena!

Hi Hillary,
Trust all is well.
I have done some thinking about the ideas we discussed at dinner a couple of months ago.
I have some further thoughts that I would love to run by you.
Any chance you are free in DC at any time from the 16-20th of May?
Or, any time or place that works for you.
Lots of Love,
Lynn
