This reminds me that Yang asked me if we'd support Ban for reelection, and I said we would. He seemed relieved since
he said they thought he'd done a good job and wanted to know if we agreed because "if China and the US agreed, then
we could work w other members." It's my understanding that we already decided to support Ban and didn't believe
there was any opposition.

Jake,

I understand that S is meeting with Japanese FM Maehara tomorrow, and wanted to make you aware of news reports
today indicating that Japan plans to announce shortly its intention to run for a UN Security Council seat for 2012-2013.
Having just left the Council after a 2009-2010 term, this would be the earliest opportunity for Japan to seek another
seat, and likely represents a strategy of seeking frequent election to a nonpermanent UNSC seat to bolster Japan's
credibility in its pursuit of permanent Security Council membership. To date, Fiji, Kyrgyzstan, and Pakistan have
announced their candidacy for a single Asia Group seat up in 2012. Japan has served ten times on the Council, tied for
the most with Brazil.

Esther
