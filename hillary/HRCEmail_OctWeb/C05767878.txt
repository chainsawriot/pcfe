Subject: U.S. Supreme Court dismisses Uighurs' appeal in detention case (U)




                                     :J;10111E''
(U) The court said seven Chinese Muslims detained at Guantanamo Bay for the eight years have been offered relocation
elsewhere, and therefore declined to rule on whether federal judges have the authority to release them into the United
States. The Office of the Legal Advisor notes a court ruling on the case might have hampered broader efforts to resettle
former detainees in other countries.
