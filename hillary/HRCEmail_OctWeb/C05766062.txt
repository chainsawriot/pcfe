I know I'm stating the obvious, but it's a temperamental and sensitive crowd. Of course, they don't latch on to all the great
things she said about USAID last week at her hearings. They just harp on the comments taken out of context.

I agree with Caitlin -- if we can get a line or two in her testimony next week, maybe it can help soothe them. And of
course, a couple of lines in her Raj confirmation remarks.

Thanks.

Subject: IMP: USAID/HRC Af-Pak Testimony

Something came up today I wanted to flag for you.
At one of the meetings today on Raj and USAID, it came up that HRC's remarks about failures in Afghanistan have been heard by
USAID folks in the field and in DC as a hard hit. Apparently remarks she made last week echoed her saying that Afghanistan had
been a "heartbreaking" failure (March) and that after reviewing USAID work "we didn't particularly come away impressed" (last
week) and triggered a lot of emotion at USAID. The statements were part of larger remarks and their meanings tweak by the papers,
but the tweaked bites stuck. USAID folk were asking if she could signal her support and gratitude to the civilians in Afghanistan (and
Pakistan) in whatever remarks she makes around Raj 's confirmation it would go a very long way. I understand she is testifying again
this coming week and wondered if maybe the sentiment could be woven into the testimony since the usaid folk in the room
emphasized the upset about previous remarks. Both bites are below.

Thanks


From 12/3/09:
In hearings before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Clinton said that there has been a 10-month investigation of what USAID
was doing on the ground in Afghanistan, and that "we didn't particularly come away impressed." Many of the 300 civilians there were
on six-month rotations and did not have well-defined missions, and many spent time out of the country, she said. More important,
Clinton added, "most of our civilian aid going into Afghanistan had been contracted out without adequate oversight or accountability."
[Washington Post, 12/3/09]

What she said:
What we have done in the last 10 months is, number one, to investigate very thoroughly what was on the ground in Afghanistan And
we didn't particularly come away impressed. As I said in my testimony, there were a little over 300 civilians. Many of them were on
six-month rotations. You looked at their in-country time, a lot of them spent time out of the country. They did not have well-defined
missions. Most of our civilian aid going into Afghanistan had been contracted out without adequate oversight or accountability. [HRC,

From 3/31/09:
THE HAGUE. Netherlands â€” Billions of dollars spent on humanitarian aid to Afghanistan during the past seven years have led to a
"heartbreaking" failure to produce results, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Monday, promising that the new strategy
President Obama announced last week will turn that around.
"Those of you that have been on the ground in Afghanistan, you've seen with your own eyes that a lot of these aid programs don't
work," Clinton told reporters on her plane en route to a conference here on Afghanistan. "That is one of the reasons why we have
sought a lot of advice on how to improve them." [USA Today, 3/31/09]
