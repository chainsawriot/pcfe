Enjoyed your discussion with Karzai on the hermeneutics of Herman Cain. Try this with the next head of state you
encounter,
his position stated this am on Fox News on abortion that it should be illegal and up to every family to decide. Cheers, Sid

Fox New Interview with Herman Cain, 10/21/11
MacCALLUM: The question is do you believe abortion should be legal in this country for families who want to make that
decision?
CAIN: No, no, no, I do not believe abortion should be legal in this country if that's the question.
MacCALLUM: Then you're saying that if those circumstances come up and the family does make that decision, that they
decide that that is the best thing for this young person, or she decides that on her own if that's what they decided that it
would be an illegal abortion that they would need to seek.
CAIN: It would be an illegal abortion. Look, abortion should not be legal, that is clear, but if that family made a decision to
break the law, that is that family's decision, that's all I'm trying to say.
