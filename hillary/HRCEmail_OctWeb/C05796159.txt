Subject:                           Day


His delegation called Frank Ricciardone late last night to ask if Day should immediately get on a plane to Washington.
Frank and I discussed and he told Day's team to hold for a day while we do consults with other G8 members, which is
our responsibility as host. Day's team was agreeable but he is obviously standing by either to come or to do by VTC.

In other news, I'll be in around 10 because I have a breakfast at Brookings and then, fingers crossed, a final trip to the
dentist.
