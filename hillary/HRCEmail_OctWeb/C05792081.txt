Sure. I had been scheduled to be in Beijing only for the SSD the day before you arrive, and then for the first day of the
S+ED, which includes the SSD report. So departing late May 3 had been plan all along; only question had been whether
to go to Jordan or back to DC for Foreign Affairs Day. Anyway, will do whatever you think best. See you shortly. Bill

In looking at the S&ED schedule, I think it may be difficult for you to leave in the midst of the meetings. Let's discuss
today. Thx.
