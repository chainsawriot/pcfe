Jake

As per our chat this am, I wanted to send you the summary of the discussion between the Exec
Director of GACC and the lead author of the "negative" MIT research study. They are still talking but
have agreed to do a joint op-ed to clarify their views.

Subject: Good call with Esther Dufflo

Sumi and I just completed a one hour, productive call with Esther Dufflo, one of the authors, and arguably best known of
the authors of the MIT study that has generated the Post article and all of the blogs in recent weeks. She was generous
with her time                                                                           and was very constructive in our
discussion.

Key points:

1) She agreed that the press had taken their study "a little too far" and made claims that are,damaging to the sector.
2) She also agreed that the stove used in their study while it appeared to be good at the time is clearly not the cleanest
out there and had several issues around durability.
3) We all agree that more research needs to be done and she is keen on engaging with us on this and asked a lot of
good questions around cleaner stoves that are available today for additional studies.
4) We emphasized our approach on sustained adoption not just initial uptake.
4) She listened quite intently about Igniting Change, our strategic plan, comprehensive approach, long term focus and
the fact that the biggest and first grants out the door from the Alliance quite intentionally have been to support research
and to fill in the evidence gaps. She was curious as to what we have done to get a sense of the markets and stoves in
existence today and we talked about our market assessment studies and the process of stakeholder consultations in
each priority country.

1) She will talk to her co-authors about an op-ed and event. She seemed open to it but wanted to consult with her co
authors. She even seemed happy and willing to come down to DC or NYC to make it happen. She laughed and said
nothing interesting happens in Boston so if we were hoping to get press that might not be the best location!
2) She is interested in learning more about the RFA for child survival that we have open right now. She will have her co-
authors send a letter of intent to Sumi. They seem clearly interested in engaging in further research with us.
3) We are going to send her our Alliance strategic plan, health and climate working group recommendations and a
couple other docs for her reading pleasure.

In summary I think it was as positive a call as we could have expected. So let's give her some time to check in with her
colleagues and hopefully we have a positive path forward.
