Subject: Velvet rather than violent revolution

I sent the article from which this clip is drawn to jake this morning. Essentially argument is that not all revolutions are
violent; some are velvet -- see czech revolution as example where pres. resigned and parliament passed massive
reforms. And czechs had been under more of a dictatorship than egyptians. Wd anyone say that arabs less ready for
democracy than eastern europeans? Given capacity for self-organization they are showing right now in Tahrir Square?
And note reference to your prophetic voice in Doha.

"Secretary Clinton needs to recover her prophetic voice. She can start by getting real about Egypt's 1971 constitution. It
is no venerated text for Egyptians, as the 1787 U.S. constitution is for Americans. Certainly the Mubarak government has
never been particularly fastidious about it, effectively subordinating the constitution to a 30-year state of emergency.
For that matter, the Americans themselves never gave a thought to relying on the constitution of Baathist Iraq to guide
Baghdad's transition once their invasion had vacated Saddam Hussein's office.

Certainly, it would be nice to segue smoothly from one government to the next. But it is hardly realistic to think the
head of the outgoing regime's repressive apparatus, Omar Suleiman, can control the pace. Indeed, his dark threats to
stage a "coup" and to "deal with Egyptian society with police tools" have rendered him radioactive as a reform
facilitator.

If Secretary Clinton and President Obama want a seamless transition from the discredited organs of the old regime,
there are precedents in Eastern Europe. The model is Czechoslovakia's 1989 revolution. When the usual brute force
failed to quell growing demonstrations against Prague's Communist regime, 20-year incumbent president Gustav Husk
resigned. The Communist parliament meekly adopted constitutional amendments providing for free multiparty
elections (held six months later) and then installed Vaclav Havel, a playwright and leader of the Czech democracy
movement, as president -- all within the span of four weeks from the first protests.

Hosni Mubarak is no Husak, and is entitled to his gold watch for honorable service. His faux parliament is filled with
political careerists of malleable loyalties who can read the handwriting on the wall and want to land on their feet; they
simply have to give swift approval to transition measures and a transition president. "

Subject: one more quick thought re women and Egypt

I think it could be important for you to make the point that we need to be hearing from all of Egyptian society, the voices
of women as well as men. There are plenty of women evident among the protesters. Where are their voices? Who is
representing their needs in negotiating with the government or just more generally? This is a real-time opportunity to
insist that women be present and accounted for. AM
