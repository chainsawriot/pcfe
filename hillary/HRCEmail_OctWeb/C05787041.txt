I'm talking to Tom in 2 minutes. Any updates?

Also, did you find out if Kerry's email was accurately describing Karzai's intentions?

Just finished dinner with Karzai, Petraeus and Eikenberry. During my meeting with Karzai one on one prior to dinner he
agreed to end the special Tribunal confrontation with Parliament and also to capitalize the Kabul Bank and fix it. He also
shared some interesting and important insights on Pakistan which I will forward after my meetings in Islamabad. Might
be a good idea for you to log a call with him and just say "how pleased you are that he will move on the Kabul Bank and
end the Special Tribunal" so there's no back sliding! Will summarize Islamabad (and the full dinner) as soon as I can after
the meetings which start tomorrow night.
