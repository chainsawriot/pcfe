Yes, it will surely come up. Merkel is pretty steamed.
She did not/not call in Phil Murphy over this, but he was with her in DC when GM called to break the news. (She did not
take the call).



See you today to discuss.

Will this decision be an issue for us in Germany?

Also, I heard a rumor that Phil Murphy was called in by Merkel over this? Is that true?

See you tomorrow to discuss. Thx.
