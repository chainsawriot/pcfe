Could I see new draft that incorporates recent events like SNC, Ford return, Asad interview?

One more thought and then I'll drop it. I've spoken with a couple of think-tank friends about the
week's Syria developments and one message comes through loud and clear: the SNC meeting was
terrific, but completely overshadowed by the Barbara Walters interview. So: the op-ed can be the
last word and it can redress the news imbalance. Fred
