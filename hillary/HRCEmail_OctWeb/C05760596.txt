In case your daily briefing doesn't include it, Bill Schneider tells me that the CNN poll shows you at 71 percent favorability,
seven points above Obama at 64 (higher than any recent president at this point). You are credited by Americans as the
one above all who represents the US in the world. Obama is now seen as a more political, contentious, partisan figure.
Your rating is much higher among Republicans than his. You've achieved supra-political status, not anti-political or
apolitical (they know who you are), but supra. Furthermore, recent polls show that the Democrats are likely to pick up
three Senate seats in 2010: Bunning, Burr and Spector. Bunning is wildly unpopular, McConnell is trying to force him out,
splitting the Kentucky party. Burr is losing to a Democrat with far lower name ID in a matchup now. And Spector is toast,
losing by 20 some points to right-wing Rep. Pat Toomey in a primary, who in turn is doomed in the general. These two
factors together--your new standing and the likely outcome in 2010--present a unique opening in the short and medium
term TBD. Sid
