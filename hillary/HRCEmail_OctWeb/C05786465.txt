Subject: NATO delays meeting on ending Libya mission (Reuters)

BRUSSELS, Oct 26 (Reuters) - NATO has postponed until Friday a meeting of alliance ambassadors which had
been set for Wednesday and was expected to formalise a decision to end its Libya mission, a NATO official
said.

  "The Libya discussion has been moved to Friday to accommodate the ongoing consultations with the United
Nations and the National Transitional Council," the NATO official said, referring to Libya's interim rulers.

   NATO states took a preliminary decision last Friday to end NATO's mission in Libya on Oct. 31 and the
commander of the operation said on Tuesday that the alliance believed NTC forces would be capable of
handing security threats.

  However, Libyan interim Oil and Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni said on Tuesday he wanted NATO to
maintain its mission for another month.
