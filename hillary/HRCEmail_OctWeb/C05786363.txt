Subject: 60 Minutes Sunday

Madame Secretary, a very quick update. I just received confirmation from 60 Minutes that a piece on Julian Assange will
air Sunday night. He will be the only person featured. We had made a number of suggestions for outside experts and
former diplomats to interview to "balance" the piece. 60 Minutes assures me that they raised a number of questions
and concerns we planted with them during the course of the interview. We will be prepared to respond to the narrative
Assange presents during the program.
