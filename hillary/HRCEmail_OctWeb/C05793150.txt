For email, no, I don't think so - you need to type them out manually like :) for happy, or :-I I if you want to express
anger at my tardiness.

For text messaging, the chart might be there in the lower right, next to where you type the message.

If it's not, I THINK that if you type :) it MIGHT automatically convert it into a symbol. Try it.

I'm very very sorry for keeping you waiting, I know it's your least favorite pastime. ENTIRELY my fault for not playing it
much safer in case the time shifted. After all these years, I know better.
