Subject: Message for S from David Hale

David Hale just called and asked we pass the following updates to S:

      1. David spoke with Kevin Whitaker, who will call the Uruguay FM now to ensure that Montevideo sends
         instructions today to Geneva on the related issue discussed in the S-Abbas call.
      2. David spoke with Molho about the weapons issue, and Molho understood the impact, and said he will try to get
         an answer before the meeting at 8:00pm local time tonight. David noted he was been working this issue with
         Molho for about a week and a half.

I'll send any updates as I receive them.
