Subject: Maathai statement

I was deeply saddened to learn of the death of Wangari Maathai. The world has l'ost a powerful force for peace,
democracy and women's rights.
From early on, Dr. Maathai was a tireless advocate for the environment, for women and for those in the developing
world who are unable to realize their potential. She founded the Green Belt Movement that has planted millions of
trees and helped women throughout Africa improve their lives and the futures of their families and their communities.
She understood the deep connection between local and global problems, and she helped give ordinary citizens a voice.
Her death has left a gaping hole among the ranks of women leaders, but she has left a solid foundation for others to
build upon. I was inspired by her story and proud to call her my friend.
My thoughts and prayers are with her three children, Waweru, Wanjira and Muta, and her granddaughter, Ruth.
