I spoke with Senator Whitehouse's chief counsel (Sam Goodstein) and relayed the good news. Sam was extremely
appreciative of our efforts in making this happen. In fact, he commented about how quickly Secretary Clinton and State
was able to turn this around compared to Dors normal turn-around time for similar requests!

Thanks again to everyone for the outstanding team effort here!

Dave

An update
        that they are OK with the document being shown to Senator Whitehouse and an appropriately cleared staffer
on Monday in the Intell Committee space. L passed on to Dave Turk in H who will inform the Senator's staff.

Details about the logistics of making all this happen will follow on Monday. I will be out Mon and Tues but Jim is aware
of this, as is Ashley's team
