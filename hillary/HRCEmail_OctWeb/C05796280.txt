Noticed you are seeing Canadian FM Baird today. The Canadian Foreign Ministry is into our Intl Diaspora Engagement
Alliance. They actually provided funding to the Caribbean Idea Marketplace that you anncd in Jamaica.


Canada would be a great partner to take this alliance global and we have had discussions with a member of his staff
(Ambassador Arif). If you get the chance, a mention would be helpful.


Thnx


Kris
