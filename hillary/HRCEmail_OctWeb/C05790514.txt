Not too much. You've seen Jeff s readout. He and Bill and I conferred on how to approach Monday - we're working on
points for Lavrov that try to lock in the small gains made today. Getting Kofi pointed in the right direction is an
important task; we'll have to figure out how to do that.

Dan B is working on your remarks for Monday and will send them tomorrow.

Bill T is trying to herd cats on the FMF designation; I checked in with Toria today to get her advice on how to frame it
most effectively for the Egypt working group crowd (Kagan and Diehl and Abrams and those types who will raise hell
with Leahy). Bill will meet with them this week.

Nothing else urgent.
