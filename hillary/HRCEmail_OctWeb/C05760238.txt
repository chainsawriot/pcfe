1     Clarification on next week —
                                                                                           Should I plan for a DC/office day
on Thursday, September 3rd with the last meeting being the Sunday PC?

2.   Monday, September 14th — AIPAC has invited you to address their Minyan Mission meeting that evening at the
Newseum. 100-200 of the top donors that meet every two years, they have a variety of speakers including Hoyer,
Cantor, Berman, etc. Given your possible trip, we'recommend that I go ahead regret — I will not mention travel, just an
unavoidable conflict.
