Subject:



    asked Jeff to send a "personal request" to you - that the USG start dodging discussion of the possibility of civil war in
Syria. He argues that we should continue to stress that violence plays into the hands of the regime, that the protests
remain largely peaceful, etc.

He says we want to avoid appearance that there are two equivalent sides.
