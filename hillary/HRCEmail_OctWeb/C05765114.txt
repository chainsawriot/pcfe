    •     On the issue of allowing more USG civilians into Somalia,




Interagency Meetings

    •     Jack said that two new DCs had been added this week —



    •     Jim added that there will be another PC

Congressional Issues

    •   The SFRC will mark up the Kerry/Lugar Foreign Assistance Bill next Tuesday. We have provided informal
        comments.

    •   Jack's meeting with Senator Lugar, when it takes place, will focus on agriculture. S/SRAP is drafting a letter from
        Jack to Lugar that would help address his concerns in this regard. One of the things we have had to face is a
        myth circulating on the Hill that the 60 agricultural experts sent to Afghanistan by USDA had been new hires and
        that USAID could just as easily have gone out and hired the people. Simply not true. They were on USDA's rolls
        already. It is true, though, that we could have simply detailed them from USDA to USAID, but Jack noted we had
        taken the "whole of government" approach seriously and had instead sent them directly.

    •   Senator Feinstein will go with Senators Kyle and Sessions to Geneva for the START talks next week.
