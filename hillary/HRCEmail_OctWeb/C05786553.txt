Subject: Afghan security forces to take lead in more areas (AP)

KABUL, Afghanistan - (AP) Afghan officials say the country's own security forces could soon start replacing
U.S. and NATO forces in all or parts of 17 of the nation's 34 provinces.
   President Hamid Karzai is to officially announce his second list of transition sites at a conference next week
in Istanbul.
   In July, he announced the first seven areas to begin the so-called transition process from NATO to Afghan
troop security. Representatives from the areas talked to reporters at a meeting Wednesday in Kabul.
   Many governors complained they need more Afghan security forces and equipment in their areas if the
transition to Afghan forces is to be successful.
