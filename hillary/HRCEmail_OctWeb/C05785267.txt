Thx for sending this to me and I'm copying Melanne. You know we've tried to support the UN small arms treaty but have
run into, as usual, fierce NRA and Congressional opposition. But, I believe we have to keep trying. All the best, H

Subject: arming the rebels, women, and small arms

Kavita Ramdas, until recently the head of the Global Fund for Women, said yesterday in my class in Pton that when the
Global Fund sent out its annual survey to all their grantees re most important issue facing women in the world, they got
three standard answers — poverty, access to education, and violence against women — and two first-time answers: 1) the
increasing militarization and danger of their environments due to the flood of small arms; and 2) the issues already
being caused by climate change (desertification, salination, degradation of topsoil, etc.). Sending arms into Libya will
make it a more dangerous place to live and work at the most fundamental level, unless we're only planning to send
rocket launchers. This is exactly the kind of issue where we never make the nexus b/w the demands of statecraft and
women's lives — resulting state of society. AMS
