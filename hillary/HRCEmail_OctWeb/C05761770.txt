Matt,
Warren Buffett's family claims to be the largest private funder of food security and they're planning to grow the current
level of investment. I'm going to introduce you to his grandson (who worked for me on the Transition and now at WH
Office of Social Innovation). Some of the Buffetts going to be in town in a couple weeks and would be great for you and
Mike Lurie to visit with them --- they want to smarten up further on the issue and asked for my help connecting them to
right people here. Think about how their $ could be helpful to the Department's own goals in food security...

Look for email intro,
Alec
