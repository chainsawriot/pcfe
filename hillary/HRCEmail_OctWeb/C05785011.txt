Bravo to you and HC on yesterday's global LGBT announcement. The closest analogue is probably Eleanor Roosevelt's
1948 launch of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This latest step opens a much-needed further chapter. I
don't know if HC would care what I think, but if you get a chance please congratulate her for me. This will be
remembered as one of her greatest initiatives. Yours too, I suspect.

All best,

Larry
