A Second Front in the Climate War
Year after year, the world's nations gather to find ways to reduce carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, with little meaningful
progress. Frustrated by this slow pace, the United States and five other countries announced this week a modest but potentially game-
changing initiative to cut three other pollutants that also contribute significantly to climate change.


The three pollutants — methane, soot (also known as black carbon) and hydrofluorocarbons — together account for about 3o percent to
4o percent of the rise in global temperatures. Unlike carbon dioxide, they do not remain in the atmosphere for a long time, but, while
they are there, they drive temperatures upward.


Mainstream scientists believe that to avoid disastrous increases in the sea levels and widespread drought, the rise in global
temperatures by 2050 should not exceed 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Though cuts in carbon dioxide will also be
necessary to reach that goal, curbing these three pollutants will help enormously.

Officials hope further that by tackling these pollutants they can achieve relatively quick and measurable reductions in emissions without
waiting for politicians to act or the United Nations process to produce a global agreement on carbon dioxide.


The plan's founding members are the United States, Canada, Sweden, Mexico, Ghana and Bangladesh. Washington and Ottawa will
jointly underwrite a $1.5 million start-up fund. Clearly, the program must be scaled up over time, with many more countries
participating. In the short term, officials say their purpose is to educate and test inexpensive and technologically accessible ways of
capturing these gases.


Soot, a huge health hazard, can be reduced by installing filters on diesel engines, replacing traditional cookstoves with more efficient
models and banning the open burning of agricultural waste. Methane can be captured from oil and gas wells, leaky pipelines, municipal
landfills and wastewater treatment plants.


Significantly reducing hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, could be harder. These compounds, widely used in air-conditioners and originally
developed to replace the refrigerants that were damaging the ozone layer, turned out to be a potent greenhouse gas. Efforts to find less-
harmful substitutes have met resistance from countries like India and China, where most HFCs are manufactured.


Governments everywhere should obviously be pushing to reduce carbon dioxide, the most dangerous greenhouse gas. In the meantime,
opening an important second front in the climate war will demonstrate that progress is possible.
