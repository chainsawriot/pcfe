Alec:

Thanks for your note. This is great news, and a very powerful example of what you have been able to
accomplish.

The dramatic content of social media messaging from Syria, and your effort to amplify it, has had a
positive impact here. As the violence and killing have mounted, the traditional arguments used here
in defense of the sovereignty of the government of Syria and to keep Brazil on the sidelines of this
event have eroded. It is worth noting that the recent IBSA mission to Damascus was an example of
how Brazil, India, and South Africa felt they could not work within the BRICS context because of
significant differences with the Chinese and Russian over human rights. Even this mission, however,
will be a source of problems for the countries that participated. The very traditional images of
diplomats seated in conversation with the Syrian President and Foreign Minister were overwhelmed
by the social media images of the violence that continued that same day, with 15 dead. The

promises made by Bashir and his FM in the meeting, and which were repeated in the statement
released by the visiting IBSA delegation, stood in stark contrast to images of tanks firing into crowds.

A disconnect exists here between the traditionalism of the foreign affairs experts, and the emerging
world of social media. The traditionalists still do not understand what they are up against, and have
relied on the relative inertia of most Brazilians regarding foreign affairs. However, this is changing
rapidly, and events in Syria could be what defines a new stage in building popular content into
Brazil's foreign policy.

Regards,
Tom

Tom,
Small thing I thought you would find of interest; you've heard me talk about how we should cultivate "social media
influencers" for the purpose of validation and amplification of our message.

Embassy Brasilia set up a coffee for me and Marcelo Tas during my brief trip to Brazil in April. Very positive visit. This
morning, I pushed out some Syria-related content on Twitter. Tas picked up on it, built in a Portuguese translation, and
then disseminated to his nearly 2 million followers on Twitter. That then ricocheted around Brazilian social media circles
where it was further amplified so that literally millions and millions of people in Brazil (perhaps 10M+) have read the
content we pushed out. More importantly, they don't think of it as something the USG is pushing out, but rather
Marcelo Tas. In translating and disseminating the content himself, he became its publisher and validator.

It's a small thing, but a good thing; an example of how to use "networks" for local amplification and validation.

My best,
Alec
