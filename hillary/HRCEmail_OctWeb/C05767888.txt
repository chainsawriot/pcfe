SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED

G-8 POLITICAL DIRECTORS

    •     Bill reported on his conversations with the Russians on Iran. I understand those have been shared in other
          channels.

HAITI

    •     Pat reported that we have recovered the remains of all the Americans believed to have been in the Hotel
          Montana. The issue now is under what authority and who would pay for the recovery effort to continue for the
          other 10-12 other sets of remains still entombed, something the embassy would like to happen. Cheryl asked
          Pat for options.

    •     There is still uncertainty as to when the Haiti Supplemental will go to the Hill. Perhaps not until the Donors
          Conference. Cheryl stressed the need to have pre-cleared language on what we can say to the Hill and at the
          Conference with respect to numbers.




NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY

    •




PUBLIC AFFAIRS

    •     The issue of whether the U.S. offered to "mediate" in the Falklands issue is still attracting much press in
          Europe. We have made clear that the Secretary said we were "willing to help," but had not mentioned an offer
          to mediate.

    •     Gration will provide an update press briefing tomorrow.

   •    We will also give a preview on the Iraqi elections tomorrow.


   •    New York Times story today on allegations State sought to block serious investigation of 2007 Blackwater
        shooting event. PJ had pushed back. Pat noted that one Blackwater official who is quoted undercuts the whole
        allegation, suggesting that in fact State officials did not give Blackwater time to get their story together, but
        immediately launched an investigation.

CONGRESSIONAL RELATIONS

   •    Senators McCain and Lieberman have voiced concerns that Robert Ford may leave Baghdad early to begin
        preparations for his next assignment as COM in Damascus. They believe he needs to remain in Baghdad at least
        through the formation of a new government, although that could take months.


   •    The Pakistan spend plan had a mixed reception on the Hill.


   •    Senators Dodd and Menendez will be on the CODEL to Haiti this Friday.

   •    We are working to help Preval set up meetings on the Hill during his visit next week.

   •    Rose Gottemoeller is in town and will brief Kerry, Lugar and Levin on START.


   •    The Secretary will testify with Secretary Gates before the Full Senate Appropriations Committee on March 24 on
         the war supplemental.

   •     Senator Kyle released his holds on Laura Kennedy and Eileen Donahoe

LEGAL ISSUES

   •



   •     There is an interagency offsite to discuss preparations for the Review Conference on the International Criminal
         Court Conference in Uganda in May and June.
