Subject: Tunisia issues final election results (AP)


TUNIS (AP) - Tunisia's election commission has issued the final results of the Oct. 23 national election,
confirming the dominant position of the Islamist Ennanda Party.
   The once banned movement has taken 89 out of 217 seats in the newly elected assembly, which will write the
fledgling democracy's new constitution and appoint an interim government ahead of new elections in the next
year or so.
   The Oct. 23 election was held nine months after Tunisians overthrew President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who
had ruled with an iron fist for 23 years.
   The Tunisian uprising inspired similar pro-democracy movements elsewhere around the region, setting off
what has been called the Arab Spring in the Middle East.
   Ennanda has pledged to preserve Tunisia's progressive legislation on women's rights.
