Subject: ICRC says still no Syria aid convoy access to Baba Amro (Reuters)



GENEVA (Reuters) - The     International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said March 3 it was still
negotiating with Syrian authorities who have denied its aid convoy access to the shattered Baba Amro district of
Horns.

    An ICRC convoy of seven trucks carrying food and other relief supplies, joined by Red Crescent ambulances
to evacuate the sick and wounded, has been stalled in Horns since arriving there on Friday.

   "The ICRC and Syrian Red Crescent are not yet in Baba Amro today (Saturday). We are still in negotiations
with authorities in order to enter Baba Amro. It is important that we enter today," ICRC spokesman Hicham
Hassan told Reuters in Geneva.
