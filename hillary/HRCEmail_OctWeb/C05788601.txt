Jake,

I hope you are doing well. I wanted to let you know that I'm planning to visit Afghanistan next week (leaving Sunday) to
engage with the government, religious leaders, and press on the Quran incident. We're hoping that I can build on my
previous visits and that my background in Quranic memorization can help in our efforts there/demonstrate respect for
the Quran and Islam. I'll forward to you separately a message I sent to Ben and to Kabul that might serve as a plan for
measures we can take to engage/rebuild trust.

I know that this issue continues to have widespread ramifications so I wanted to make sure you (and the Secretary of
course) knew about my trip. I've sent a note to Ambassador Grossman as well and SCA is helping coordinate with
Embassy Kabul.

Thanks,
Rashad
