STATEMENT BY SECRETARY HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON

Holding Iranian Human Rights Abusers Accountable

In June 2009, the world watched as Iran's security forces violently suppressed thousands of Iranians who were calling for
transparency and accountability in their government. Nearly two years after Iran's brave citizens took to the streets, the
struggle for civil liberties and fundamental rights continues. Today, the United States has sanctioned three Iranian
government entities complicit in the ongoing brutal repression — the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the Basij
Resistance Force, and Iran's Law Enforcement Forces (LEF) — as well as LEF Commander Ismail Ahmadi Moghadam.

While Iran's leaders hypocritically applaud protesters abroad calling for self-determination, many of Iran's own citizens -

The United States stands with all Iranians who wish for a government that respects their human rights, their dignity and
their freedom, and we call on the Iranian government to end its systematic human rights abuses and political hypocrisy.
Today's sanctions reflect our commitment to hold accountable those governments and officials that violate human
rights and deprive their citizens of the opportunities and future they deserve.
