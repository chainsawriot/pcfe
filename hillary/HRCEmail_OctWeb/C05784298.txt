BENGHAZI, Libya, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Libya declared the liberation of the nation on Sunday after 42 years of
one-man rule by Muammar Gaddafi came to an end with his capture and death last week, setting the North
African state on course for a transition towards democracy.

   "We declare to the whole world that we have liberated our beloved country, with its cities, villages, hill-tops,
mountains, deserts and skies," said an official who opened the ceremony in Benghazi, the place where the
uprising erupted in February and which has been the headquarters for the National Transitional Council.
