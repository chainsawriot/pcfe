MANILA (Reuters) - A Philippine lower court on Friday issued an arrest warrant for former president Gloria
Macapagal Arroyo on charges of electoral fraud, a clerk of court said.

   "After finding the existence of probable cause, the court issued a warrant of arrest against the accused," the
clerk told reporters.

   A person charged with electoral fraud is not allowed bail. Arroyo had been planning to fly to Singapore later
on Friday after the Supreme Court rejected the government's motion to allow its travel ban against her.
