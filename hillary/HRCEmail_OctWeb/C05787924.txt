Yes — it is a social networking site where you create a profile and post an online version of your resume. Former and
current colleagues and employers have the opportunity to write positive things about your work, all in the hope that it
can be used to find a future job. The network you create is with friends, but your profile is available to the public.

Subject: Re: Invitation to connect on Linkedln

my understanding is that its a networking website where you list details about yourself like your name, location,
field of work and education in order to connect with potential employers (or if youre an employer, to find
potential candidates).
