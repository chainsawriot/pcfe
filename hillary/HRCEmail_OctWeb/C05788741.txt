Not really, actually. Pretty quiet day.

Dan Feldman called about the floods in Pakistan. Nides and I told him fine to redirect funds but quietly so as not to
create awkwardness with flooding here.

Been working the Libya event - it will proceed as you suggested.

Will forward latest report from Derek Mitchell on his Burma visit.

Will also forward note from Denis on MEPP.
