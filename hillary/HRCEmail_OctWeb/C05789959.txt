Cheryl, Pat

I wanted to let you know that at today's business meeting, all of our 14 nominees on the agenda were voted out
of committee by voice vote. We continue to work with Reid and McConnell staff to press for all our nominees
(including those reported out today) to be confirmed before the Senate adjourns at the end of the week. Rumors
continue that there may be a package of Administration nominees approved this week but there is still no clarity
on how big a package it will be. Those nominees approved by SFRC today include:

Julissa Reynoso (Uruguay)
Gina Abercrombie-Winstanley (Malta)
Rick Barton (CSO)
Bill Todd (Cambodia)
Pam White (Haiti)
Linda Thomas Greenfield (DG)
Carlos Pascual (ENR)
Chris Stevens (Libya)
Jake Walles (Tunisia)
Tracey Jacobson (Kosovo)
Mark Pekala (Latvia)
Richard Norland (Georgia)
Ken Merten (Croatia)
Jeff Levine (Estonia)


Thanks,
Dave
