Subject                            African farmland



Could you include info in the briefing for my trip about what's happening in Africa in general and in the three countries
I'm visiting in particular about the sale and leasing of farmland to foreign interests (China, Qatar, etc)?

Does the WTO prevent/limit any aspect of the sale of products by foreign interests outside the countries of production?
