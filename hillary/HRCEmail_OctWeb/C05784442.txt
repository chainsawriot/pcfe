Subject: AP Interview: Pakistan PM sees progress in US ties (AP)

LAHORE, Pakistan - (AP) Pakistan's prime minister says his country wants to rebuild ties with the United
States despite Islamabad's ongoing retaliation for deadly airstrikes on its troops by the U.S.-led coalition in
Afghanistan.
  Prime Minister Yousuf Ram Gilani told The Associated Press on Monday that he believes a new relationship
with Washington, one that is more acceptable to Islamabad, was "doable" and "won't take long" to achieve.
  Gilani also says Islamabad remains committed to bringing Afghan insurgent leaders into peace talks with
Kabul.
  That may reassure international leaders meeting in Germany to discuss the future of Afghanistan.
  Pakistan boycotted the talks because of the Nov. 26 airstrikes along the Pakistan-Afghan border that killed 24
Pakistani troops.
