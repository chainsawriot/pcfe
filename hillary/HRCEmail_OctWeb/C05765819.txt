                              livriting the argument on 2011 is this: "The absence of a timeframe for transition would deny us
any sense of urgency in working with the Afghan government. It must be clear that Afghans will have to take responsibility
for their security, and that America has no interest in fighting an endless war."

You will have to stress among other things:

That summer 2011 is the start of a transition, the pace and nature of which will be driven by conditions on the ground.

That our resolve is reflected in a tripling of troops since Obama took office, and a significant civilian commitment that will
continue after our combat forces leave.

That we aren't just going to let the Taliban sit around and wait -- we are surging in Afghanistan to take the fight to them
and redoubling our efforts with the Pakistanis to squeeze the other side of the border.

That July 2011 is enough time for our training effort to start bearing real fruit, for our troops to make serious progress in
creating space for the Afghan government, and for our civilian efforts to have meaningful impact in Kabul and in the field.

Subject: Instant Read-Out and Additional Possible Questions for Tomorrow

Rich,

Here's a little instant read-out as well as some thoughts on other possible questions and dynamics for
tomorrow's hearings:

Rs have been generally supportive of the 30,000 additional troops although some are carping that Obama only
gave McChrystal 3/4 of what he asked for. Rs are all over Obama for the July 2011 timeline. Here are some
quotes:
   • McCain: "Dates for withdrawal are dictated by conditions. The way that you win wars is to break the
        enemy's will, not to announce dates that you are leaving." I have "grave concerns about this date of
        withdrawal." Paraphrasing, there's an inconsistency about saying conditions on the ground versus a date
        certain. I'll ask at the hearings about that. "We should have a goal of being out day after tomorrow — a
        goal. But it's dictated by conditions on the ground." [We should really parse through McCain's
        statements very closely; I caught him on a number of networks and he could go either way on us. He
        was saying very positive things in rebuffing Sean Hannity's bait that McChrystal only got 3/4 of what he

       asked for. Pretty clear that the more Gates and others are comfortable saying "conditions on the ground"
       will dictate, the more McCain be on board.]
   •   Graham: "I support the President's decision to send 30,000 more troops.. .but I'm concerned about the
       July 2011 timeframe. What does this mean? What message will it send to our allies and adversaries in
       Afghanistan and Pakistan? We're not likely going to be able to withdraw many forces by that time."
Accordingly, we can expect a ton of questions tomorrow about what the July 2011 date means, which will
be squarely in the lanes of Gates and Mullen, but I can't imagine S. won't have to weigh in at least
somewhat.




Probably not as much on SASC, but a lot of Ds (especially in afternoon HFAC hearing), will go hard at the
troop surge and the $ issue. Feingold had this to say: "As far as I'm concerned, everything would be on the
table, in terms of trying to prevent this error from occurring ... Action can include, obviously, not permitting
funding for additional troops. It can include resolutions for time frames to withdraw troops, as many of us have
worked on together with regard to Iraq, and other approaches that we'd be open to."

Many of the news stories are focused on the bud et issue —     ., how is Obama .toin to sa for this?




Not surprisingly, Levin will support securing the cash and the time-lime: "We couldn't get a timeline out of
[President George W.] Bush, we [did] get a timeline out of Obama."
