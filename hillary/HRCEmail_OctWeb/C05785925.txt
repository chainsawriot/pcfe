I am told that SRSG Choi's COS spoke to the Bishop a couple of hours ago. The Bishop indicated that the situation has
now "calmed down" and that they prefer to stay where they are. Choi is in regular contact with Amb. Phil Carter on this
and other cases.

Subject: Bishop Benjamin Boru

Burns,
The United Methodist bishop in Ivory Coast, Benjamin Boni, and his family are trapped in his
residence in Abidjan five minutes from the presidential palace in the midst of the heaviest
fighting. He has sent word for help.

The bishop may be in the church's radio station, Voice of Hope. The radio station (La Voix de
L'Esperance, FM 101.6) is on the same grounds as the bishop's residence and the church. The
address is: Cocody, Cour du Temple Jubile', 01 BP 1282 Abidjan 01.

Peace,
Jim
