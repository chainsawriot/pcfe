Apparently you really kicked *ss at the Saban Forum. I've heard from a number of people. Ignatius' take below.

Your boss hit it out of the park today at Saban Forum. Never seen her rock a room quite like that. The 27th is great. I will
put you down for that and be in touch about arrangements. Let's talk when you are back from your next travels.

Look forward to catching up. We're off again tomorrow to Bonn and Brussels and elsewhere -- Afghanistan, NATO,
OSCE, you name it. I'd be happy to do Feb 27.

In Burma right now and can't seem to hold a cell phone connection for more than 2 mins. Sorry to miss you today but
would love to talk about
coming up to Harvard to speak at your class. Nay Pyi Taw is a strange
place...

Jake:
                Any chance we could talk today. Partly for a column, and I also want to ask you to speak to my class at
Harvard next term.
