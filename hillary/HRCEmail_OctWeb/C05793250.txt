Thanks, Joanne. That sounds great. We would likely bring 5-6 of our leadership including Andrew Tisch, Chairman and
CEO of Loews Corporation, Sherrie Westin, Executive Vice President of Sesame Workshop, Bill Lane, Washington
Director of Caterpillar and Ann Lewis.

We would like to speak to Ms. Mills about Secretary Clinton's legacy and discuss how we can be helpful in supporting
and continuing the incredible work she has done during her tenure at the State Department.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Many thanks,
Beth

Beth,

Apologies for the delay. I've blocked off 30 minutes at 10:30am on Wednesday, but have not confirmed with Cheryl Who
would attend this meeting and is there a specific agenda they want to cover?

Hi Joanne,

I hope you had a nice weekend. I wanted to follow up on our conversation last week to see if Ms. Mills may be available
on Wednesday to meet with a small group of U.S. Global Leadership Coalition leadership who will be in town for our
board meeting?
