Jeff - want to mention that yousef called the other day to talk about ABZ visit. They want to do something less formal.
Suggested a lunch or a dinner instead of a formal mtg in ofc. Of course yousef offered to host dinner at his place which I
said wouldn't work for her. Then said they could go to a restaurant too. We can discuss details. Hrc seems open to it.
Also, they want it small, he said ideally you, jake and me. It will just be yousef and mohammed from their side. We can
discuss further.
