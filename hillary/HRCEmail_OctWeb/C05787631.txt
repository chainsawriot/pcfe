Subject: If Ellen DeGeneres in LA

I spoke with her manager today. OGAC is seeking to have her help promote your HIV/AIDS speech in two weeks as well
as World Aids' Day.


Should you see her and end up in conversation, it would be ideal for you to share the following points:




                      Talking Points for Secretary Clinton: Hollywood Bowl Party
                                          and Ellen DeGeneres

Background: I spoke with Ellen DeGeneres' manager, David McGuire, today about Ellen
serving as a Special Envoy for Global HIV/AID Awareness. OGAC is developing a concept paper
for consideration, but David agreed that there will be some sort of arrangement for Ellen to
promote both your speech and World AIDS Day through social media or perhaps you phoning
into her show at some point.

    • I'm very excited about the possibility of your using your incredible platform to help us
      raise awareness about eliminating HIV/AIDS.
    • I'm giving a speech in two weeks where I'm going to call upon the world to join the U.S.
      in creating an AIDS Free Generation.
    • Thanks to the science, we are truly on the cusp of making this happen. And if you could
      help us raise awareness about this historic opportunity, it would be terrific.
