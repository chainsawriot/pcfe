Statement of the OAS Secretary General on the Summit of the Americas

The Secretary General of the Organization of American States (OAS), Jose Miguel Insulza, today recalled
that in April 2009, "at the conclusion of the Fifth Summit of the Americas, its Chair, the Prime Minister of
Trinidad and Tobago, Patrick Manning, remarked upon the existence of a clear consensus that the
reintegration of Cuba in the inter-American relations is an essential step toward the building of a more
cohesive and integrated Americas."

Insulza added that "in fulfillment of that consensus, the 39th OAS General Assembly in San Pedro Sula
annulled the Resolution through which the Government of Cuba was excluded from participating in the
inter-American system." The Resolution of the 39 GA/OAS established that: "the participation of the
Republic of Cuba in the OAS will be the result of a process of dialogue initiated at the request of the
Government of Cuba, and in accordance with the practices, purposes, and principles of the OAS."

Secretary General Insulza noted that "that request has not been made."
