Subject: Yemen swears in national unity government (AP)


SANAA (AP) - A national unity government has been sworn into office in Yemen after months of political
turmoil between the opposition and longtime President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
   The new government is part of a power transfer deal signed last month by Saleh and the opposition that
allows him to step down after 33 years in power in exchange for immunity from prosecution.
   It is made up of a nearly equal number of opposition and loyalist ministers, among them nine who served in
the previous Cabinet.
   The defense, foreign affairs and oil ministries remain in the hands of Saleh's loyalists.
   However, the opposition is now in control of the finance, information and interior ministries.
