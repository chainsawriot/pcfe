January 22, 2010




President Barack Obama
The White House


1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20500



Dear Mr. President:

I write today to urge you to ensure that women play a key role in the international conference on Afghanistan
that will be held in London on January 28, 2010. As I understand, a key objective of the conference is to help
formulate a strategy to stabilize Afghanistan and ultimately reduce the country's reliance on outside assistance.
However, I am deeply concerned that women are not being viewed as an essential element in reaching that goal.

Just yesterday, the Department of State released its "Afghanistan and Pakistan Regional Stabilization Strategy,"
a detailed, thirty-page document that highlights everything from the importance of rehabilitating watersheds to
expanding mobile banking systems. The document only makes one small reference to Afghan women. Most
disturbing, it contains an entire section largely dedicated to reintegrating the Taliban, who are infamous for the
atrocities they have committed against women. This section does not mention women at all.

This is particularly alarming, because the future of Afghanistan is inextricably linked to the empowerment of
Afghan women and girls. As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton recently said, "Investing in the potential of

women to lift and lead their societies is one of the best investments we can make." It has been proven that
women are inclined to use their successes to invest in their communities, to start small businesses, and to send
their children to school. Giving women the tools to succeed is critical to Afghanistan's chance at a brighter and
more secure future.

As such, I urge you to ensure that the role of women in the future of Afghanistan is a key focus during the
London conference. I also ask that you help make certain that the voices of Afghan women are heard. It is my
understanding that the Department of State has expressed support for having an Afghan woman address the
foreign ministers at the conference and I urge you to help make this a reality.

Thank you for your prompt consideration of this important request.




Sincerely,




Barbara Boxer

United States Senator

Cheryl,

     We have no record of having received the letter and have not been able to find a copy, but I understand
that Miguel Rodriguez in H is trying to run it down through Ann Norris on Senator Boxer's staff. Dan

Barbara Boxer apparently sent a letter to saying there is nothing about women in the Afghan strategy. There
is nothing in the table of contents.

Is this accurate? Seems odd given that I know that AMS had flagged this and I bilJake you had.

Can you advise.
