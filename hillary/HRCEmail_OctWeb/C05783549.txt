Subject: Officials say Ramos has been rescued (AP)

   CARACAS (AP) _ Venezuelan authorities say police have rescued Washington Nationals catcher Wilson
Ramos and that he is "safe and sound," two days after he was kidnapped.
   The justice minister said on state television that Ramos was rescued by police. He added the circumstances
weren't immediately clear.
   Armed men seized Ramos at gunpoint Wednesday outside his home in a working-class neighborhood in the
city of Valencia. Authorities said Thursday that they had found a stolen SUV used by the kidnappers abandoned
in a nearby town.
   The abduction was the first known kidnapping of a major league baseball player in a country that has dozens
of players on big league rosters in the U.S.
