Colleagues -

Made the call. Gov. Rendell was in transmit mode. He wants us to leave 1000 Marines at Camp Ashraf to prevent a
massacre. Otherwise, he will offer to go there himself to protect the denizens of Camp Ashraf. The Governor added
that he and Gov. Ridge would share these thoughts at the National Press Club this Thursday (we're checking this with
the NPC). I was able only to (a) explain my role and (b) state that preventing a humanitarian catastrophe was the top
priority.

DF

DAS Barbara Leaf and Iraq Director John Desrocher have been spoken to him recently and repeatedly. So, Dan, you
could mention that you are following up and taking over from them. He will be happy to hear from a new voice, for he
has not been satisfied with the level of responsiveness he believes he should have, but didn't, get from Barbara and
John.

Jeff

Can you check to see if you have any calls from Ed Rendell re MEK?

If rich, Dan - can you reach out to him to identify your role and indicate we wanted you to solicit his thoughts.

[He has indicated he is awaiting a call back from the dept - he also is very passionate about this issue and avoiding any
confrontation b/w the authorities and camp residents]
