Hi Cheryl, ,

Here are some pertinent points regarding the selection of the Executive Director of the World Food Program:

•         Josette Sheeran is the third consecutive American to hold the position since 1992; the first —
Catherine Bertini held the position for two consecutive five-year terms 1992-2002; Sheeran's predecessor
James Morris withdrew himself from consideration for a second term to make way for Sheeran 's candidacy.

•          UN Secretary General Ban and FAO Director General Diouf (in office through 12/31/11) will jointly
select the next Executive Director in consultation with the 36-member WFP Executive Board. Following past
patterns, Ban will likely solicit nominations by mid-September 2011 for the April 2012 appointment.

•          The appropriate nominator of the official U.S. candidate would be the Secretary, who would send a
letter along with the nominee's resume to Ban. We would normally follow that with an announcement of our
nomination, and diplomatic outreach to the WFP's Executive Board members and key UN officials in the
Secretariat.

•        There is precedent for private citizens to pursue candidacies — in 2006, US NGO official Tony
Banbury put himself forward as a candidate against Sheeran.

 •        It is also likely there will be interest from the Europeans and Canadians in putting forward
 nominees, as in 2006.

 •           After the close date for nominations, a joint UNSYG/FAO search committee will determine finalists
 for interviews sometime in the fall of 2011; selection would likely be made before the end of that year.

 •         Once we select our official nominee, even before submitting the name, it would be good to ramp
 up the person's exposure in UN and other international fora. E.g. Before nominating her, the Bush
 administration arranged for Sheeran's appointment to the "High-Level UN Panel on Systems Coherence" on
 development, humanitarian assistance, and the environment. Such an appointment would provide a platform

for the nominee's acquaintance with officials and opinion leaders on WFP issues (although this is not really an
issue for the two you mentioned). It would also be good to begin including the planned nominee in all the
Secretary's and other senior USG officials' participation in food-related meetings and other events.




Please let me know if you need more.
