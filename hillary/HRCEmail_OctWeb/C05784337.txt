Subject: Chinese leader urges North Korea to better US ties (AP)

BEIJING - (AP) A Chinese leader is urging ally North Korea to improve its strained ties with the United
States as U.S. and North Korean diplomats prepare to talk about restarting nuclear disarmament negotiations.
   A report early Monday from China's official Xinhua News Agency says Chinese Vice Premier Li Keqiang
told North Korean Premier Choe Yong Rim that improving ties with the U.S. and South Korea would promote
stability in the region.
   Made at the start of a three-day visit to North Korea, Li's plea comes as U.S. and North Korean diplomats
gather in Geneva to see about resuming six-nation talks on North Korea's nuclear program. North Korea walked
out on the talks but now wants to re-engage.
   Li says China supports restarting the talks quickly.
