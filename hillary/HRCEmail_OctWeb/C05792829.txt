I'm leaving for China tom'w morning and when you go to Bangladesh, I go to Burma. Mozena talks to          regularly       B1
and has a pretty good grasp of the situation.                                                                              1.4(D)

I have to leave for China a day earlier than your takeoff. We are doing our dialogue on philanthropy to nudge Chinese on
what they should be doing. Susie Buell is on our delegation and will be speaking on how individuals make a difference.
Wonder how Chen situation will impact.

The Wilson dinner was a lovefest. All the republicans tell me.how much they admire you!
