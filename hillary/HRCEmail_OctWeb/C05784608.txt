Subject: Iran FM joins Saudi mourning amid plot tensions (AP)


TEHRAN, Iran - (AP) Iran is sending its foreign minister to mourn the Saudi crown prince in a possible
effort to ease tensions amid allegations that Iranian agents plotted to kill the kingdom's ambassador in
Washington.
   Iranian state TV says Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi will be among the dignitaries arriving Tuesday in the
Saudi capital Riyadh to pay respects to the late Crown Prince Sultan, who died in New York on Saturday.
   It will be Iran's highest-level contact with Saudi officials since U.S. authorities alleged earlier this month that
a branch of Iran's Revolutionary Guard was linked to the foiled assassination plot.
   Iran has dismissed the accusations as baseless. One of the suspects, an Iranian-American man who lived in
Texas, pleaded not guilty Monday in New York.
