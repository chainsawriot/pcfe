  This holiday season, as people all over the world gather to celebrate in the spirit of
  giving, Feed the Future is taking stock of accomplishments that have advanced food
  security through the support of nine U.S. Government agencies and the commitment of
  twenty country partners. Since 2009, President Obama's Feed the Future initiative
  has:
  •   Helped launch the 1,000 Days partnership to support investment in nutrition from
      pregnancy through a child's second birthday, when adequate nutrition has the
      greatest impact on developing a child's cognitive and physical capacity;
  •   Established the U.S. as one of the five inaugural donors of the Global Agriculture
      and Food Security Program, an innovative multi-donor trust fund that has
      awarded $481 million to twelve low-incothe countries, including eight Feed the
      Future focus countries;
  •   Invested in the Borlaug 21st Century Leadership Program to strengthen the
      human and institutional capital needed to promote agricultural sector innovation
      in partner countries;
  •   Launched the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index, a research method to
      effectively measure the quantity and quality of gender-related programs.
  To learn more about these and other exciting updates on the U.S. Government's global
  hunger and food security initiative, please visit Feed the Future's News & Events page
