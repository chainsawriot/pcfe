I am always happy to discuss organizational and personnel matters, we can do that in person rather than on email.

This is an opportunity for career growth and development for   - something I know you support. We should embrace
and reward that, even when it means we have to make new adjustments. This is       rotation time and while I am sure if
asked he would stay, he would miss the chance to manage the security at the                                   we
have -

I hope it would not surprise you to know that I specifically directed that                       with you given your role, I
indicated it was less critical with Jake. If that did not occur, I will ask   to correct that.

I conveyed the same when I met w/          (that he needed to meet w/ you, and catch Jake if he could).

So happy to discuss how we ensure a seamless transition next June - I think when you meet w/      it will go part of the
way to doing that; I think the rest of the way occurs when he shadows     for a month and you and       train him.

               'ust filled me in on your conversations. I would have appreciated a chance to discuss this before it was
finalized. He has been a HUGE asset protecting our interests and balancing usss politics. He has gone above and beyond
in every way and anyone more stringent will make our life and travel more complicated. Starting from scratch with
someone else is going to be challenging.
