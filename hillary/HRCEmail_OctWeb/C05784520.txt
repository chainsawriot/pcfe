+ Cheryl.

All—

Just got a call from Barbara Walters, who called to tell me that she has been invited to Syria to interview President
Assad.

Tentative dates have her departing Nov 9 and conducting the interview on Nov 13. She called for two specific
things: first, our assessment of whether it's safe for her to travel there; and second, she'd like someone to brief her fully
on current political situation.

Pat — would you or someone you designate like to do the security piece and Liz perhaps you could do the political
laydown?

Let me know how you'd like to proceed.

Thanks!

Mark
