       Jake,

       This is from an Afghan woman recent graduate of Wellesley, who works for me at CIC/NYU.
       Madeleine Albright said Hillary Clinton should see it, so I am sending it along.

       Hi Barney,



       I am sharing with you a short speech I delivered last night. Madeleine Albright spoke too. There
       were 300+ supporters and funders of Seeds of Peace including several Ambassadors at the
       event.



       Dr. Albright had a warm response to my talk and said what I said about negotiations with the
       Taliban is very important. That on women's rights, I should connect with Hillary Clinton.



       Best,

       Parnian
