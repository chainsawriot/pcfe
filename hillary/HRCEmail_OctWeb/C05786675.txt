Subject: thanks and goodbye!

I will never forget January 16, 2009. It was cold, snowy, and I was homeless. Having left New York in the night, I reported
to the State Department at 8AM, to join Ambassador Holbrooke and the creation of SRAP.

Before I knew it, trips with General Allen, Admiral Mullen, Secretary Clinton, Ambassador Holbrooke, and Raj Shah led to
unexpected discovery, headache and heartbreak, creative policy proposals, carrots and sticks, progress and
setbacks. New initiatives galvanized the omnivorous SRAP coalition across the USG and pushed policy beyond
paper. The Strategic Dialogue, Trilateral Summits, Transit Trade, a real Civilian Surge, new efforts at Reconciliation, the
International Contact Group, endless "shuras," and nonstop Shuttle Diplomacy were alive and in motion.

To the team Ambassador Holbrooke assembled whose energy and creativity inspired me daily; to Vikram, Barney, Vali,
Mary Beth, Dereck, Rina, JD, Sean, Jarrett, Greta, Ronan, Rosemarie, Burt, Frank, Alex, Shamilla, Phil, Clemens, Jane,
Joanne, Maureen, Ariella, Andrew, Frank A, Matt, Paul, Rami, Dan, Quintin, Beth, Clare, Sepideh, Otto and my
interagency and comms colleagues Sajit, Jessica, Nayyera, Joe, Larry, Caitlin, and Brian and so many others; to our
tireless staff assistants, especially Morgan, John, Kim, and Chris; to Donna, Esther and Pat for their unstinting support; to
Jake and Derek for wise advice and loyal friendship; to Matt and Ben our pillars at the White House; to Secretary Clinton
and the Obama Administration, who gave me the chance to serve my country and the two countries I cared about most:
every day was an honor.

More than two and a half years have flown by, and I've decided to move on to a new adventure with Virgin Unite, the
non-profit arm of Richard Branson's Virgin Group. I'll be back in New York. I'm excited.

A thousand thanks to you all for these years and to all of you carrying on in government for Afghanistan and Pakistan
and for our own national good. I look forward to meeting and collaborating with many of you in my new capacity.

Love, Ashley
