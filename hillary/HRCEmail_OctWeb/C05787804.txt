Subject: Fw: Our dinner conversation in Sidi Bou Said,Tunisia

I thought you'd like this -- from the head of our women's business hub and the first woman president of the Tunisian
Chamber of Commerce. I hope her optimism is well grounded.

Dear Mrs     Veveer,

I still remember our conversation during our dinner in Sidi Bousaid, in Tunisian, few months following
the Jasmine Revolution. Do you remember my optimism about what Tunisia's future.

Let me assure you that I am still confident and optimist about our future. My feeling was reinforced yesterday,
our election day, when we had a record high turnover, by international standards, between 70 and 80%
participants. What's even more comforting, is the civism of the Tunisians spending hours in line to cast their
votes. People of all ages, fresh 18 year old and those past 90.Thank God old/handicapped people had the
priority and didn't have to line. Believe me some of the voters had joy tears in their eyes; I myself was moved to
tears. This is Tunisia I believe in and I love. I am proud to bring up my daughters in such a country.

The official results won't be out before tomorrow, but preliminary ballot counting indicates that Ennandha, the
islamist party, is top on many lists.
 Fair enough, this is democracy, we accept whoever wins. But no fear, Tunisian women are not in danger, no
one would dare touch our modernist Personal Status Code, that dates back to 1956 and Tunisian economy is not
in danger, either as we have sound economic policies in progress as well as good development plans more fair
to the youngs and the regions.

I am so excited, that's why I wanted to share my feelings with you.
I am planning to be in Washington on November 15th to attend the Tunisia Investment Conference (as detailed
in attachment). I received the invitation form Aspen Institute in my quality of Chair of the PNB- NAPEO
Tunisia Board.
I hope we can meet again to further brainstorm what Tunisia.
