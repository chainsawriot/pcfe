Dear Secretary Clinton,

Just a brief note to you and Melanne to thank you for inviting me to be a part of APEC. Your speech was truly
riveting and I do think an inflection in point for women world wide. I believe we will look back and say that
was the moment when everyone began to understand not just the human rights argument, but the economic
argument. So proud to have been a part of it.
Also, thank you for doing the Q&A with us this week for Newsweek. Much of this week's issue is devoted to
the progress women are (and are not) making, including a fantastic interview with President Dilma Rouseff.
We have sent one to your office and hope you enjoy!

Best,
Tina
