Background: You last spoke with Nafie on June 17 in follow up to your June 13 meeting in Addis Ababa Ethiopia. The
last round of calls was focused on reaching agreement on the text on arrangements for Abyei, which has now been
achieved. The draft resolution for an Ethiopian peacekeeping force is currently with the UN Security Council for 1.4(B)
approval.                                                                                                        1.4(D)
                                                                                                                 B1
You also expressed concern about a lack of a cessation of hostilities in Southern Kordofan, which have been ongoing
since June 5. On June 22, Nafie returned to Addis Ababa for talks with SPLM-North leader Malik Agar focused on
achieving a cessation of hostilities in Southern Kordofan.




                                                                                The latest UN reporting estimates more
than 73,000 people have been displaced since the conflict began. The humanitarian/NGO community continues to
report a lack of access to the internally displaced and deliberate obstruction of vital routes required for resupply.
