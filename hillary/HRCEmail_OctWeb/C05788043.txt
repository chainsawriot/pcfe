Subject: NGO worker cases sent to Egypt court in funding row (Reuters)

  CAIRO (Reuters) - The cases of 40 people embroiled in a dispute over the activities of U.S.-funded pro-
' democracy groups and other organisations have been transferred to the Cairo criminal court, a judicial source
  said on Sunday.

    "The cases of 40 foreign and Egyptian suspects have been transferred to the Cairo criminal court related to
 foreign funding," the judicial source told Reuters.

    He did not give details of the foreigners' nationalities but several U.S. citizens are involved in the case of
 non-governmental organisations and face travel bans.

       The state news agency carried a similar report.
