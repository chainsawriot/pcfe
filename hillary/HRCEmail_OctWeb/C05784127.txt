Subject: World Bank approves $255 million plan for Haiti (AP)


 PORT-AU-PRINCE (AP) - The World Bank has set aside $255 million for helping house Haitians, clean up
neighborhoods and send thousands of children to school over the next year.
   The money Will go toward housing 22,500 people, many of whom have been living in tent camps that sprang
up after the January 2010 earthquake. It will also help spruce up parks and repair roads in neighborhoods that
are home for 75,000 people, pay for school tuition for 100,000 children and provide food for 75,000 youngsters.
   The international agency's board of directors approved the plan Thursday.
