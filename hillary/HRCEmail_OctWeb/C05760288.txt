Jack--

  I agree w the memo. Also I mentioned the idea of a national security budget today at the Senate hearing in response
to a question by Bill Nelson so the idea is out there in the ether.
  I couldn't tell from the brief description, but will this stop or just slow the IT work and the facility work on Navy Hill?

 Thanks for all your great work. Hillary
