Subject: Strong quake hits southern Japan (AP)

 TOKYO (AP) - A fairly strong earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.8 has hit off the shores of
Japan's southern Okinawa Island.
   Officials said the quake Tuesday about 135 miles (220 kilometers) away from the island was not expected to
cause a tsunami. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.
   Northeastern Japan was devastated by a massive earthquake and tsunami on March 11 that left nearly 20,000
people dead or missing. Japan, which lies along the Pacific "Ring of Fire," is one of the world's most
seismically active countries.
