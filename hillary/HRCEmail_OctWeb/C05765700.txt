I found out late last night that the meeting tomorrow at the WH with POTUS is at 8:00pm, which does affect your dinner
plans. Should we still move forward with the dinner (currently starting at 7:00pm), with you needing to depart around
7:50pm? Move up the start time by 15-30 minutes? Or consider postponing?

I think the PM of Turkey is coming Dec 7. Have we been asked to do anything for him? I want to be sure we treat him
and his party well. If WH doesn't do lunch, should we?

                                                 Have you been told what time yet?

Pls keep Dec 1, 2 and 3 free and plan for me to go to Brussels either night of 12/2 or 3.

Also, which shuttles have you held for Wed?
