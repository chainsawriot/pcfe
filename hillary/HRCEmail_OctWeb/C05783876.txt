UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Pakistan, Morocco and Guatemala were elected Friday to the 15-nation U.N.
Security Council for 2012 and 2013.

  Guatemala ran unopposed, but needed to secure a two-thirds majority in the 193-nation General Assembly. It
won 191 votes. Pakistan scraped through in the first round of voting with the minimum required 129 votes
while Morocco received 151 votes.

   There will be a second round of voting for two more seats, one in Africa between Togo and Mauritania and
one in Eastern Europe between Azerbaijan, Slovenia and Hungary.
