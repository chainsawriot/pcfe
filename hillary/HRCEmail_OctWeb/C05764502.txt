Dear Dave,


Several people have revisited an idea I know you have heard before —that ISAF, the UN, and
the U.S. Mission buy some of their food on the local economy. This would:
       •    provide a source of rapid income to farmers;
       •    reduce somewhat the amount of resupply convoys;


I have asked MG Field to look into this. I know that there are health and security issues, but
perhaps there are ways to deal with them on a local basis. Richard Holbrooke
