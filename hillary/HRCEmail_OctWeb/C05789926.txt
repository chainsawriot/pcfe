You are currently leaving for Syracuse about 10:00am -- I will have a draft schedule for you later today which I will pass
to Monica. Will touch base with Kris.

Time Dinner -- Dan Schwerin is lead pen and has spoken to Jake about his outline. It is black tie.

Sounds good on May 10-14th.

Defer to Huma on her outline for the early June trip.

I have a call with Terry today about the California trip but I am sure Huma has the best information. I am vetting the
private plane that they have lined up so we can have that as an option although they were not sure about wheels
up/down yet.

When do I have to leave for Syracuse on the 23rd?
                                                 I don't have the schedule for day so don't know what's possible.
I know I have to be back in DC for the dinner at State.

What do you know about the Time dinner and who's working on remarks--they should be funny and short. Is it black tie?

I will stay in NY May 10-13 and come back during day on 14th.



And I will be in NY May 25-28 and come back early the 29th and leave as planned for Tromso on the 30th, spend day of
31st there, then to Oslo.
What happens in what order on the 1st-8th? What do I do in Istanbul the 7th and 8th besides the Forum? Am I still doing
Armenia, Georgia and Azer? I could go right to NY from Andrews for weekend and come back to DC morning of the 11th.

Any further thoughts about event I could do in California either evening of Thursday June 14 or morning of 15th? If not,
pls book commercial flight for evening of 14. What is schedule?'

Some options:
- May 10th-15th. Stay in NYC after womens breakfast and come back in time for FAPE dinner on the 15th. Unless we
attempt to move FAPE to the 17th which will give you 2 more days.
- May 25-30th: Extend Memorial day weekend. Depart for norway on the 31st, do oslo on the 1st, do tromso on back
end.                                                                                                               B6
- June is an impossible month
- July we can keep July 18th-30th open for you. But that might be too far down the road?
Let me know what you think.
