Subject: More Bangkok residents advised to flee floodwaters (AP)


BANGKOK (AP) - Bangkok authorities are telling more residents to leave as floodwaters threaten southwestern
neighborhoods in the Thai capital.
   Governor Sukhumbhand Paribatra said people should evacuate three neighborhoods due to surging water
levels. He said November 13 pumps were operating around the clock and more pumps were being added to help
drain the water.
   Still, floodwaters are receding elsewhere. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra said previously the city center
would have light flooding if the water penetrated that far but western areas of Bangkok were threatened with
inundation.
   The national death toll from floods since late July has reached 536. More than 13.1 million people - one in
five Thais - are affected.
