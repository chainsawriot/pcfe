  FYI:
  (SBU) Kenya: Troop Integration? According to press reports, the Kenyan Cabinet has
  approved the AU Peace and Security Council's request for Kenyan Defense Forces to join
  AMISOM as part of AU's strategy to combat Al-Shabaab. A statement issued in Nairobi after
  the Cabinet meeting, chaired by President Kibaki, said the move is subject to Parliamentary
  approval. According to post, however, the picture is a bit less clear. Reportedly, the GOK
  agreed to "integrate" into AMISOM but AF is trying to clarify what this means.
