The tasker was about the letter - we can do that next week.

We still need points for the phone call - by COB. I'll type something up now.

Kemy,

Assuming the tasker of yesterday for a S response to the French Foreign Minister is no longer active?

We are heading to our plane so apologize for quick summary:.

Here is a readout of Executive Sessions is:
- Board voted 15-3 with 2 abstentions to remove MK. Because France, EC, and Gates opposed, and Japan and Italy/Spain
abstained, there was a blocking veto (under GF rules, more than 1/3 of either donor or implementer bloc)
- Board authorized Chair/Vice-Chair to appoint General Manager for up to 12 months who would report directly to the
Board
- Board found MK's performance to be poor, particularly in internal management issues
- Chair and Vice-Chair would work with MK to develop an exit strategy by 12/15. MK will have choice to resign, stay (in
newly-defined ED role), or fight in court.
- If MK stays, Board Chair and Vice-Chair will redefine role that focuses on external issues Special Advisor for Global
