DATE/DATE: January 16, 2012 1:30 p.m.
LOCATION/ENDROIT: Teleconference, Ottawa, Ontario
PRINCIPAL(S)/PRINCIPAUX:          Joseph Lavoie, Press Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs; The Honourable John
                                        Baird, Minister of Foreign Affairs
SUBJECT/SUJET:          Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird Holds a News Conference to Discuss His Trip to Haiti to Meet
with President Michel Martelly and Prime Minister Garry Conille for Discussion on Topics Including Governance
Improvements and Earthquake Recovery.

Joseph Lavoie:            Hello, everyone. This is Joseph Lavoie here, Press Secretary for the Minister. Thank you very
much for being patient. We apologize for the short delay. Merci a tous pour nous avoir rejoint aujourd'hui. The Minister
is standing by. He's in the middle of a busy day in Port-au-Prince with the parliamentarian delegation, including his
colleagues Dominic LeBlanc and Helene Laverdiere. I will turn it over to the Minister who can provide a short statement
and then we will open it up for a couple calls. Minister.

Hon. John Baird:                Merci beaucoup. Thank you very much for being with us. I was pleased to day to visit
Haiti and to meet with President Michel Martelly and Prime Minister Conille. I conveyed to them Canada's continued
support for their government and the Haitian people. During these meetings, I took the opportunity to underscore
Canada's continued concern with the political stability in Haiti, combatting corruption, support for an independent judiciary
and the establishment of a capable and professional police force are key for the long-term development of this country.

These challenges have hampered Haitian development over the last 25 years. The earthquake of two years ago only
compounded pre-existing problems. I am pleased to see Haiti's leaders demonstrating the political will to tackle these
tough challenges. I also made clear to the Haitian Ieadership•that the Canadian government does not support the re-
establishment of the Haitian Army. I expressed concern and I had a good dialogue with them on this issue and got their
perspective which was helpful.

And I will this afternoon have the opportunity to visit a police commissariat, a facility that Canada's helping to rebuild. We
are proud of the Canadian police officers, Canadian Forces, Corrections officers supporting the development and
professionalisation of the Haitian National Police to help improve the safety and security of the Haitian people. Prior to
this afternoon I will hold discussions with Canadian companies working here in Haiti. Employment and job creation and
economic growth are the top priority for the Haitian government and Canada's committed to working with them and the
private sector to help facilitate investment in Haiti.

I was pleased to be joined today in the typical nonpartisan style that has always defined my political career by a number of
members of parliament, including the NDP's Helene Laverdiere, the Liberals' Dominic LeBlanc who are both critics as well
as my Parliamentary Secretary Bob Dechert. I hope this trip and their discussions were informative as we look to help
build a brighter and more prosperous Haiti.

Thank you very much. Merci beaucoup. J'etais prat a pris vos questions.

Joseph Lavoie:           I'll leave it to Lee, the operator, to provide instructions on how to leave questions behind or to
