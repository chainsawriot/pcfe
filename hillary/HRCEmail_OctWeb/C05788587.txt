(SBU) Embassy Monrovia comments the situation in Monrovia remains calm.

MONROVIA (Reuters) - Liberian President Ellen Johnson-Sirleafs main rival fled his party headquarters in the
capital Monrovia on Sunday when it was besieged by dozens of supporters angry at his decision to recognise
her government after a disputed November election. â€¢

   Winston Tubman, who had alleged vote-rigging in favour of Johnson-Sirleaf, made his decision before the
Nobel peace laureate's inauguration for a second term on Monday in front of regional leaders and U.S. Secretary
of State Hillary Clinton.

  "The youths stormed the party's headquarters ... We had to get him out of the compound," said Acarous
Gray, secretary-general of Tubman's CDC party.

   An aide to Tubman said he was not injured but had relocated to a local hotel and would return when calm
had returned.
