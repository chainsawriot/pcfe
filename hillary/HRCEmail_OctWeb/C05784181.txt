Tahouni is out. According to him, once he was turned down for Prime Minister, he was offered any job in the cabinet he
wanted, but he declined. He is apparently still working with the TNC on transition issues, but is not and will not be part
of the cabinet.

balanced and adds most of the top appointments are consistent with expectations. The appointment of Ashour

Cabinet positions including Mabrooka Jibril at Social Affairs and Fatima al-Hamroosh at Health. Information
on a few key ministers follows:



(SBU) Foreign Minister: Ashour Ben Khayaal.
