Subject: Afghan Taliban claim killed US officers over Koran burnings (Reuters)


KABUL, Feb 25 (Reuters) - The Afghan Taliban claimed responsibility for the killing of two Americans,
believed to be a colonel and a major in the U.S. military, in Afghanistan's Interior Ministry on Saturday.

  The group said the shootings were in retaliation for the burning of copies of the Muslim holy book at a
NATO base in Afghanistan, which triggered days of widespread protests.
