Her proposal on Israel-Iran:


"Our focus is on our dual track approach of pressure and engagement. That approach has brought the world together
today to condemn Iran's actions, create consequences for those actions and to urge Iran to meet its obligations at the
IAEA and to come clean on their nuclear program."
IF PRESSED: The President has said, as have presidents before him, that Iran acquiring nuclear weapons is unacceptable.
Our entire focus now is on our dual track approach.
IF FURTHER: Yes, all options are on the table though now focus is on dual track approach. Military action is not anyone's
preferred action in the first instance everâ€¢.
