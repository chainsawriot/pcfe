Subject: UPDATE: Egyptian court to rule in Mubarak trial on June 2 (AP)


CAIRO (AP) - An Egyptian judge has set June 2 as the date for the verdict and sentencing in the trial of former
President Hosni Mubarak.
  His lawyer said in his Wednesday closing arguments that Mubarak is still president, meaning the seven-
month trial is invalid.
  Some have criticized the prosecution, saying it has not provided strong enough evidence to support a murder
charge.
  Also on trial in the case are Mubarak's former defense minister and six high-ranking security officers.
Mubarak, his two sons and one associate are also being tried in a separate corruption case.
