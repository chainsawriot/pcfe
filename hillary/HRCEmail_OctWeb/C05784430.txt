  Background: Senator Brown was an original co-sponsor of S.1619, the Currency
  Exchange Rate Oversight Reform Act of 2011, along with Senators Schumer,
  Graham, and Snowe. The bill passed the Senate, by a vote of 63-35, on October
  11, but it is unlikely to move in the House any time soon. After the passage of
  S.1619, Senator Brown said: "We are in a trade war. But today we're fighting
  back with one of the biggest bipartisan jobs bills the Senate has seen this year.
  Today, we put American workers and American manufacturers first by standing up
  to the Chinese."
