Subject: Up to 50,000 flee South Sudan violence - U.N. (Reuters)

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Up to 50,000 people have fled violence in a remote border area of South Sudan, the
United Nations said January 2, after days of clashes between two tribes.

    January 2 some 6,000 armed members of the Lou Nuer tribe attacked the remote town of Pibor in Jonglei
state bordering north Sudan after days of clashes with the rival Murle tribe, U.N. sources said.

   Lise Grande, U.N. humanitarian coordinator for South Sudan, said tens of thousands of civilians had fled
Pibor and nearby towns to escape the violence.

   "We are worried about their conditions. They are without water, shelter and food. They are hiding in the
bush. I think it is between 20,000 and 50,000. This is an estimate only," she told Reuters. She had no
information about casualties.

    South Sudan's armed forces are sending reinforcements to Pibor, army spokesman Philip Arguer said. "They
attacked the town this morning. Civilians were evacuated from Pibor three days ago," he said, without giving
further details.

   U.N. sources said around 3,000 soldiers and 800 policeman were on their way to Pibor. Cattle raids, they
said, had sparked the latest violence.
