Subject: Papal Nuncio

Senators Mikulski, Durbin and Cardin and Cong. Van Hollen met at 4:30 this afternoon with the Papal Nuncio. They
began the meeting with concerns about Alan. Each described the painful situation from their perspective, including, as
you know Senator Durbin's meeting with Alan.
The Papal Nuncio was very sympathetic but not unexpectedly said the request they made (that the Pope raise Alan in
connection with trip to
Cuba) is under consideration, without making a firmer commitment. He said he would be in touch with the Vatican FM.
The members did not know that S had spoken to the FM this afternoon as well. The members are happy to take other
steps as we suggest.
