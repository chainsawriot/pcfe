Hillary: Virginia Military Institute, George C. Marshall's school, through Pat

Lang, would like to give you the Distinguished Diplomat Award. See Pat's note

below. Though you must receive endless invitations, I think this one would be a

particularly good venue for you for a host of obvious reasons, and where you

could deliver a speech. You will have various speeches to give. You can give one

at VMI and get honored. You can respond through me or to Pat directly one way or

another. Also, I had a long conversation with Pat, who has many sources within

the higher echelons of the military, and he describes what the generals are

doing on Afghanistan deployment as a "slow motion mutiny." He believes the White

House trying to counter it through press leaks as though this is a primary

campaign generates contempt. Cheers, Sid

Madame Secretary



I am a 1962 graduate of the Virginia Military Institute.           VMI has always been

predominately a hard science and engineering school. I happen to have been an

English major there. Today, there are more cadets with a "major" or "minor" in

International Relations and Political Science than in any other field. The

whole student body is around 1200 in number and deliberately kept to that size

to keep quality up and to continue to rely on a teaching system that is almost

tutorial in nature.



The Institute's most revered alumnus is George C. Marshall. His library is

there as well as a brand new "Marshall Center for the Study of Leadership and

Ethics."



I am a member of the advisory board of the "International Relations and

Political Science" Department. The Institute (and the department) gives a prize

from time to time to truly "Distinguished Diplomats. " Under that rubric have

been included a few who were not strictly diplomats but who have been of great

service to the United States. Jim Lilley was a recipient as was Susan

Eisenhower, last year's recipient.

When I recently met with the Superintendent of VMI (my classmate), I told him

that you would make an admirable recipient for the "Distinguished Diplomat"

award. He was very welcoming of the idea. You may know him, General (ret.)

JHB Peay.



I enclose a page from the VMI website that described Ms. Eisenhower's award last

year.



VMI now has a substantial number of women cadets.          It seems to me that your

presence there for this purpose would be a great symbol and a vast encouragement

for them.



Best Regards



W. Patrick Lang (Pat)
