on Time, we can make sure they know you want funny and short. at one point, we were talking about using this
opportunity to say something serious/doing some sort of stump speech. as you know, its technically closed press but
that doesnt mean anything given who is in room.
glad you are taking the the days down in ny.
on Scandinavia, the hard dates are 1st for conference, 3rd for sunday lunch on an island with bildt, 5th for georgia
dialogue and 7th for turkey forum. doesnt give us as much flexibility to flip things around. we can do denmark first, then
norway which gives you more time in norway and sweden as an option. armenia/azerbaijan are on itinerary. georgia
dialogue is locked already. at this point, i think we have to go to A and A. i can re-adjust so you dont spend night in
either place. For turkey, the conference is only on the 7th. we blocked the 8th as well in case we need it. we will want to
do some bilateral program (meetings and events) since i dont know when or if we will go back this year.
On California in June,

                                       li dont think we have something in mind for you officially. im floating the idea of
an asia speech there but that might not be the best idea for june. will come back to you.

When do I have to leave for Syracuse on the 23rd?
                                                 I don't have the schedule for day so don't know what's possible.
I know I have to be back in DC for the dinner at State.

What do you know about the Time dinner and who's working on remarks--they should be funny and short. Is it black tie?

I will stay in NY May 10-13 and come back during day on 14th.



And I will be in NY May 25-28 and come back early the 29th and leave as planned for Tromso on the 30th, spend day of
31st there, then to Oslo. What happens in what order on the 1st-8th? What do I do in Istanbul the 7th and 8th besides
the Forum? Am I still doing Armenia, Georgia and Azer? I could go right to NY from Andrews for weekend and come back
to DC morning of the 11th.

Any further thoughts about event I could do in California either evening of Thursday June 14 or morning of 15th? If not,
pls book commercial flight for evening of 14. What is schedule?

Some options:
- May 10th-15th. Stay in NYC after womens breakfast and come back in time for FAPE dinner on the 15th. Unless we
attempt to move FAPE to the 17th which will give you 2 more days.
- May 25-30th: Extend Memorial day weekend. Depart for norway on the 31st, do oslo on the 1st, do tromso on back
end
- June is an impossible month
- July we can keep July 18th-30th open for you. But that might be too far down the road?
Let me know what you think.
