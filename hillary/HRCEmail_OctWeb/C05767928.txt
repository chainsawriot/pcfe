I apologize for the delay in responding. We were planning for tomorrow's commodity lift.

Current status is that planes are landing at the airport but the Govt of Haiti is prioritizing and managing throughput and
that makes its capacity very low and congestion very high.

                                                                                                                             1.4(A)
