Subject: International envoys seek to restart Mideast talks (AP)

JERUSALEM - (AP)         International mediators will be meeting with Palestinian and Israeli officials in
Jerusalem in the hope of finding a formula to restart deadlocked peace talks.
   But in a telling commentary on the state of peacemaking, the envoys will be sitting down separately on
Wednesday with officials from each side and will not be meeting with the Israeli and Palestinian leaders.
   The mission by the Quartet of Mideast peace negotiators follows the Palestinian bid for statehood
recognition, submitted to the United Nations in September.
   Immediately after that application, the Quartet _ representing the U.S., European Union, Russia and U.N. _
called for a resumption of peace talks in a month, with the ambitious goal of reaching a peace agreement by late
2012.
