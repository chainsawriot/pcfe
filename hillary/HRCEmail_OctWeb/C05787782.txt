H,
Sent this missive from Simon to Phil Goldberg and Tom Siebert, but your wishes for a diplomat to attend certainly takes
precedence. Akin to our Wounded Warriors and a room full of intell, security & military Brits in London. Simon offers a
seat among 700 people attending. And....hold tight to that great young lady Huma. A terrific gal , undeserving of such
garbage. Best,
M

                 John Brammer                    Director of Arturus Security Consulting (Former Major 22 Regiment
SAS)
                 Marcus Naraidoo                 Global Partner Intelligence and Security for Price Waterhouse Cooper

                 Simon Cross                     Sales and Marketing Director Becatech
                 Kevin Metcalfe                  Chief Operations Officer Becatech Ltd
                 Myself

I was wondering if there was someone from the US that we might include for the evening. I am not sure who is in town
or who might be at the embassy who might enjoy such an evening but as we are looking at doing more than half of our
trade in the USA over the next few years it might be appropriate to begin to build some bridges with the Embassy here
or, if someone is in country I would be delighted to have them join us. Outline details below:-

Please feel free to advise.

The evening will be hosted by Major General Andrew Salmon (Former Commandant General of the Royal
Marines)

The inaugural Royal Marines Sportsman's Dinner, sponsored by the CBI, is to be held in the beautiful
surroundings of the Hurlingham Club, London, on Wednesday 22nd June 2011. This spectacular event offers a
superb evening of fine cuisine, sport and entertainment, hosted by Martin Bayfield, featuring the Royal Marines
Band, in the company of the best of Britain's Sports Personalities, including Martin Johnson and members of
the current England Rugby Team, Sir Clive Woodward and Jason Leonard and a host of others. The evening
will culminate with a charity auction, offering 'money can't buy' experiences with the Royal Marines chaired by
Jonny Gould and close with entertainment from the Rick Parfitt Junior Band. Further information and access
to the booking form are available via this link: http://www.fireball.co.uk/emailers/rmsd/rmsd.html or as detailed on the
enclosed flyer.

The Sportsman's Dinner seeks to raise essential funds for The C Group, a registered charity supporting the
growing list of Royal Marines that have sustained life-changing injuries on operations, to help them to
overcome their injuries through opportunity, and to establish a pathway for their futures. With 3 Commando
Brigade's deployment to Afghanistan ongoing, and a growing list of Marines requiring our support, there could
be no better time to support this charity.
