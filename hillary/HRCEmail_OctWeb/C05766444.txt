You are right on! Imagine the public outcry here if US dollars are used to pay guys who go on to brutalize women. That's
why we have to take precautions and have guidelines now. We're working on language in the communique. Of course, it
has top get past the afghans. I told HRC I'm already getting emails from concerned women in Kabul after Karzai's
announcement of the program.
Thank you!

Melanne,

I just met with Cheryl Mills, Jake Sullivan, Jack Lew, and Joan Donoghue from L on reintegration and our application for
an OFAC license.




When you return from your trip, we should talk about this some more. I am going to alert our DOD colleagues to begin
sensitizing them to this issue.

Thanks,
Peggy

Peggy, I'm having to leave for the airport, but Ruth never had a chance last night to do the clean up which she is doing
right now. She will get it to you soonest. I believe this step is critical so we avoid future problems. Please work through
any remaining questions with her.

Melanne,

I am sure that S staff will have some edits to this document — we just needed to get a reasonably presentable draft to
the Secretary tonight. But I will feel comfortable if everyone takes another look to make sure all the facts and figures
are accurate and we haven't overlooked anything. Can you folks do another scrub?


Thanks,
Peggy

PS — no, he doesn't read his emails; the staffers get them but ignore them for the most part. He's got a separate
unclass account that he actually reads.

I don't know how much we've done for burn centers. I know they're looking for resources always. Allyson would be the
one or Sepidah.

 However, that reminds me, we should mention that this is an issue that has enjoyed the collaboration of the private
sector and individuals in the US who have come together through the US- Afghan Women's Council to work in tandem
with USG to support Afghan women to meet their critical needs; for example by conducting training programs for
businesswomen and NGO leaders, economic development projects and burn specialists, as a few examples. It's a good
way to show public-private collaboration not just US public money.

Looping in Allison, who is also interested in seeing the Pakistan plan.

Once Ruth and Melanne clear, I think the plan is to send it around ASAP! I understand this has to happen soon, since it
for the Secretary's use in London.

Dear all,

Saba mentioned over the phone that S/GWI is preparing a part on Pakistani women that would be incorporated into
Secretary's speech prepared for London Conference. If possible, desk would like to have a look at it.

Also please let us know if there are further plans on having a section on Pakistani women in the regional stabilization
strategy at this point. I got the understanding that Afghanistan breakout was needed asap. As the discussion on Pakistan
gender strategy are only just beginning, I'm afraid that it is a bit trickier to come up with a similar paper, at least without
a proper discussion.

Best regards,
Hanna

We could in that case put the womens section in the af-pak strategy with other cross-cutting issues, such as ilicit finance,
that apply to both af and pak.

Thanks, Peggy.

VVhile we don't have a Pak plan in the same manner as Afghanistan, I think Melanne wants us to include something on
Pak as well. We actually have a lot of material we can pull from that we had prepared in advance of the Af-pak
consultations with the Egyptians.

I'll get more guidance from Melanne on this and will let you all know.

Folks,

I have roughed out a document in the right format drawn on the action plan (with USAID edits). I will continue fine
tuning it until Joe or Saba arrive and can take over. Saba — did see the version from Melanne. We don't need to worry
about Pakistan in this document. In our stabilization paper that went public, there are Afghan-specific papers and Pak
specific papers. If/when we have a Pakistan strategy, we can include that as well.

We will get something pulled together in the next hour to send around for everyone's review.

I agree that this internal document isn't in a releasable format. We can summarize what's in the plan and include it in the
overall AfPak strat doc.

I went through the draft Saba gave me that is based on the original document and AID's adds, etc.
I don't think the format of that document works for a release for the Secretary and add on to the strategic plan. Liz, need
you to weigh in here.

We also have nothing on Pakistan. How do we add that piece and where.

Finally, Ruth, at some point, you're going to have to take the final decisions that are inserted in the draft and tum it into
something readable.

Attached are my comments, but need to have some guidance from SRAP on format.
