Kris
I'm in LA for Experience LA - give me ring on cell to talk about - sounds good.

Secretary- Your video was a huge hit last night at the Getty dinner. Great response from folks - Kareem, Geena Davis,
Lisa Ling all came to support international efforts at State.
Frank and Carol Biondi send their best.
