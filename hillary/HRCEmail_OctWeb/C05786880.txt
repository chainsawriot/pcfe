Subject:                          AU speech



As is often the case, we have a lot of work to do to distill and sharpen the speech. First, what are the main takeaway
messages? It is too much of a laundry list w/o enough focus. Second, it has buried some of what we are doing w AU that
we can perhaps elevate as deliverables. And, third, the travel log at beginning needs shortening. Pls try to tighten during
day so I can re-read tonight. I also have edits and fact questions, I will raise later.
