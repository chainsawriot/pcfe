Thanks, Tom. I'd love to catch up. I know I'll be at the White House on Tuesday for Mubarak and could stay to meet
after that if it works for you. But if we could talk by phone today, that might be best. I assume, it would have to be
secure?

Madame Secretary--Welcome back and congratulations on a terrific and historic trip.

If it would be useful, I would be happy to come over at the beginning of the week and review where we are on various
interagency issues since you were last state side. Let me know.

Again, congrats.

Tom.
