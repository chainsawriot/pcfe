This event with S and the Egyptian social media outlet was a big success. Great work by Philippe, Caroline Adler, Katie
Dowd and our NEA colleagues. Absolutely hit the mark.

Subject: Quick Readout of Secretary's Dialogue Event with Masrawy

Hello everyone,

Congratulations!!! I thought the interview turned out fantastic!! Great flow of conversation, no technical glitches. And
the Secretary articulated several points that I think will resonate well with the Egyptian audience:
    • The revolution was an Egyptian process, led by Egyptians and for Egyptians. And it is Egyptians alone who will
        determine their future.
    • Egyptians changed history and showed the world the power of non-violent, organized
        demonstrations. Egyptians are smart, talented, and energetic, and I am both inspired and personally convinced
        that they will work together to create a new, democratic Egypt
    • We do not always agree with our friends, and we do not hesitate to communicate, in public and private, our
        disagreement with certain policies. We were a friend to Egypt during the past thirty years, but we also made it
        clear our position that Egypt must adopt reforms that respect the basic human rights and dignity of Egyptians,
        and increase their economic and political opportunities.
    • Our relationship with Egypt allowed us to communicate vital messages during the revolution—like the message
        to refrain from violence and to stop those who were seeking to harm peaceful protestors. We believe those
        messages had an impact.
    • We have a long history of engaging with Egyptian civil society, even when the Egyptian government did not
        agree with some of our efforts, and we will continue to support the Egyptian people in any way we can
    • Egyptians will determine their future leaders. It is not the place of the U.S. to pick winners or losers—what we
        care about is a fair, democratic process, and that those who come to power will adhere to democratic principles,

         refrain from violence, and respect the rights of all Egyptians. Democracy is not just about elections—in a true
         democracy, people adhere to democratic principles after winning power, and we hope to see this in Egypt
    •    My message to the Egyptian people is to stay determined through this democratic transition. It will be hard
         work, but I am confident that the Egyptians can do it if they keep up the momentum, excitement, hope, and
         unity we saw in Tahrir Square during the revolution.

Sincerely,


Amirah Ismail I Press Officer I Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs 1 U.S. Department of State
