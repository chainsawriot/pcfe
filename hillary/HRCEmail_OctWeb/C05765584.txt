Dear Cheryl,

Thank you for your trademark Cheryl timely and clear reply. I had understood that the Secretary and the President were
very close to naming a new leader for USAID. but I wanted to make sure that was the case and that's why I sent you a
follow up missive regarding

I look forward to the announcement and I'm sure the nominee will be a first rate one. USAID is an important
organization that needs renewal, direction and strong leadership as you so well know.

Continued good wishes.

Congratulations on Secretary Clinton's recent extensive trip to Asia and the Middle East. Her schedule was a very full and
demanding one with challenges and complicated diplomatic situations at each stop. As usual, the Secretary handled
each critical encounter with grace, thoughtfulness, strength and good judgment. And she moved the ball forward on the
diplomatic front regarding some of the most critical issues of the day. Donna and I are glad (and relieved) that Hillary is
back in the United States safe and secure. And one more point-many of the pictures of the Secretary's trip were great
and so descriptive. They told the story in and of themselves.


Cheryl, what is the current status of the USAID appointment? You'll recall I had made a couple of recommendations for
your and the Secretary's consideration. It's my understanding that the decision is still an open one and I simply wanted
to stay in touch about this important responsibility.


As always, thank you for your consideration. More importantly, thank you for your dedicated support and wise counsel
to Hillary and service to our country.


Personally,
Mack
