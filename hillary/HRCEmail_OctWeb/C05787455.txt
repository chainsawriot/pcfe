Cheryl: I don't know what Amb Gips or the embassy were planning to do vis a vis this event, but I can check with them. I
am sure Don or his DCM would probably attend some of the ceremony out of diplomatic and historical courtesy




                                                                         We stand ready to follow-up. Johnnie. Have a
Happy New Year. Jc

Johnnie

I returned Jesse Jackson Sr's call to S. He is seeking to speak to her regarding his pending visit next week to S.A. to
celebrate the ANC's anniversary and would like to be able to represent her/Admin thinking on any issues/opportunities
that might arise.

Can you advise what the nature of this anniversary is for the ANC (how many years and scope of celebration);
                                                        and any background/guidance                         to share
with him

Thanks.
