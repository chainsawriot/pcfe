If we go to Paris,



Also, if we go to Paris, I assume I will come back that same night. If that's right, can I either land at Westchester or fly up

If I don't go to Paris, how will we add one more trip since I doubt I can go to Haiti?

Are we now thinking of flying to Munich Thursday night instead of Fri morning?

When I go to Hawaii for APEC,
                         Huma has contact info.

Sending you copy of letter from Dick Blum inviting me to speak at his poverty center at Berkeley.

Also need to find out dates for Japanese PM visit from WH.
