Subject: A message for the Secretary ...


Cheryl and Huma,


Could you let the Secretary know that her visit to Bangladesh was a triumph for advancing America's interests in this
country of growing strategic importance to America. As I told her as she prepared to embark her plane and depart from
Dhaka, my staff and I will nurture well the many seeds she planted here to promote our agenda.


The Secretary's greatest legacy in bolstering U.S.-Bangladesh relations is, no doubt, her wondrous TownTerview with
Bangladesh's amazing youth. Her electrifying engagement with the young people has already been watched by tens of
millions; scores of millions more will watch (and rewatch) over coming weeks. Even hardened Bangladeshi skeptics
acknowledge that the Secretary hit that one out of the ballpark. The Secretary's engagement with youth will be the gift
that keeps giving in helping the people and leaders of Bangladesh see and appreciate America at our best.


Madam Secretary, I thank you so much for leaving this rich legacy with us.


Dan Mozena



PS Huma, a special thank you to you for your guiding hand in ensuring the trip's success.
