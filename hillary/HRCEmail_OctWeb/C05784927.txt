Subject: My most sincere thanks

Dear Cheryl,

It was with enormous pride in my country that I read about the Secretary's
address in Geneva regarding, the advocacy by the United States for the rights of
gay and lesbian people throughout the world. Living abroad, I well understand
the risks many face and know we cannot take for granted the hard-won progress we
enjoy at home.

Please pass my thanks to all of you in the administration, especially the
Secretary, who made this historic policy announcement a reality.

Best,

Peter
