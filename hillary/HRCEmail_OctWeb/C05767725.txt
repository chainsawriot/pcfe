We got back from Ukraine in the high winds which were kind of a metaphor for the situation in Kyiv.
The US presence was greatly appreciated. I saw the Pinchuk's who send their best....also Mrs. Kuchma!
The meeting with Yanykovych went very well. Gen Jones did a good job and Y said all the right things about IMF,
integration with the West,etc. He is coming to DC in April for the nuclear summit but said he'd like to come sooner as
well. Jones told him that you would like to visit at some point and he was pleased at that prospect, asked for help and
seemed eager to cooperate in every way. Of course, the future will tell whether these are words, what the Russians will
do, etc. Its a complicated situation but needs our leadership. I'm sure Phil G will be giving you the full readout .1 met with
some of the key women activists and felt we were back in the 90's because of the recidivism in so many areas that's
taking place there. Thank you for putting me on the delegation.

I Just met this morning with Sen Lugar and he said you were terrific in your hearing and he was very pleased at what you
had said on Law of the Seas. He also was pleased to hear that we were working on conflict minerals re: DRC and thought
his bill on transperency provided a good approach. I told hm that on your trip there, you elevated this issue and have
been working on it since.

I know you're meeting with the 5 Koreans today. They have the G20 presidency next year and many of the
parliamentaians and other officials want to put economic growth and investing in women-run SME's high on the agenda.
