Not sure what timeline you received but ill get on top of this.
Not sure S/P is aware                      so timeline wouldn't have come from our team. I'll discuss this with you .4(C)

Adding Lona, Monica and Rob who have my scheduling records. What bothers me is that S/P prepared the timeline but
it doesn't include much of what I did. So where did they get info? This is example of my continuing concern that we
don't have our records ready.

This timeline is totally inadequate (which bothers me about our recordkeeping). For example, I was in Paris on 3/19
when attack started. That's not on timeline. What else is missing? Pls go over it asap.
