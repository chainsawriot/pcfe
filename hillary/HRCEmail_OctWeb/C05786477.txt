Subject: Germany says still sceptical on Libya no-fly zone (Reuters)


PARIS (Reuters) - Germany remains sceptical about the idea of imposing a no-fly zone over Libya but the issue
should be discussed urgently by the U.N. Security Council, Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said on
Monday.
   Westerwelle, in Paris for a meeting of G8 foreign ministers, said a no-fly zone would still constitute military
intervention and Germany does not want to get dragged into a war. France, the meetings host, wants the G8 to
show strong support for a no-fly zone.
