Hillary: As I explained to you on the phone, I don't think it is appropriate to tell them that I will come only if they agree in
advance to release the women. Your response was, in effect, "They have already agreed." Is this correct? If not, I will go,
by commercial airline if necessary, representing The Carter Center, and try to induce them to approve the release. JC
