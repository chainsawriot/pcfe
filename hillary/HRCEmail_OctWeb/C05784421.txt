Subject: US vacating air base in Pakistan used by drones (AP)

ISLAMABAD (AP) - The U.S. ambassador to Pakistan says Washington is complying with Islamabad's
demand to vacate an air base that has been used by American drones.
   Pakistan gave the U.S. until Dec. 11 to vacate Shamsi air base in southwest Baluchistan province after NATO
airstrikes killed 24 Pakistani soldiers.
   Ambassador Cameron Munter said in an interview with local TV on Monday that the U.S. is doing
everything it can to vacate Shamsi by the deadline.
   The move is not expected to significantly curtail U.S. drone attacks in Pakistan since the base was only used
to service drones that had mechanical or weather difficulties.
   The U.S. does not publicly acknowledge the drone program in Pakistan. But American officials have said
privately that the strikes have killed many militants.
