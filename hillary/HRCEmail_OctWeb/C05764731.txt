Cheryl,

      Here are the quick answers that my folks were able to obtain to your questions last night. Per your e-mail and
Rich Greene's suggestion, I am contacting AID to make clear we want this to happen. Dan

. What are the donated goods?
A- food (rice, coffee, canned goods) water, clothing, tents and blankets.

2. Why don't the Samoans need this?
A- OFDA has determined that in this, as in other emergencies, needs can be met locally. It is burdensome in an
emergency situation to ask people on the ground to receive these types of donations, process and distro them. Monetary
donations accomplish much more and stimulate local economy.

3. How much?
A. 335,000 USD from California to Pago Pago.
