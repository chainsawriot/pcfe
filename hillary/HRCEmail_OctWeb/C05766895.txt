Subject:                           Happy Birthday!


I have to head to NY very early in the morning and wanted to wish you a Happy Birthday and a successful and safe trip to
Pakistan. It is clearly one of the most important missions you've ever embarked on --- and there have been many.

We had a good gathering at the Mahmood's for the new foundation. Holbrooke was in good form. I think the discussion
went a long way to persuading some of the skeptics that it was important to get the foundation off the ground and to
sustain it over the years to come. I'm going to meet with some of the women as a follow up. Some have projects that
they are already supporting; others feel we (AID) doesn't listen to advice on the ground, etc, etc. It can't hurt and may
even help!

Whitney told me she talked to you about the Women's Fund. Yes, we are planning to have DRC be one of the key areas
to target support.

As they say in Ukraine, "mnohaya lita" -- wishing you many years to come!
