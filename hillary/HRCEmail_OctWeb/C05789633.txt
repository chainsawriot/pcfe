Subject: Restatement June 12 Meeting

Harold, Bill, Dave:

Attached is a very rough and very preliminary outline of one possible approach to the June 12 meeting, based on
conversations to date among Lance, Paul Stephan and me. Paul is looking at it tonight, and we are discussing it with
Lance tomorrow at 11 EST. I welcome any thoughts, from the conceptual to the micro. Before tomorrow's conversation
would be ideal, but I realize that life may not allow that.

Dave -- where will you be on June 12?

Best to all,

Sarah
