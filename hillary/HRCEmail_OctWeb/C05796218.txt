Here's the moment I knew we were from an entirely different world than what the midshipmen experience at
Annapolis, let alone where they're headed next...



Philippe, speaking to the dinner table, referring to Dorothy McAuliffe: "Not only is Dorothy the mother of a plebe, but
she and her husband Terry are close and old friends of the Clintons"

Midshipman                 Oh wow, what does your husband do?"                                                            B6

Philippe: "The real question is, what DOESN'T Terry do?"

Dorothy: "ha ha ha... Well, for instance, he helped President Clinton build his library..."

Midshipman          "Oh, wow. So he's an architect?"                                                                      B6
