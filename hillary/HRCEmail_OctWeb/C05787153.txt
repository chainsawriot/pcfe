Dear Huma,

Sorry for the delay in getting a shopping list together. It has been a busy week. Do you have an advance person
here? Do you need me to make any arrangements for you? I know many of the shop owners/designers I am
recommending (but not all of them.)

Art and Antiques

Chinese antiques — Hollywood Road- one shop after the other.

Chinese antique pottery.                    always go to the Arch Angel on Hollywood Road. They have a couple of
shops but the one with the pottery is at 53-55 Hollywood Road. Arch Angel has an art gallery across the street.

Teresa Coleman- Hollywood Road- Beautiful antique Chinese fabrics and garments. Some old maps, too.

Wattis Fine Art- 2/F, 20-22 Hollywood Road- great collection of antique maps and a few old prints of HK and Asia.

Art- many galleries are also on Hollywood Road as well as the extension of the road on Wyndham Street. Some Chinese
art but lots of Vietnamese art.

Clothing and Jewelry

Shanghai Tang on Pedder Street- a must for everyone visaing Hong Kong. Beautiful updated version of Chinese style.

Sandra D'Auriol- she makes beautiful jewelry and all of her profits go to charity- primarily to a children's charity in
Nepal. She has some items in Sin Sin gallery but probably much more in her home. We would have to ask her to bring

some things to you or into Sin Sin as her home is                                       and may not be convenient for       B6
you to go out there. I am happy to call Sandra for you.

Kai-Yin Lo- famous international jewelry designer using Chinese motifs. She shows her jewelry by appointment at her
home                             I can call her and arrange for you to see her stuff if you would like.                     B6

KS Sze- Princes Building and Mandarin Oriental Hotel- Beautiful jewelry in gold, gems, pearls. Hong Kong is a great
place to buy quality jewelry at a reasonable price. The owner of this generation old family business is                     B6
who is moving back to take over the family business. I can email him to or just call the store and make arrangements with
     there who has sold jewelry to        for many years.                                                                   B6

Chow Tai Fook- traditional jade pieces.

LIII LIII- great handmade shoes and purses. They'll ship them. They make Birkin-like bags- no logos and perfectly legal-
not cheap but certainly much cheaper than the original. They make any pairs of shoes you might want- have hundreds or
pairs to chose from or design your own. They measure your foot and the shoes always fit very well. The shop is located
in eh Admiralty Center at 18 Harcourt Road.

These are just a few of my suggestions. If I knew what you might be looking for, I can make other suggestions. There is
a great little foldout guidebook with fabulous shopping recommendations- LUXE Guide Hong Kong. Mine is a few years
old and the guidebooks are updated every 3 months or so. It is treasure trove of information on eating and shopping- my
two favorite things.

Let me know what else you might be interested in shopping for and I'll make additional suggestions.

See you Monday and do let me know if there is anything else I can do for you.

My Best,

Nancy
