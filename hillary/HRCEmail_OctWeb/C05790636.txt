  Subject: FYI for S re tomorrow's dinner

  Wanted to flag for S that at dinner tomorrow night at Ambassador Westamacott's residence will be 2 of Cameron's top
  advisers who are huge fanboys. Steve Hilton (Cameron's best friend and top political comms advisor) kept a Hillary
â€¢ poster in his office. Rohan Silva is Cameron's 30something policy wunderkind and an admirer of equal fervor.

   Both are friends and have been helpful to us on things large and small.

   Wanted to insert this human nugget into her prep materials.



   Alec Ross
   Senior Advisor for Innovation
   Office of the Secretary of State
