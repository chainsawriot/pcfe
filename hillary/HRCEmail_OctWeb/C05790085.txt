  Dear Huma,

  Felicia Wong gave me your address. I write to request some help, on behalf of the Roosevelt Institute whose board of
  directors I chair.

  We have asked Secretary Clinton to receive the FDR Distinguished Public Service Award at our Washington DC dinner at
  the end of July ( or any time she is available ). While I know that Mrs. Clinton has received "Roosevelt" awards before,
  that is exactly the point. She is continuing to serve, to play big roles in making our nation's history, in such a remarkable
  way that we feel it is totally appropriate to recognize the continuing chapters of her service.

  I am particularly asking on behalf of our youth movement, called the Roosevelt Institute Campus Network - 12,000
  students on over 110 campuses across the country. They are a prominent part of this event, and they hold Mrs. Clinton
  in such high esteem.

  We would be so honored if she would accept this award. Can you help persuade her?

  With much appreciation,

  Anna Eleanor Roosevelt
