Just to clarify, it was not my sense from talking to the French that a departure by Aristide was imminent. The SAG position
remains that if he decides to go, they would not prevent him from leaving. Ambassador Gips will return to Pretoria in an
hour and can reach out to the Dep Foreign Minister to see where things stand. Helen

Walter: Many thanks for your help so far. As you might imagine, there is already great concern, both here at State on
7th floor,          about statement and possibility that he might try to return. WHA/CAR is in touch with AF, but we
are being asked to reach out to you all as well. Is your ambassador in country? Many thanks, Roberta

    Haiti's exiled former president vows to
    return       GUARDIAIV.CO.UK 15 Jan lo
    Jean-Bertrand Aristide says he is ready to help rebuild Haiti in wake of
    earthquake

    A tearful Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the exiled former president of Haiti, announced his intention today
    to return to his quake-devastated homeland.

    Aristide, who has been based in South Africa since he was ousted in a 2004 rebellion, said he wanted
    to help rebuild his country in the wake of Tuesday's disaster, thought to have killed tens of thousands.

    "We feel deeply and profoundly that we should be there, in Haiti, with them, trying our best to
    prevent death," Aristide told a press conference at an airport hotel in Johannesburg, standing
    alongside his wife, Mildred. He said friends were ready to give him a plane to return with emergency
    supplies.

    Tears streaming down his face, Aristide continued: "We cannot wait to be with our sisters and
    brothers in Haiti. We share the anguish of all Haitians in the diaspora who are desperate to reach
    family and loved ones.

    "As far as we are concerned we are ready to leave today, tomorrow, at any time to join the people of
    Haiti, to share in their suffering, help rebuild the country, moving from misery to poverty with
    dignity."

Aristide's wife stood with her eyes downcast, twisting a handkerchief. Both dabbed their eyes as they
left after the brief statement.

A South African foreign affairs ministry official, Saul Kgomotso Molobi, said Aristide would not take
questions because "the situation is difficult and unbearable for the family". He added that South
Africa knew of no plans for Aristide to return to Haiti.
Aristide was a priest in the Haitian slum of La Saline before becoming the country's first elected
president in 1990. He was ousted in a military coup the following year, then restored to power by US
troops in 1994.

After stepping down, he was re-elected in 2000 but ousted again in a bloody 2004 rebellion.

He has rarely spoken in public since he was flown to South Africa on a US plane, though he released a
statement earlier this week expressing solidarity with Haitians.

"It is a tragedy that defies expression, a tragedy that compels all people to the highest levels of human
compassion and solidarity," he said.

Haitian protesters have periodically called for Aristide's return over the years. In speeches relayed to
supporters in Haiti from South Africa, he has hinted at going back, but said he merely wants to be a
teacher.

Aristide and his wife live with their two daughters in a government villa in Pretoria. The couple have
embraced an academic life, with Aristide writing on the linguistics of Zulu and Haitian Creole, as well
as on the theology of love.
