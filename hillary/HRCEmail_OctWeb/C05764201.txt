       'MEMORANDUM


       From: Director of Communication, ISAF and USFOR-A
       To:    CDEA, Ambassador Wayne

       SUBJECT: UPDATE ON PLAN FOR PROVIDING CELLULAR TELEPHONE
       SERVICE FROM FORWARD OPERATING BASES (FOB) IN RC-SOUTH AND
       RC-EAST

       1, PLAN FOR CELLULAR SERVICE IN RC-SOUTH


           a. CONTEXT. The Telecommunications Sub-Working Group met .
       for the second time on September 23, 2009. USAID, IPA, IRM,
       USPOR-A, ISAF, ECON and CDEA were represented. Task Force 41
       (Ty 41) briefed the group on the most recent plan for
       providing cellular phone service through towers-on-wheels
       located on U.S. FOBs in RC-S.. As discussed previously, this
       mobile network will increase government legitimacy; build
       Afghan infrastructure; ensure reliable emergency coordination,
       and enhance the effectiveness of government and military and
      .security efforts. The current plan is summarized below .

            b. UPDATE.


             (l) Towers-on-Wheels for FOBs. ISAF Director of
       Communication' has proposed to establish a secure government
       wireless network constructed with the cooperation of the
       Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT)
       and managed under the auspices of Afghan Telecom (Aftel). The
       network's primary purpose would be for emergency response and
       as a command and control network for Afghan government and.
       military and security personnel. Due to DOD funding


       I ISAP as it applies to DirecLor of Communication and communication funding
       ezforts is used as short fox ISM' and USFOR-A in case of funding
       expondiLure limitations by either authority.

            restrictions, .ISAF will not own the towers, but will lease
            them from a vendor on a one-year basis with a renewal option.
         This DOD contractor (most likely an American company) will
        - provide maintenance and technical .support with staff living
         and working on the selected FOBs. ISAF. is looking into
        'employing an American telecom to provide service for ANSFr
         GIRoll and FOB use through the towers-on-wheels on FOBs.
         Because of the technological and logistical complexities
         involved, only an American company would be able to provide
         service, which would be provided under Aftel's name to
         increase government legitimacy for the local population.

              (2)Commercial Provider Options. Commercial cellular
        providers will have the option of co-using the towers-on-
        wheels for their equipment by potentially renting the space
        from the MCIT. ISAF will have to get a legal opinion as to the
        propriety of this action- ISAF will facilitate an agreement
        with MCIT to offer this space on the towers to any cellular
        providers and independent radio and TV networks, with the
      . ministry acting as service broker. As the security situation
        improves, Afghan commercial providers will also have the
        option to assist in expanding their network through community-
        based towers.i

               0) This is phase one of a complex operation, which
        .focuses on RC South initially due to the tactical situation,
         but. will be planned to expand into other RCs. Additionally,
         planning is under way in future phases to introduce mobile
         cell towers to remote communities, based off of this secure
         system. This Will be defined later as the "community-based
         cell initiative."

              (4) Handover plan being- developed by DOS/USAID. DOD
        will support expansion of the Afghan Telecom network
        throughout PC-South, while a DOS/OSAID team is looking into
        options for State "Communication and Counter Propaganda" money
        to donate the towers to GiRoA or use the network to further
        build infrastructure for commercial providers. This handover
        plan is - essential and should include a designated buyer for
        the towers at the end of ISAFis lease (possibly USG/
        Communication Directorate, USAID, CERP funds or GIRoA) to
        ensure service continues. For example, the 'USG. could buy the
       â€¢towers and give them to GIRoA for commercial use. The buyout
        cost is estimated at $4 to $5 million, depending on the number

       , of towers, This will, not include service of towers unless
        specified, which will increase the cost significantly.

             c, NEXT' STEPS


              (1)1SAF/ Task Force 41: Task Force 41 is conducting a
        detailed assessment and cost analysis on the towers-on-wheels
        program, which will include 20-40 to-be-determined locations.
        in RC-South. TF 41's technical planning will be complete at
        the end of October,. The towers' proposal should be approved
        by COMISAF by the end of November, which would be followed by
        a tender process and transport of the towers. Towers could be
        operational in Spring 2010. As total costs will be in the tens
        of millions, budget and corresponding number of towers will be
        determined by COMISAF's approval at the end of TF 41'$ cost
        assessment.

              (2)DOS/USAID: Representatives from ECON, IPA, PAS, and
        USAID will be meeting this week to discuss options to take
        over the lease or buy the towers at the end of ISAF's lease so
        they can remain in place and in use by local communities.

              (3)MCIT: We recommend a meeting with Minister Sangin to
        make clear to him the following points: 1) ISAF and DOS are
        working together on cellular provider expansion and will
        include MCIT as appropriate when planning progresses 2) MCIT
        will not own the towers; 3) Maintenance and upkeep of the
        towers will be handled by the DOD contractors on the FOB, not
        MCIT or Aftel; 4) MOTT may be able to charge a nominal fee
        from commercial cellular providers and media outlets for tower
        space. ISAF does not plan to include private cellular
        providers in the planning process at this point, due to
        security concerns and pending COMISAF approval.
