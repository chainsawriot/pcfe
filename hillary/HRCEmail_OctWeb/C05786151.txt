       Serial No. 11-1383

       Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton
       Secretary of State of the United States
       Washington, DC

       Dear Secretary Clinton:

       During the course of the Fifteenth Anniversary joint Review of the Compact of Free Association
       between the United States and Palau, I had to convey disappointment at times with positions
       taken by some Department of State personnel. I am writing today, however, to compliment the
       letter that Acting Assistant Secretary Rodriguez sent Chairman Bingaman of the U.S. Senate
       Committee on Energy and Natural Resources April 5th regarding the Senate bill to implement the
       Agreement produced by the Review and also to compliment the efforts that Deputy Assistant
       Secretary Reed has made regarding the Agreement.

       The letter and efforts have displayed deep understanding of the relationship between our freely
       associated states and the mutual benefits flowing from this special association as well as what is
       needed to approve the Agreement and continue the association.

       Let me also take this opportunity to express great appreciation for the instrumental actions that
       you and members of your staff took to resolve Review issues, for work done by then Deputy
       Secretary Lew, and for the involvement of Assistant Secretary Campbell. This attention was
       absolutely critical to obtaining agreement. I took very seriously the advice given through Jeff
       Farrow last summer that the Review should be concluded so that an agreement could be approved
       last year and am grateful for the opportunity that we then had to finally negotiate the issues as
       well as for Secretary Reed being the negotiator.

       Although the Agreement ultimately was sent to the U.S. Congress this year, I am confident that
       continued perceptive efforts, such as those by Secretaries Reed and Rodriguez, will result in a
       continuation of the free association between our nations.

       Sincerely yours,




         hnson Toribiong
       President
       Republic of Palau
