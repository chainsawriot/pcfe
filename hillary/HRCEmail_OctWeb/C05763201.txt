Madame Secretary -- it is very late at night here in Hawaii and I just finished an incredible day working with the Chinese
on the S and ED, meeting with Admiral Keating at Pearl Harbor to discuss our Pacific strategy (he will join us now for our
meetings with the Chinese which is very good and projects the right message), and finally greeting and meeting with the
Emperor and his wife on their visit here. It was just one of those wonderful days and I just wanted to say thank you a
million times for having the confidence in me, sticking with me, and giving me this chance. I will do everything in my
power to fulfill and deserve that trust. On to Tokyo and see you in Thailand. Best Kurt

Hillary: As I explained to you on the phone, I don't think it is appropriate to tell them that I will come only if they agree in
advance to release the women. Your response was, in effect, "They have already agreed." Is this correct? If not, I will go,
by commercial airline if necessary, representing The Carter Center, and try to induce them to approve the release. JC
