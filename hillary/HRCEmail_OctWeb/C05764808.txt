Jake/Cheryl:

Attached is the revised Afghanistan script. At RCN's request, it is clearly linked to the slides and papers that we
submitted.                                                      everyone was receptive to the civilian strategy outlined.

We understand that the current plan is for the Secretary to participate via VTC or phone and the script has her leading
throughout, then passing to RCH and/or Amb. Eikenberry.

One new development:                                                                Discussion of the ANSF will now
precede discussion of reintegration/reconciliation. We have kept the "ANSF Hurdles Slide Package" separate (sent on
the high side), but noted in the script where that can be referenced. We anticipate Amb. Eikenberry will also be ready to
discuss his concerns regarding the proposed ANSF build-up.

I'm reachable through ops; feel free to call to discuss any changes you want made. With the meeting at 9:45am, we
should ideally have the script locked no later than 8:30am so everyone involved can read through it one last time.

Thanks for your patience with us and incredibly useful suggestions for improving the presentation.

Best,
        UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764808 Date: 10/30/2015
