Subject: last night's Clinton PBS movie

Stephanie, it all went very well. We saw the 3rd hour (1994 mid terms through the 1996 re â€”elect). Lots of people were
quoted and the footage was just great to see...it was like reliving history. Other than having to even look at Dick Morris
pontificating and Mark Penn doing what he does, I did not find it at all disturbing thus far. I think the last hour will be a
little more uncomfortable, it will pick up in 1997 through the end...

What was nice is that all the people involved with making it including those from PBS and Barack Goodman, who wrote
it, seemed very positive about WJC, his presidency in the context of history and his post Presidency, and all he is
doing....his continued pursuit on behalf of others. His frailties or human weaknesses were not all that much a part of it...
and were included in a balanced way..no signs of any "smear job" in segment 3, and DeeDee said she saw 1 and 2 and
did not see it at as a problem.

The panel which also had Don Baer, in addition to Harold and John Harris was well presented by the acting director of
the Museum of American History at the Smithsonian (who during the pre reception shared his fond admiration of
Evelyn!).

I'd say the audience was impressed, and based upon their questions during the Q&A, very well informed. There was
surely a lot of Clinton love in the theater.

When asked to sum up President Clinton in one word, Don said "possibility", John stuck with "survivor" (the name of his
biography on WJC), Harold said "faith"... quick to make it not religious, but faith in himself, his commitment and mostly
in the American people. That's one thing we can all appreciate.

Steph, please let Bruce know, and thanks for the huge vote of confidence! J.
