Subject: Moving forward on Syria

Cheryl,

Just an FYI that I'm going to move forward on Fulbright in Syria. We will permit the nominated students to proceed in
the program and travel (if able) for the coming academic year, but we will not recruit for a new cycle of participants,
given the lack of PD infrastructure in Syria at this time.
