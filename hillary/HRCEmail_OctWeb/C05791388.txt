Subject: Colombia rebels say freeing all 'prisoners of war' (AP)


BOGOTA, Colombia - (AP) Colombia's main rebel group says it will free the last of the government captives
it has held for years. It also says it will abandon the practice of kidnapping.
   The leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia says on its website that it will free 10 "prisoners of war"
and says they are the last in their control.
   The government says the rebel group holds at least 12.
   A liberation could help advance toward negotiations to end the long civil conflict since the government says
all of the hostages must be freed before talks can start.
   The group said on Dec. 27 it would free six of the hostages but it has delayed that action.
