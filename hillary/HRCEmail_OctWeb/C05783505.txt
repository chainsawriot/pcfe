Subject: UNESCO reprimands Israel over newspaper cartoon (AP)

JERUSALEM - (AP) Israel says UNESCO has reprimanded the country's envoy over a newspaper cartoon
showing Israeli prime minister telling pilots to bomb the U.N. agency's office after bombing Iran.
  Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor says UNESCO handed Ambassador Nimrod Barkan a
protest note saying the cartoon "endangers the lives of unarmed diplomats."
  The cartoon was published last week in the liberal daily Haaretz.
  It depicts Benjamin Netanyuahu with pilots before a hypothetical attack on Iran, telling them to target
UNESCO on their way back.
  It's a jab at Netanyahu's displeasure over the U.N. culture agency's recent recognition of the Palestinians as a
member state.
  Palmor said on Friday that Barkan told UNESCO that Israel has a free press.
