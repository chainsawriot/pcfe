  (17 May 2010)

   Having met in Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran, the undersigned have agreed on the following Declaration:

   1. We reaffirm our commitment to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and in accordance with
the related articles of the NPT, recall the right of all State Parties, including the Islamic Republic of Iran, to develop
research, production and use of nuclear energy (as well as nuclear fuel cycle including enrichment activities) for peaceful
purposes without discrimination.

   2. We express our strong conviction that we have the opportunity now to begin a forward-looking process that will
create a positive, constructive, non-confrontational atmosphere leading to an era of interaction and cooperation.

   3. We believe that the nuclear fuel exchange is instrumental in initiating cooperation in different areas, especially
with regard to peaceful nuclear cooperation including nuclear power plant and research reactors construction.

   4. Based on this point the nuclear fuel exchange is a starting point to begin cooperation and a positive constructive
move forward among nations. Such a move should lead to positive interaction and cooperation in the field of peaceful
nuclear activities replacing and avoiding all kinds of confrontation through refraining from measures, actions and
rhetorical statements that would jeopardize Iran's rights and obligations under the NPT.

  5. Based on the above, in order to facilitate the nuclear cooperation mentioned above, the Islamic Republic of Iran
agrees to deposit 1200 kg LEU in Turkey. While in Turkey this LEU will continue to be the property of Iran. Iran and the
IAEA may station observers to monitor the safekeeping of the LEU in Turkey.

    6. Iran will notify the IAEA in writing through official channels of its agreement with the above within seven days
following the date of this declaration. Upon the positive response of the Vienna Group (US, Russia, France and the IAEA)
further details of the exchange will be elaborated through a written agreement and proper arrangement between Iran
and the Vienna Group that specifically committed themselves to deliver 120 kg of fuel needed for the Tehran Research
Reactor (TRR).

   7. When the Vienna Group declares its commitment to this provision, then both parties would commit themselves to
the implementation of the agreement mentioned in item 6. Islamic Republic of Iran expressed its readiness to deposit its
LEU (1200 kg) within one month. On the basis of the same agreement the Vienna Group should deliver 120 kg fuel
required for TRR in no later than one year.

  8. In case the provisions of this Declaration are not respected Turkey, upon the request of Iran, will return swiftly and
unconditionally Iran's LEU to Iran.
