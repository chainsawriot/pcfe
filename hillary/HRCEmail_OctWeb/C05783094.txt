Subject: Party member urges Greek PM to resign (AP)

ATHENS, Greece - (AP) A senior Greek governing party lawmaker says he will not support the government in
a critical confidence vote unless Prime Minister George Papandreou pledges to resign over the weekend and
start talks on a caretaker government.
   The lawmaker made the comment to The Associated Press hours before the Friday confidence vote, speaking
on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive talks within the governing Socialist party.
   The Socialists have a slim majority of two seats in the 300 member parliament. Papandreou was fighting to
survive a party revolt triggered by his surprise announcement that he would put a European debt deal to a
referendum. He withdrew the proposal in the face of fierce opposition at home and abroad.
