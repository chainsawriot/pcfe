Billâ€”

It has been brought to my attention that I kinda blew it on the Sri Lanka and Armenia statements. I had wrongly assumed
that both were run through you Big Chesses before they got to me. I know now that neither had, and I regret that.

Lesson learned on that one. Won't be repeated.

Best,
DM
