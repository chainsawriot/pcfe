Cameron




[Additional information: according to press reports, the Pakistanis have demanded that we shut Shamsi air base right
away. They have also closed Torkham gate to NATO supply traffic. All senior mil-mil ties (upcoming visits, including
scheduled for tomorrow) have been postponed. More when we have it.]
