Madam Secretary,

A good day in Moscow. Atmospherics in 4 hours of meetings with Medvedev (nearly 2 hours in small setting
with Pres, Gen Jones and me, and 2 hours in bigger group) were positive. We signed solid Afghan agreement,
more positive post-START framework than I would have guessed a few days ago, a useful missile defense
statement including a joint threat assessment on Iran, and agreement on new bilateral commission that you and
Lavrov will lead. President announced that you will visit Moscow in fall to launch process.

Most of small meeting on missile defense and Iran -- candid and thoughtful conversation, with some interesting
openings that I will describe when I can get to other system. Pres firm on Georgia and human rights, but not a
combative discussion.

Tomorrow starts with Putin, then speech and Kremlin lunch, before business and civil society meetings. (I will
stand in for you at Klebnikov memorial service, and also did Human Rights Watch event tonight.)

All best,

Bill

   Thanks for the Update and for all the work you did and led to get us to this
point. I hope you'll have time to send me periodic updates, especially your
impressions of the Medvedev-Putin relationship.

   I am considering a trip to the Caucusus and Central Asia in the Fall, perhaps
attached to the Russia bilat, if we decide that makes sense.

       As you know,                                                                                                1.4(D)

       Travel safely. All the best, Hillary

Madam Secretary,

Just a quick note before leaving for Moscow, Rome and Central Asia.

Moscow preparations are in reasonable shape. Afghan lethal transit agreement is
done, and will be signed on Monday. There's also a broader statement on
cooperation on counter-narcotics and reconstruction in Afghanistan. (Bakiyev
has now signed the Manas agreement, which is a further boost on Afghanistan.)


                                                                     The
Presidents will announce the bilateral commission, and your trip to Russia in
the fall to launch the process with Lavrov. All in all, a good, measured,
realistic step in our effort to rebuild relations --


I'll be in Rome just for the first, "foreign policy" portion of the G8. We're .
working on a Leaders' statement that is likely to look a lot like last week's G8
Foreign Ministers statement on most issues, with an update on North Korea, and
essentially the same, firm line on Iran.

I leave Rome on July 9 with an interagency delegation for stops in Kazakhstan,
Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan, back in DC on July 14.

Hope you had a good Fourth, and all the best,

Bill
