       A couple of things:

           1. The ASSK call sheet is in the front pocket of the binder. This call is tentatively
              scheduled for 9:30 p.m. tonight. Claire will confirm.

           2. There is an action memo in the front pocket of the binder that they are asking you
              approve tonight. Please let me know and we can get the memo to the White
              House.
