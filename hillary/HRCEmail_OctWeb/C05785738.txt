      Nobel Peace Prize Winner Professor Muhammad Yunus' Appeal To The Nation


      Today the hearing for our writ petition was held in the High Court for the ri consecutive
      day. We hope that the Court would examine thoroughly Bangladesh Bank's claim that
      my position as Managing Director is invalid, Despite holding yearly audits by
       Bangladesh Bank, question of legality of Managing Director's position is being raised
      after 12 years. (During these annual audits only once in 1999, Bangladesh Bank raised
      questions, which Grameen Bank responded satisfactorily. After that there were no
       questions raised ever again.)

       Through grassroot election. 9 borrowers are serving as Directors of Grameen Bank
       efficiently. Through them the voices of almost 8 million shareholders are reflected. These
       9 borrowers came all the way from their villages to file their own petition on Thursday,
       placing the hopes and trust of the families of Grameen Bank (of almost 4 Crore people) in
       this honorable court,


       With the permission of Bangladesh Bank, the board of Grameen Bank appointed me as
       the Managing Director, and subsequently unanimously decided that there should be no
       age limit for the Managing Director.


       I have dedicated my entire life in overcoming poverty for the people of Bangladesh. My
       thoughts are for the welfare of the borrowers and employees of Grameen Bank. I have
       always dreamed achanging the lives of the people of Bangladesh. especially of the
       youth,. Grameen Bank will run this legacy for the country and its people. I firmly believe
       that Grameen Rank will continue to work tier the empowerment of women- as it has been
       doing for the last 34 years. To ensure this, there should be a smooth transition of
       management leadership from me to the next Managing Director in a congenial
       environment. i am continuing my effort. And I will continue to advocate for it until I am
