Dear Johnnie--
                                                                                                              â€¢

 Here's all the info I have. Thx so much for following up:

> Thanks again so much for offering to set up a connection between my dad and someone at State about Ghana. Their
Minister of Agriculture apparently just left the Memphis/Wynne area after a 10-day visit, and they want to offer
something in writing for my dad on Monday or Tuesday. The goals seem to be setting up infrastructure for high-volume
farms, rice production, sweet potato production, etc. And, my father facilitating the setup of a model farm, and bringing
in people in agriscience, farmers, etc.

> Now, apparently it.takes many farmers to do the work that a few machines (which the government is saying they want
to buy thousands of secondhand from my father) could do and they want to learn to grow things that their people can
actually eat - as opposed to cocoa and tobacco, which I think are the crops they grow currently.

> My dad went to Ghana a couple of months back, and the water seems to be there. They need electricity to power the
mills and dryers, and he is just curious how he might be received, as a foreign job-killer, or something else not so
pleasant. I don't want him to just take the word of this minister of Ghana. I'd like to know what people think who are
familiar with the workings of the government and the rest of the second and third tier issues that will inevitably come
up.

> So, sorry to go on and on, but I really appreciate your help. Again, his name is Larry Lawson, and he can be reached on
his cellphone -                or at work -
