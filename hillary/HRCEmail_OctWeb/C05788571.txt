Subject: A BIG BIG THANK YOU
Importance: High

Dear Cheryl,
We owe you a very big thanks for your laser focus, time and work - and for the Secretary's hearing Q&A remarks on the
SEC rule.
Her answer was just what we were hoping for. Really great.
Amos â€” thanks to you and your wonderful team for all your efforts.
(and apologies for not sending you this thanks right away!)
Best,
L
