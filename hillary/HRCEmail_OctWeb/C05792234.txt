Ok I will consider. I'm copying Claire so she can quarterback this.

Subject: Art for outer office

As you will remember, we discussed borrowing art from arts in embassies program with beth dozoretz last fall.
We have been talking about options with them and there is a memo coming to you tomorrow with suggestions.
Their staff came to measure so everything you see will fit in office (except for one piece and I asked claire to make a
note of that one for you) Arts in embassies will take care of transporting, installing and insuring. Of course, if you like
none, they can suggest alternatives. Or we just stick with art bank options.
