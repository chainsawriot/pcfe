Ambassador-designate to the U.S., who is scheduled to arrive tomorrow afternoon. As detailed in the emails                 B1
below,
     The Ambassador-designate departed for Washington before the          addressed the immunity issues for
       so the withdrawal of agrement will prevent        from  having diplomatic  immunity once the
Ambassador-designate arrives. Ops is working with the Embassy in        to notify the        MFA now.
            signed the attached withdrawal note.                                                            B5

Folks—

I spoke with                                                                to withdraw agrement. It's not a
done deal yet, and I'll keep you informed as this moves forward.

Thanks for all of your help.

Best, Bill

Dear All – Protocol has just received a call from             at the         Embassy informing us that the
Ambassador-designate is due to arrive the U.S tomorrow at 3:40pm. Post must urgently inform the
MFA that the Ambassador must not travel to the U.S. Protocol is still waiting for a diplomatic note from the
MFA with language that was approved by L last night. Earlier note received from MFA is not
sufficient. Once new dip note is received and reviewed by all appropriate parties a determination would be
made on his travel to WDC.

Rob,

(SBU) Per your request, I am forwarding a copy of the attached diplomatic note that we received today from
the          Foreign Ministry (MFA). The note responds to the demarche that                       and I
delivered yesterday and contains text on waiving diplomatic immunity from that demarche.

(SBU) After our telephone conversation, I called MFA Director for North and Central America             to
explain that we needed a follow-up diplomatic note with the more comprehensive text provided by our Legal
Advisor's office and forwarded to him after delivery of the demarche. I reiterated that the Ambassador-
Designate should not travel to the States until we respond with our concurrence.

Best.

Jim
