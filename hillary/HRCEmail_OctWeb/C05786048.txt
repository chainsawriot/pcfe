Huma:

Attached below and in Word is the ROK call sheet. Nirav Patel circulated this earlier this morning (it may be what Jake
already sent you), but I understand EAP was still waiting for WH clearance on this.

I'll try to touch base with him following 5' conference call to see if there are any updates. If so, I'll re-circulate an
updated version prior to the call.

Thanks,

Dan

Background: The North Korea press reported that KJI died on December 7. North Korea's
state press has referred to KJI's youngest son Kim Jong-un as "great successor" in what appears
to be the first such mention of the heir apparent. President Obama underscored to ROK
President Lee the U.S. commitment to the ROK's security during his midnight December 19
call, and they agreed on the need for close coordination.
