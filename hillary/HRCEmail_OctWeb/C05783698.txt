ANKARA, Turkey - (AP) Eastern Turkey has been shaken by another sharp earthquake in the area where two
recent ones have left 644 people dead.
   The Kandilli observatory says the magnitude 5.2 quake shook the province of Van (vahn). A Turkish news
agency says there are no immediate reports of injuries or damage.
   A local governor says previous quakes, which measured 7.2 and 5.7, have turned the provincial capital of half
a million into a virtual ghost town. He called for urgent relief aid for survivors.
   Those left homeless are dealing with unseasonably cold weather. The Anatolia news agency cited weather
officials as saying Monday that temperatures dipped as low as five degrees Fahrenheit overnight in one town.
