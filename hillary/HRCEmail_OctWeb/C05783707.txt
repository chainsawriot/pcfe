Subject: SFRC Business Meeting Postponed

All â€” SFRC has decided to postpone this week's business meeting until the week of November 28. Last minute requests
to holdover Mike McFaul (Corker), Roberta Jacobson (Rubio) and Aponte (DeMint) forced the Chairman to reschedule. I
am told by SFRC staff that committee members have used their one ability to holdover a nominee and that these should
move forward when the meeting is rescheduled. Dave
