Not particularly noteworthy, given the appointment of a new chief is not as big of a deal in India as it is in Pakistan, but I
thought I flag given S briefly met him. He accompanied Defense Minister Antony for his meeting with S in Sept. 2010.

 Lt Gen Bikram Singh, Army Chief designate.

 Eastern Army Commander Lieutenant General Bikram Singh will be the next Chief of Staff of the 1.3 million-
 strong Indian Army. He will succeed General Vijay Kumar Singh, who retires on May 31.

 The announcement by the Defence Ministry on Saturday came 90 days ahead of the scheduled day of
 assumption of charge — as against the 60-day norm the government has been following. The move removes

uncertainty over the successor following a rash of speculative reports that Gen. Singh could put in his papers
early which could alter the succession plan of the senior-most Army Commander taking over as the next Chief.

The appointment came a day after the incumbent Army Chief said he was not going to resign, effectively
countering speculative reports by some television channels and dailies that Gen. Singh would resign after the
Supreme Court disposed of his petition last month on the controversy over his year of birth.

Lt. Gen. Bikram Singh was commissioned into the Sikh Light Infantry Regiment on March 31, 1972 and during
the last four decades, he has served in a variety of Command and Staff appointments.

Besides having commanded a Corps in the Northern Command, he served as Deputy Force Commander of the
multination U.N. Peace Keeping Mission in Congo. He also served as U.N. observer in Nicaragua and El
Salvador during early 1990s.

Lt. Gen. Bikram Singh has studied with distinction at the Defence Services Staff College, the Army War
College and the U.S. Army War College, Pennsylvania. He also has an M. Phil in Defence Management from
Indore University. He is a recipient of the PVSM, the UYSM, the AVSM, the Sena Medal and the VSM and
was one of the Honorary ADCs to the President of India.
