Subject: The Inauguration of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf

Cheryl,

Warm greetings and best wishes for the new year!

I am truly honored to have an invitation from President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf to attend her inauguration on January 16th.
It will be a very special experience for me as I return to the country where over the course of two years, I did fieldwork
for my Ph.D. in anthropology                                          It would be an extraordinary honor and joy if I am
able to go to President Johnson Sirleaf's inauguration as a member of my country's official delegation.

In speaking with a number of highly respected individuals in the Liberian community here in Washington, I am hearing
what you and I already know. Namely, that given the very special historical and on-going ties between Liberia and the
United States, it is hoped that a very high ranking individual will head the official U.S. delegation. And because during a
Republican administration, First Lady Bush led the delegation to President Johnson Sirleaf's first inauguration, there is a
strong hope that First Lady Obama or Secretary Clinton will lead the delegation to her second inauguration.

Johnnetta
