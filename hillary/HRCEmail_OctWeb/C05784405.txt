Madame Secretary

The Travel Warning applies to all American citizens

But we work, thru Diplomatic Security's Overseas Security Advisory Committee, to the security officers of companies.

These security professionals understand how to mitigate risks, which the average American traveller would not be able
to do

Regards

Pat

PM just asked me if the travel warning applied to companies because if so, they would be hard to recruit tomorrow.
