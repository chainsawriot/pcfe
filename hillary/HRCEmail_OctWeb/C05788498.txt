Cheryl:

Quick thought:

I just wanted your read on whether 'S' would want me to mobilize PEPFAR resources to begin
a process to develop a more robust response to HIV/TB in Burma. It is a country that has not
mapped out its dual epidemics and has depended solely on NGO's (#3) to be their total response
as a result the unmet need is undefined and large. (I did some work for Clinton Foundation in
northern Burma in 2003-2006 that brought 100 kids and 650 adults onto treatment). I am sensitive to
not overwhelm or confound the maturation of the newly forming leadership. Derek Mitchell and I
have met and discussed the potential role PEPFAR could/would play should we decide to engage. I
am in the middle of budget decisions for next year so it would be good to know S's desire.

Erin,

Thanks for this update.

So to confirm, the new proposed dates for the MoH are 4/7-17th?

When will the initial scoping visit/assessment to Burma by Special Rep. Derek Mitchell, Jessica Davey
and team be completed? We are cognizant of the need not to overwhelm or pre-judge the
opportunities for progress, and are looking to the Burma team for some report out before this visit with
the MoH.

We would do all we could to accommodate a meeting with the MoH, when you can advise on
potential dates in DC.

Thanks

Good evening,

As Ambassador Mitchell had mentioned in the meeting a few weeks ago, Burma's Minister of Health is coming to
Washington. He is coming much earlier than expected (we originally thought May) so we will have to work quickly with
JHU to provide a robust program and food for thought for the Minister to take home to Burma.

JHU invited the Minister and controls most of the schedule; however, we would like to have a strong USG component as
well and would like to work with your office in putting together a comprehensive program. I would appreciate your
assistance in identifying key interlocutors, clinics, programs, and ideas to shape the schedule. I think we'd like to focus
the Minister's attention on what is possible for Burma rather than show him fancy, expensive medical equipment that
requires extensive maintenance, training, and 24 hours of electricity to operate.

Ambassador Mitchell is also interested in providing the Minister with "tangibles" if possible, perhaps offers of assistance
(in line with any restrictions we have), capacity building, and training opportunities. We'd like to work with your office
on this idea. In line with this, we plan to coordinate and Burma Health Working Group later in March; we can take our
ideas generated here and discuss them in more detail in the working group.

Thanks so much and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best,

Erin Murphy
Special Assistant
Office of the Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma

Hi Erin,
I hope this email finds you well. As you know, the tentative dates for the Minister's visit are April 7 to April 17. That
certainly does not give us much time. I am in touch with the Minister's point of contact for this trip and am working on
definitively confirming those dates. In the mean time, the first step I am working on is getting draft proposals from each
of the involved parties on what the Minister's activities would be in each city.

In your earlier email to Chris Beyrer, you mentioned hospital visits, engagement with CDC and NIH and meetings with
med students, NGOs and USG officials. Are these activities that your office would arrange? You also mentioned
Boston. Do you have more details on that?

I'm working assiduously to get a well-developed itinerary for the visit as soon as possible. The goal would be to have a
substantive draft itinerary that Amb. Mitchell could take with him during his next trip to the region.

Would you have some time to talk by phone on Thursday or Friday so we can ensure we're all on the same page?

Thanks,
John

Great, thanks everyone.

I don't think we have a confirmed date yet (unless you know differently) but April 7 was thrown around as was May.
From our standpoint- May is better. Regardless, we'll need enough lead time to ensure we have all of the potential visas
and any other issues are sorted out.

Thanks and look forward to working with you all,

Erin

Good afternoon,

We've been on the same emails but I will e-introduce myself- my name is Erin Murphy and I am Ambassador Derek
Mitchell's Special Assistant. Kate (cc'd) and I have been asked by Amb Mitchell to work on a tentative schedule for the
Minister of Health's May visit to the U.S. I would like to reach out to you, as I understand JHU extended the invite, to see
what type of program MU had in mind and if we could help input with ideas of our own. We were thinking of hospital
visits, opportunity to engage with CDC and NIH, meet with medical students, public health NGOs, and USG officials here
in Washington, Baltimore, and if possible, Boston.

Amb Mitchell will be traveling to the region in early March and would like to begin to socialize the Minister's program to
the GOB and also to the USG.

Thanks so much and I look forward to hearing from you.
