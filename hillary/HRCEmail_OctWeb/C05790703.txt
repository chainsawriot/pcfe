Islamabad (Reuters) - Pakistan's prime minister on Friday urged leaders of the Afghan Taliban movement to
enter direct peace negotiations with the Kabul government, in a possible sign that Islamabad is stepping up its
support for reconciliation in the neighbouring country. The prime minister, Yusuf Raza Gilani, said in a
statement that it is his "sincere hope" that the Taliban and other groups respond to his appeal.
