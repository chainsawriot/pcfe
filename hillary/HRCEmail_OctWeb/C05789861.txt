Txpt going to take awhile but he spoke favorably of "Secretary Clinton's speech in Georgetown where she called for

I have no idea what he's referring to!

Santos just quoted me in his speech referring to my Georgetown speech. Not sure from translation what he meant. Pls
start on getting English transcript of his speech.
