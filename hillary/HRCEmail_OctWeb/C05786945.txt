FYI, as we continue our efforts to move communications into the 21st century (note: some might say given it's 2011,
about time!) we are launching new reports to leverage all our assets in new ways to monitor social media --- see below.
If this works we will try it in different regions. Requires cross Bureau collaboration at all levels, clearly a challenge in this
bldg but have to say AF is always a good place to start. FYI, ARS Paris referred to below is an AF resource focused
primarily on francophone Africa.

Bruce, Greta,

As we ramp up activity in the social media sphere surrounding events in Egypt, we have been looking at how to better
monitor social media which as you know is no small challenge.

NEA has a great report coming out in the afternoons, as does IIP.
However, given time zone constraints, we need to find a way to generate an early morning report to give us a sense of
what narratives and news have developed overnight. This is especially true in the realm of social media where rapid
response is of the essence. I believe the best way to do this efficiently and effectively is to leverage all our assets and
expertise in other time zones.

I really like the informal and voluntary piece that Donna Winton has been producing in ARS Paris. I would like to
formalize it - on a temporary basis- with input from key LES in NEA. Donna will be coming to IIP this summer to run social
media, so she will be well-positioned to provide this on a more formal basis then if it proves to be a good model.

With all this in mind I'd like to implement the following steps, on an interim basis, effectively immediately:

- ARS Paris Donna Winton to produce a daily report by 6am EST outlining key trends and themes appearing in NEA
regional social media. Further updates can be done on a voluntary basis as Donna has been doing.

- NEA LES (native speakers) in countries with high usage of social media to provide input to Donna- can be brief and
informal,

- Dubai/London hubs to provide reaction to USAbilAraby as available

- RRU to disseminate the product to its Egypt listserve

Again I want to stress that this report should be brief an informal, a twitter-like report with no need for detailed analysis
or assessments, along the lines of the information Donna is already providing.

Let me know if you have any questions, concerns or thoughts. I would like to see this begin on Friday morning if possible.

Thx.
