•    In the short-term, we are doubling the number of employees at the embassies in Afghanistan and Pakistan -- these
are accommodations and office space not just for STATE but for other agencies like USAID, USDA, DOD;

•     We are working fast in the short run,: we're talking about increasing the number of hooches, and doubling up staff
in lodging. It looks a lot like what you'd see at Bagram or other military facilities in Afghanistan.

•      In•the medium term, we need to improve the security perimeter — acquiring property adjacent to our current
facilities in Kabul, which is now difficult to secure.

•     Long-term, we need embassies in these countries adequate to serve the mission. It's not so long ago our Embassy
in Islamabad was torched, we need a facility which is structurally sound. In Kabul,•we need facilities adequate to size the
mission needed.
