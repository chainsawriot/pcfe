The Embassy Consul General and I gave a 45 minute press conference in French to Haitian media yesterday. There were
12 reporters there. Two FM radio stations carried the whole conference live. We got questions on evacuation, rumours,
TPS, use of American military and reconstruction efforts.

Ambassador Merten will have a press conference for Haitian media today.
he may be joined by the Minister of Health.

Haitian media is a rather grand term at the moment. Radio is working and some internet sites. We are working them
hard. There is no TV and there are no newspapers.

Thanks Ann. This seems to be mostly focused on outreach to US media.

Based on information we got yesterday and my review of the attached report we need significantly more outreach to
radio in Haiti and any other media up and running there. I'd also like a report on our outreach to international media.
