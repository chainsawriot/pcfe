Hi from Ramallah. Spill-over crowd at our Civil Society 2.0 Tech Camp focused on women's empowerment. 100ish
organizations here and 95% of participants are women. Got 13 here from Gaza. Great energy. Solid projects. Exactly
what we hoped for when we created Civil Society 2.0.

S would love it ...
Alec
