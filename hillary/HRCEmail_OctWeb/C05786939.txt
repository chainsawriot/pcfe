Subject: 22 wounded Libyan rebel fighters arrive in Mass. (AP)

BOSTON - (AP)       Nearly two dozen former Libyan rebel fighters have arrived in Massachusetts for treatment
of wounds they suffered in the war that ousted slain leader Moammar Gadhafi.
   The envoy of Libya's National Transitional Council says the 24 fighters who arrived Saturday are the first of
an estimated 200 combatants who will be flown to the U.S. for treatment.
   A senior U.S. State Department official says the fighters were brought to the country following a request to
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during her trip to the Libyan capital of Tripoli last week.
   The wounded fighters were met at Logan International Airport by a senior State Department official and their
country's envoy to the U.S.
   An internationally established fund used by Libya's transitional government says it will pay the fighters'
hospital bills.
