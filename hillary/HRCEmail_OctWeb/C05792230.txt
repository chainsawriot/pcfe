Hi Philippe,

It was great to meet you too and thank you so much for inviting us into the bubble for the day. I really enjoyed talking to
Secretary Clinton- I only wish there had been more time. I would love to take you up on the offer of a briefing, Stateside
or in London, and I think you might interested in some of the details on my two trips inside Syria with the rebels as well.

Let's please stay in touch and talk soon.

All the Best,

Clarissa

P. S. Jake,

Hi Clarissa,

 Was good meeting you today, thank you for meeting us in Turkey. Hope you found the trip down from London
 worthwhile.

 I wanted to make sure you had all of Jake's contact info (below &
 attached) so you can take the Secretary up on her offer to have him brief you whenever you're stateside. Not to
 mention that we get to London every now and again.
