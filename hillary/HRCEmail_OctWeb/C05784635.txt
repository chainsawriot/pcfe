Hillary Clinton's 3-step guide to sartorial diplomacy

December 2, 2011 5:02 pm by Vanessa Friedman



Hillary Clinton's historic trip to Burma, which began on Wednesday and ends today, was an example
of many things, from Obama-era outreach to realpolitik, but as far as I am concerned, it was also a
primer on effective sartorial diplomacy. What lessons can we learn?

1. Don't under-estimate the colour of rapprochement.

When offering the olive branch of official recognition, shades make a difference — and by shades I
don't mean Vladimir Putin's ever-present sunglasses, but the shades of the rainbow: specifically the
blue shades of the rainbow, universally signifying peace, calm, and dependability (true blue).

If in doubt, simply consider the fact that not only did Mrs Clinton don head-to-toe blue for her initial
meeting with President Thein Sein, but she later wore a similar, even calmer version of the jacket/top
combo for her official sit-down with Aung San Suu Kyi — while her hosts themselves likewise adopted
tonal variations of the same, from navy to teal. As to the canniness of the choice, simply note the

resulting vision of uniform harmony and serenity. When the Secretary of State has gone home and
her words of friendship and support have faded from memory, the pictures will still remain: reminders
of 1) American diplomacy and 2) the ability for two distinct styles (native Burmese, US power suits) to
work together.

As a tactic, it's significantly smarter than the attempt by Western politicians to "go native" when they
go on foreign diplomatic missions.

2. Study the wardrobe of your hostess

When dining with Aung San Suu Kyi the night before their official summit, Mrs Clinton seemed to
have adopted almost wholesale her hostess's style, with a white Nehru jacket, black bottoms and her
hair pulled back in a similar low ponytail, secured by a jeweled band to mimic Aung San Suu Kyi's
flowers. Indeed, from the outside, they look like sorority sisters, and the message of solidarity is
conveyed without a word.

3. Pack efficiently.

Look again at these pictures: Mrs Clinton wore, it appears, the same trousers three out of the four
days: to deplane, with her blue jacket, and with her cream jacket (it's hard to tell, below, because they
blend in with the plane steps). That's packing lightly! It also communicates for those back home that
1) Mrs Clinton, who was known when she was First Lady for faffing about with her hair, no longer
wastes time worrying about fashion and 2) Mrs Clinton is aware these are difficult times, and is
economic in her clothes buying and not afraid to wear the same thing multiple days in a row.

So, to sum up: three days, four outfits, two messages, one for those at home, and one for those
abroad. Spinmeisters everywhere should be impressed.
