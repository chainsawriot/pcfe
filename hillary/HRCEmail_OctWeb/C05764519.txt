Qaddafi Visit to UNGA

      •    Mike PoIt noted that Congressman Rothman and Senator Lautenberg have been raising the issue of where
           Qaddafi will stay during UNGA, especially whether he would be outside the 25-mile radius. The subsequent
           discussion touched upon the fact that the Libyans are no longer subject to the 25-mile limit, though we could
           impose it. Cheryl said that the Secretary believes we need to put this issue to rest right away, lest it continue to
           fester. P noted that Jeff Feltman has reached out to the Libyan FM to suggest that Qaddafi should remain in
           New York City. (More about that below).

      •    Jim noted he had attended a meeting on Chinese tire imports yesterday Participants for the most mit agrperi

Honduras

      •    Harold said that the action memo calling for a cut-off in assistance to Honduras would be coming to the
           Secretary soon. Cheryl confirmed with him that it would not be coming forward in the next few days. Jim
           stressed that he thought we needed to think more about the end-game in Honduras, where the reports from
           the delegation of foreign ministers is not encouraging. Is there a scenario under which they do not accept
           Zelaya back but we recognize the legitimacy of the elections? If so, what conditions would have to be met? If
           not, should we not signal that now in order to maximize our leverage? Cheryl noted that Jim had not been part

          of the Secretary's meeting on this issue where she had also focused on the end-game. She subsequently tasked
          WHA and S/P with a revised options memo laying out all the various scenarios with respect to the elections.

   •      In the subsequent                   WHA noted that they were looking at possible visa sanctions against the de       B5
          facto regime and its supporters.

SOUTHCOM Visit to Nicaragua

   •      Jim asked WHA about the current SOUTHCOM visit to Nicaragua. WHA said that they thought it was fine —
          Nicaraguans actually want to cooperate more on counter-narcotics and humanitarian issues.

Libya

   •      Jeff reported on his conversation with the Libyan FM, who assured Jeff that the Libyans would not feature al-
          Megrahi at the September 1 anniversary celebration, and that he understood the sensitivities about Qaddafi's
          travel and the need to stay in New York City. Jim raised the issue of whether we attend the September 1
          celebration at all in light of the reception given al-Megrahi, suggesting perhaps no one from our embassy should
          go. Jeff demurred, noting that we need to continue to cultivate more moderate forces and that we have other
          important equities at stake,                                                                                     1.4(E)

H1N1

   •      Maria Otero said that there would be                           on H1N1 later this week, with particular focus        B5
          on whether we would provide any of the vaccine to other countries and, if so, how much and who pays.
