Cheryl & Lona,

We now have a slate of finalists for the new Fulbright Public Policy Fellowship (that will be renamed Clinton-Fulbright
Fellows) and I'd like to schedule a time for the fellows' pre-departure orientation in Washington so that the Secretary
could come speak to the group briefly before they ship out. The short list (including the fellows for Haiti) is attached.

We can schedule the pre-departure orientation for ANY TIME in July or August. Is there some day/week that we know S
will be around that we could get on her calendar?

Many thanks,
Meghann
