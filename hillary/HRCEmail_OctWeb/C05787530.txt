You should have the call sheets soon, if not already. (laura sent them to huma).
Because of the time difference, it may be early morning before we have confirmation on these 2 calls. III be sure to let
you know as soon as we have confirmation.
Also, we've been unable to lock in Iavrov and al-faisal. Will keep you posted on any developments there, too (although it
seems unlikely for tomorrow morning).
