The Rev Ian Paisley, the former Northern Ireland First Minister and leader of the Free Presbyterian Church,
has been admitted to hospital.

He was rushed to the Ulster Hospital, Dundonald, on the outskirts of east Belfast, yesterday. Unconfirmed
reports claimed he suffered a heart attack.

Mr Paisley, 85, a former MP for north Antrim, was leader of the Democratic Unionist Party for almost 40
years and late last month preached his final sermon in Belfast after standing down as moderator of the
Free Presbyterian Church.

He had started work on his autobiography.

Mr Paisley's wife Baroness Paisley confirmed her husband was being treated in the Ulster Hospital.

A statement said: "She requests that the family's privacy be respected at this difficult time."
