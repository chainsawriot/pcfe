Subject: Suu Kyi to run in upcoming Myanmar by-election (Reuters)

YANGON, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Myanmar democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi will run in an upcoming by-
election, a senior official in her party said on Monday, three days after her National League for Democracy
ended its boycott of the country's political system.

   It will be the first time the Nobel Peace Prize laureate has competed in an election since 1990, when her
landslide electoral victory was voided by generals intent on maintaining power.

   "Aung San Suu Kyi intends to stand for the by-election but it's a bit early to say from which constituency she
will run," Nyan Win, a senior official in her party, told Reuters.

   Suu Kyi, the daughter of late independence hero Aung San and a staunch opponent of the military dictators,
spent 15 of the previous 21 years in detention before her release from house arrest a year ago.
