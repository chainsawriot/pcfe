Didn't share the article, and didn't even mean to have an attachment so maybe the original email praising you
and us for our responsiveness "disappeared." Main "news" is I read the gripping story of Project Rebirth in the
arts section of the Times this am, and I had a flashback of being visited at Russell about it, and sure enough
when I emailed the visitor, he confirmed he was the one and praised us to the hilt! Xoxo

I couldn't open the attachment so not sure what this refers to. Where in the Times today is the article?

For Senate Archives,   I was the one to meet with the starters of "Project Rebirth" that is written up today in the
Times and elsewhere and sounds truly gripping. This Manus Cooney, of all things, was Hatch's judiciary lead,
and well, off the record,
                                  Some little birdie told me in my 'rain t at it was e w o came in to to us
about the planned   documentary,  and  lo and behold, that form of the "tweet" was right!! Best to all. Xoxo

Tamera â€”

Wow. What a memory. Yes. I was involved back then. Was helping a guy named Steve Mendelson who was serving as
the Exec. Dir. The organization was trying to get some legitimacy with policymakers. They weren't a client but a friend
of mine was on the Board. My aim was to help get them in front of policymakers in DC who cared and who could help
give their effort some credibility. You and Secretary Clinton were GREAT. You really helped them get traction and
legitimacy. Wish I could say the same about the Bush Administration.

How are you doing these days? Hope all is well on your end. Happy to be getting an email from you. Attached and
printed below is my contact info. I am partnered with Shawn Smeallie, Sheryl Cohen, and David Urban over at
ACG. Good people.

Take care,

Manus.

but in case it is, am I off my rocker or remembering correctly that you were part of Project Rebirth, the result that I just
read about in the Times??
