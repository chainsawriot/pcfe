Hi H--

Re this morning's Mike Allen headline, below--

:-)

The Yiddish word, most often used by Jewish mothers when their daughter is walking down the aisle for the hand-off to
a "nice young man," is "naches." It is something between pleasure, pride, and relief.

So I read the following, and will soon read the article, and feel "naches."

Your friend,

Lanny

(And thanks again for                   working for me this summer - a young man who admires you as does
               He is truly very special. )




â€” David Rothkopf, on ForeignPolicy.com, "American political leadership at work ... far from the beltway": A "politician
has been on the other side of the world ... advancing American interests and the policies of the president with
meaningful results and exceptional skill. That politician is Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is just completing an
around-the-world mission that has taken her from the economic frontlines of the eurozone crisis to the markets of
tomorrow in Asia. The trip, obscured in the noise around the debt ceiling debate, has been a real triumph for the Obama
administration and has revealed that many of its policies over the past two years are now bearing significant fruit."
