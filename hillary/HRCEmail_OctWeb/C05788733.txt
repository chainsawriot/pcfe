Cheryl — NEA is working on a response for you, but a little update in advance. We received a cable from
Baghdad yesterday detailing the MEK decision to let Ashrafis move forward with individual applications. Most
of the 'modest numbers' accepted by European countries, which T cites below, are likely the remaining
European passport holders, although NEA believes that Italy is accepting 6-12 ill residents (who have no
passport connection to Italy). Once the individual applications are filed, the camp residents move from "people
of concern" to "protected," which has international meaning and buys time for comprehensive plan to resettle
the residents. Finally, by all accounts, Lindwall has been a breath of fresh air.

Cheryl

Just to let u know that David has made a tremendous impression on the people of
Camp Ashraf. Although the situation remains dangerous and there's fear of
another Iraqi raid, there's also real progress.

Carolyn Ennis of UNHCR has started to register residents as "People of Concern"
and each of the residents is completing an individual application. Residents
have started to be relocated, in modest numbers, to Italy, Australia,   .
Switzerland and the Netherlands. There's a significant chance that Canada may
accept additional people, including their own passport holders, in the near future. The hope is

that this will create a pipeline to allow a larger exodus if the US FTO is
lifted.

Both the EU and the UNHCR have used this progress to argue that closing Ashraf
by January 1 is "unrealistic" and the relocation/registration progress are
addressing Malaki's concerns. The immediate problem is to get the UNHCR the logistical
help that they need and get some personnel in the Camp to make another attack difficult.

I've continued my consultation with Mr Desrocher at State and I hope to see him again next week.
I know that this is enormously complex but everybody has been cooperative and I believe that we're
making progress.

Welcome back! Hope that u had a good vacation.
