The following are speeches I want to give if possible in the next 18 months:

Islamic Center at Oxford--the Kuwaiti FM has asked me every time we talk and I would like to do it but we'd have to
coordinate w a trip to Europe and the FM's schedule.

Clinton school/library in Ark:
I've been asked to come to Ark as part of their ongoing Speaker's series and altho I have no specific time in mind, I'd like
to do it before 2013.

VMI: I'd still like to do this if we can ever get a date--lets try for early next year

CAP--Neera has asked me to speak at a conference CAP is doing in the Fall in DC. Her preferred date is Oct 12--can I do
that?

Econ speech--I have no idea when it will be ready and where I will give it but will do so
