I defer to Huma on Copenhagen and Lisa.
We do have a draft letter ready for Dave's service.

Can we get Lisa's lunch rescheduled to before or after? And I'd have to do a letter for Dave's service. What are the
logisitics? Are there rooms for us if we take a smaller group?

Thursday and Friday are very light -- essentially you would miss Lisa Caputo's lunch, Dave Stone's service on Thursday
Nothing on Friday.
As for Wednesday, they are scheduling a PC from 5-6:30pm (at least we have been told to hold that time). That is the
last item on your schedule that day.

What happens to my schedule if I have to go to Copenhagen, probably Wed-Fri?
