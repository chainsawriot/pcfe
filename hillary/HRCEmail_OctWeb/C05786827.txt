Wow--that's high praise indeed since he knows everybody.

How are you? Are you on a longer trip or just back and forth to Singapore? I'm off Thursday for nearly two weeks to
Turkey, Greece, India, Indonesia and Hong Kong. Hope we can catch up in person sometime. Until then, Happy Summer
to you and your family.

Subject: Lee Kwan Yew praise for WJC

I'm in Singapore for a forum on FutureChina and am listening to John Thornton interview to Lee Kwan Yew. Someone
from the audience asked him who the greatest leaders were that he had met in his career, and he answered Deng Xiao
Ping, Helmut Schmidt, and WJC. Nice company!

Congrats on the Mexican truck deal! And making sure the flo/flytilla didn't turn into a disaster.
