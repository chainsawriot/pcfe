Subject: Arabs to end Syria mission, seek UN force - draft (Reuters)

CAIRO (Reuters) - Arab states will end an Arab observer mission to Syria and call on the U.N. Security
Council to send an international peacekeeping force to end violence there, according to a draft resolution
obtained by Reuters on Sunday.

   They will also call for tighter implementation of economic sanctions on Damascus that Arabs imposed late
last year, according to the draft being discussed by ministers meeting in Cairo. The draft calls for a halt to "all
forms of diplomatic cooperation" with Syria.
