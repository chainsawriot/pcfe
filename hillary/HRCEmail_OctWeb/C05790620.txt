Subject: Cui meeting

Session at Naval Academy is going well. Chinese confirmed May 2-5 in Beijing for S and ED. They don't want this
announced yet but this looks settled. They are also leaning toward SSD on the day before. Also Donilon holding a dinner
with Dai in Korea during nuclear summit. Bill should attend. Cui welcomed Bill to Beijing after nuclear summit but also
warned that Hu was going to India during that time so Dai would not be in Beijing. I think the message is for us to
reconsider dates. More later Kurt
