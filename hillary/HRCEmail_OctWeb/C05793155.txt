Abbas asked, as we know from DR's readout, but I don't know if this story
about the Israeli response is accurate. Checking with posts. Given late
hour there may not have clearer picture till morning.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided on Monday to return 100 bodies of Palestinian
terrorists buried in Israel to the Palestinian Authority.

According to an Israeli official, Netanyahu agreed to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas request to
transfer the bodies. "We are hoping that this step will increase faith and help foster a renewal of the
political process with the Palestinians," said the official.

Saturday night, Netanyahu's special envoy, lawyer Isaac Molho, arrived in Ramallah and met with
Abbas. Molho passed on a letter to the Palestinian Authority president, regarding a renewal of the
political proves. During the discussion that followed, Abbas expressed three requests, that Israel
show flexibility and bring about the end of the Palestinian prisoner's hunger strike, the transfer of
Palestinian bodies buried in Israel, and the release of Palestinian prisoners held since before the Oslo
Agreements.

The Israeli official noted that Molho updated Netanyahu as to Abbas' requests, and the Prime Minister
decided to transfer 100 bodies of terrorists, as a show of faith to the Palestinian Authority, that
could possibly speed up the renewal of talks between the two sides. "The Palestinians were informed
of the transfer of bodies and responded very positively," said the senior official. "At this point there is
no decision to release Palestinian prisoners;" he added.

Israel had previously agreed to transfer the bodies to the Palestinian Authority in July 2011, however
Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak changed their minds at the last minute, because of
pressure from families of terror victims, and fear that the transfer could harm the deal in progress to
release Gilad Shalit.
