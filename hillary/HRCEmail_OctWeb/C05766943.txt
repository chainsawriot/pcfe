A riposte from Tom Ricks, reliable mouthpiece of Petraeus et al, assailing Biden, surrogate for Obama, with a
leak that Biden sleeps through briefings and an appeal to McDonough et al to shut up Biden (and by implication
shut up the president). Nice. Cheers, Sid

Just how wrong can Joe Biden be?
Posted By Thqmas E. Rcksl OVIonday, December 28, 2009

The estimable Rally Chandrasekaran points out that VP Biden recently said on MSNBC's Morning Joe, on Tues. Dec. 15,
about the American approach in Afghanistan that, "This is not a COIN strategy."
This is going to be a surprise to General McChrystal, who thinks it is.
'Alhat a hot tranny_niess! The fact of the matter is that, pretty much as usual, Biden doesn't know what he is talking about.
He has some vague notion of counterinsurgency as a massive, nation-wide effort. But word on the street is that he has
been dozing during the briefings: In fact, McChrystal and his boss, the once-prominent Gen. David Petraeus, have
explicitly said that the revamped approach is focused on only about 40 percent of Afghanistan, and that even within that
area, outlying areas won't be handled in a troop-intensive, classic counterinsurgency manner, but rather with focused
counter-terror raids.
Request to NSC: Will someone over there have the VP and his posse get a brief on counterinsurgency from the Special
Operators on the Joint Staff before he shoots off his mouth again? I mean, do him a favor.
Long-term benefit: I have loag been struck at how consistently good Joe Biden and John Kerry have been as
counterindicators of what their party, and their nation, should do. Age doesn't always bring wisdom -- sometimes it just
brings seniority.
