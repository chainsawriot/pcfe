Zhwandoon TV ran the entire interview by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the head of HIG, taped exclusively by Pajhwok News
Agency. The interview called President Karzai's government a U.S. puppet government without any sovereignty or

States, saying that if signed it will be an agreement signed between the United States and a U.S. Embassy FSN.
