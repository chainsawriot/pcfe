Subject: Germany "very concerned" about IAEA report on Iran (Reuters)



TUNIS (Reuters) - Germany is very concerned about a new International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report
saying Iran was stepping up its uranium enrichment drive, German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said
Feb. 24.

"Germany is very concerned about the latest report from the IAEA. We think Iran should understand the key to
ending sanctions is in their own hands, they have a duty to cooperate with the international community,"
Westerwelle told reporters on the sidelines of an international meeting on Syria.
