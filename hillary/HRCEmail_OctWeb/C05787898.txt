Dear Barney:

I am desperate for a face-to-face meeting with Secretary Clinton. The situation is becoming increasingly
ominous and I don't feel anyone else can truly help or will help with the same level of concern. I am not asking
for public statements or anything along those lines. Can you help me?                 life is in increasing danger
because of unfolding events in Pakistan.

Many thanks and love,
