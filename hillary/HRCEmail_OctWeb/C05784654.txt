Subject: S Appropriations Calls

Jake, Alice — Just wanted to flag for you both 2 calls Tom and I would like S to make either later today or tomorrow on
our appropriations bill.                                                                                 We are sending    B5
forward a slightly amended version which adds a bullet                             on getting relief from the two laws
that prohibit our contributions to UN agencies if the Palestinians pursue membership as a state.

                                                                        According to Appropriations Committee staff,
Ros-Lehtinen has objected to raising the cap on Contributions to International Peacekeeping Activities. For the past two
years our appropriations bill has carried a cap of 27.2% for assessed contributions.             wants the level to
revert to 25% which is the level in the underlying authorization.



Call sheets should be headed your way shortly. Thanks. Dave
