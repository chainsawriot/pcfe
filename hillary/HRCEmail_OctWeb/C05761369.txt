Cheryl and Robert,

I want to apologize for having missed lunch today. On the way out the door general jones called a meeting in
preparation for the chiefs meeting.

I regret missing it, and hope to see you both soon.

Meanwhile, we'll do another check in internally tomorrow in terms of where we are on the target date. I will shoot you
both a note shortly thereafter.

Below are the points that robert and ben used to read out the meeting this evening.

Happy Halloween,
Denis.
