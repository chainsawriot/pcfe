Thus far, we know that HH arrived Ibad early on Sunday am; that Munter spoke with Z and P and others an Sat; that the
US angle has thus far not played a major role in the media coverage; that names of potential successors to HH (including
Bashir) are circulating, etc. There are reports that he met today, and that there will be more formal meetings with Z on
Monday. HH says he is ready for full probe.
