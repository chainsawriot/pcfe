Insulza just called with the following:
- Zelaya just gave a press conference and announced:
- CFK, Lugo, Correa AND Insulza are travelling to San Salvador
- Z in a separate plane, accompanied by Rodas and D'escoto, will attempt to go to Tegu and when unsuccessful will then
meet the others in San Salvador
- they are leaving very shortly
- Z claims that the Presidents' trip with Insulza is a diplomatic initiative to encourage dialogue.
I told Insulza that he should not go and that neither the GA nor PC gave him the mandate for this trip. He says since
they're not going to Tegu it's a dip initiative.
Frankly, if they know now Tegu is closed, they do not have to go to ES to say so. They can do so from DC. He insists on
going and claims that he dissuaded them from going to Honduras.
Insulza hopes this will help facilitate a favorable reponse from Mitcheletti to agree to dialogue.

Flores just called me. As you all know, he has come out in favor of de factos. Is currently in Washington. Roberto said he
has spoken to Ramdin to pass along a proposal from Micheletti that the Supreme Coin and legislature appoint reps for a
dialogue with the OAS; that OAS reps should be working level (i.e. not Insulza) and include reps of willing member states.
M wondered if US would participate. Roberto is hoping to hear back from Ramdin so that this could be announced asap
by SC, leg and, presumably, OAS. ck
