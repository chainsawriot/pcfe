Subject: Palestinian inmates begin leaving Israeli jails (Reuters)

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Vehicles carrying Palestinian prisoners began departing from jails in Israel on
Tuesday, a Reuters witness said, setting in motion a phased prisoner exchange that is meant to secure the release
of abducted Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit.

   In the deal reached between Israel and the Gaza Strip's Islamist rulers Hamas, Shalit will be freed after five
years of captivity in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Its implementation is expected to take
several hours.

   The first vehicles that left a jail in central Israel were carrying female prisoners, most to be freed in the West
Bank. They were accompanied by security personnel from Egypt, who mediated the swap deal, an official
said.
