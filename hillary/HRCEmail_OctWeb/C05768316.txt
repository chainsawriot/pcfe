Subject:                            Recognition of USG assistance efforts



Sean and Maura:

As you may have heard from Raj, (and Maura, as I think I mentioned to you when we met at dinner last week) we are
organizing a small group to kick off our efforts to find ways to increase global awareness of USG assistance efforts. By
copy of this email I am introducing you to my Chief of Staff, Kitty Di Martino who will help to organize the effort on our
end.

Raj, Anne Marie Slaughter and I will co-chair the meeting. The plan is to have an in-house meeting first and then to
follow up with a meeting which will include non-government experts to help advise us as we move forward.

This is a high priority for all of us and for Secretary Clinton. I know scheduling is always a challenge but I'd like to see if
we can figure out a time which works for all of us as soon as possible.

In terms of invitees I would suggest the following people from DOS:

Anne Marie Slaughter
Cheryl Mills
Jake Sullivan
Maria Otero
Melanne Verveer
Bob Hormats

I'm sure others at State will have some more names to include but I think we should try to keep the group as small as
possible. Let us know who else you think we should include from your end.

Thanks.

JM
