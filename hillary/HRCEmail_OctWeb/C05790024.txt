Subject: Cuba: Freed agent on island to visit brother (AP)


HAVANA (AP) - Cuba says an agent serving probation in the United States after a long prison stay has
returned to the island for a two-week visit to see his ailing brother.
   An official note read on Cuban state television says Rene Gonzalez arrived around noon Friday.
   It reiterated that he still intends to return to the U.S. within the two-week window granted him in a March 19
ruling.
   U.S. District Judge Joan Lenard allowed Gonzalez to make the trip.
   The Justice Department objected to the visit, saying he might have contact with Cuban intelligence agents
and get new covert tasks to perform once he returned to the U.S.
   Gonzalez is one of the "Cuban Five" agents sentenced to prison in the United States.
