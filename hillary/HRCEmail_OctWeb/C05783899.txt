All,

Below are the results of the 2nd round:

African Group (1 seat available)
    • Mauritania 72
    • Togo 119

Eastern European Group (1 seat available)
    • Azerbaijan 90
       •    Slovenia 97

Bottom line: results inconclusive. Since none received the required two-thirds vote of members present, voting and
submitting valid ballots (which is varying in each vote), the General Assembly is immediately proceeding to a third round
of voting. The third round is again restricted to the above countries.

If the third round is inconclusive, the fourth round (and 5th and 6th) will be an "unrestricted" round, whereby votes may
be cast for any eligible Member from the respective regions, including those that were part of the first round but not
part of 2nd or 3rd rounds, i.e. Hungary could get some votes.

Voting for third round has occurred, ballots are being collected, and the General Assembly will soon be in recess again to
count the votes.

Dan
