MS -

To follow up on our conversation the other day about doing something webby related to Egypt, we'd like to on Monday
set up a session where you answer questions that have been culled through new media (youtube, Twitter, etc). We'd
partner with Aljazeera who would solicit, choose and pose the questions to you.
