Cheryl, I would very much appreciate your forwarding this to the President and the Secretary on the assumption they
would like to hear how terrific their daughter is. Chelsea chaired a panel that discussed the Holocaust education movie
that Linda Mills and Peter Goodridge made at a program sponsored in part by NYU. Chelsea was knowledgable, erudite,
articulate and very personable. Susan and I were very impressed, as were the entire audience. Best regards, Marty.
