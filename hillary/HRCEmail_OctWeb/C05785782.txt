Subject: Shepherds hotel statement

Team is proposing it go out in your name. I think Mitchell's could work, altho you being here might make it advisable for
you to speak to it.

We are very concerned about the initiation of demolition of the Shepherd's Hotel in East Jerusalem. This
disturbing development undermines peace efforts to achieve the two state-solution. In particular, this move
contradicts the logic of a reasonable and necessary agreement between the parties on the status of Jerusalem. We
believe that through good faith negotiations, the parties must mutually agree on an outcome that realizes the
aspirations of both parties for Jerusalem, and safeguards its status for people around the world. Ultimately, the lack of a
resolution to this conflict harms Israel, harms the Palestinians, and harms the U.S. and the international community. We
will continue to press ahead with the parties to resolve the core issues, including Jerusalem, in the context of a peace
agreement.
