Subject: My little brother Andy's students



My little brother Andy is                                                          is
bringing 40-odd students to DC next week. I'm going to take them around the State
Department Tuesday afternoon - I was hoping to impose on you for like 15 minutes to take a
few questions from them. We'd assemble them in the Treaty Room. If you're amenable,
Lona says she can figure it out....
