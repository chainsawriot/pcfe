Dear Hillary,

The State Department Awards ceremony on International Women's Day was incredibly inspiring. What a
privilege to attend! You're doing an impossible job incredibly well. I understand that Elizabeth Littlefield will
be on your trip this week -- she is very, very worth engaging, and she'll have insights re Yunus situation too
from her former role heading C-Gap. I'm very glad she gets to spend some time with you.




I'd love to see you when it next may be possible and I meanwhile pray for your safe travels and that all the
challenges you juggle are leavened with time to breath and laugh. Please know how many of us are wishing
you well.

Jan
