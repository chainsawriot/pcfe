Subject: CUOMO'S 'GRETA GARBO' STRATEGY


CUOMO'S 'GRETA GARBO' STRATEGY-- Dylan Byers: 'Andrew Cuomo is planning to make a bid for
the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. Yet for the second year in a row, Cuomo declined to attend the
National Governors Association winter meeting this weekend in Washington, typically a must-attend event for
aspiring governors. ... In the 420-some days that he has been in the Statehouse, Cuomo hasn't done a single
interview with any of the national television networks, despite more than a dozen requests from Sunday
morning shows. ... [T]hat puts him in stark contrast to other heavily discussed 2016 contenders, most notably
Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, a ubiquitous media presence ...

"[I]nsiders in New York say Cuomo's low profile is part of a tightly controlled media operation geared toward
ensuring a strong showing in 2016. By avoiding the national spotlight now, they say, Cuomo can craft his own
narrative as an able governor -- outgrowing his reputation as a brash political tactician ... 'Here you have a
Democratic governor whose general position in life is, 'If I do a good job, they will find me,"' Democratic
strategist Hank Sheinkopf explained. 'He's the guy who's running the game and the Washington media is finding
him. ... The strategy is do a good job at home, make headlines doing your work in the world's media capital and
they will come looking for you ... And it's working because people are talking about what he's doing."
