Please pass on to S

Dear Madam Secretary,

I am presently in Athens on a whirlwind trip to Brussels, Rome, Athens and Ankara. I did want to let you know that I
received a call a short while ago from Bulgarian Foreign Minister Mladenov to say that Bulgaria had just announced its
decision to cancel the Belene nuclear project with Russia. This was a major topic of discussion during your visit to Sofia.
He said that Russia is being cooperative. Bulgaria will take possession of the one reactor that has been completed and
will transfer it to the Kozloduy site. Westinghouse is talking to the Bulgarians about doing a project at Kozloduy using the
Russian reactor.

Best,
Dick
