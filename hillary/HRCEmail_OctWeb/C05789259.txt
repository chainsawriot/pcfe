Dear Secretary Clinton,

Happy Memorial Day! So many veterans must be thrilled to celebrate the holiday knowing that OBL is no longer hatching
plots.

I thought the speech was impressive. The beginning â€” where he thanked you for your tireless efforts -- was a high point,
and he deserves credit for identifying the United States as being on the right side of history in a region where so many
autocrats are on the wrong side of it. The section with the line about the obsolescence of "strategies of repression and
strategies of diversion" was powerful.

Beyond what could be addressed on that occasion, I can't help being wary of the fact that the region remains a place
where states are interpenetrated and outside powers have consistently intervened.
Turkey is in a very interesting position vis-a-vis Syria, even as Iran and Saudi Arabia compete for influence there; I would
not be surprised ifChina were working behind the scenes both to shore up Qaddafi and to cultivate good ties with a
range of possible successors; etc. Given these dynamics, in a future address, it might be appropriate to go into further
detail in laying out our principles for resolving regional rivalries and disputes -- like you did in the South China Sea
context. I also can't help thinking about how the Middle East might look if Iraq realizes its potential as a major energy
producer.

Thank you again! All best, Jackie

ps It was my tenth college reunion over the weekend, and Jen and Johann and Aksel were staying with us, so Jen told the
story of how Johann confronted you with the world's primary challenge, the bane of Norway.
