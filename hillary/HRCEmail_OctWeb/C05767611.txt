Not to be too neurotic about this but want to be sure you got my response about the meetings in Tampa yesterday. If
not I will resend.

No, I haven't. I just did a search and have nothing from you before today. Did it appear on you email that they went thru
to me?

Just curious whether you received the emails I sent to you over the past 2 months, re; pakistan, doug holloway, etc.
Nothing urgent they were informational only but I am concerned our emails may be hitting some tech glitch.

Judith--Did you ever receive the email below? There were a few questions I wanted to bring to your attention.

How was your mtg w Petraus? I'd love to get a readout before I leave for 10 days on Monday. Thx, H

 Happy New Year to you and your family and thank you for making this journey w me. I'm looking forward to the work
ahead in 2010.

 A few odds and endsâ€”

  Have you heard of the Ben Franklin awards for public diplomacy? I saw a reference to them and don't know what they
are.

 Have you connected w Georgetown Prof and former Amb Cynthia Schneider? She has written and worked on cultural
engagement in the Muslim world and wants to help.

                                                                                                             ' If so,
when would you be ready to do it?

 All the best--H
