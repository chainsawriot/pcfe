Subject: Turks say Syrians open fire near border (Reuters)



AMMAN (Reuters) - Syrian troops on the Turkish border opened fire in sustained bursts on Wednesday,
residents of Turkish villages close to the frontier said, a day after Syrian authorities said they had repelled an
armed incursion from Turkey.

   Rebel soldiers said their Free Syrian Army, some of whose officers are based in Turkey, had clashed on
Tuesday with Syrian government troops near the Turkish frontier, but they denied their forces had moved into
Syria from Turkey, whose government has denounced its former ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

    "We heard heavy gunfire," Abu Fand, a villager in the Turkish border village of Guvecci, told Reuters by
telephone, adding that it came from the Syrian side of the frontier. "The rattle and sounds were heard until early
dawn."

   Another man in the village, Abu Yousef, said he saw firing coming from Syrian army positions and believed
they had been aiming at people trying to cross the border: "The Syrians were firing close to the border from
sniper posts on the hillside."
