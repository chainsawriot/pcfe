MEMORANDUM

September 13, 2009




TO:              Cheryl Mills




FROM:            Jake Sullivan




SUBJECT:        Rebuilding the International Consensus for a Strong Nonproliferation
Regime




Pursuant to our discussion, I have consulted with Bob Einhorn and Ellen Tauscher in preparing this memorandum, which
outlines the role that the Secretary and the Department must play to successfully achieve the President's
nonproliferation agenda.

Promoting the President's agenda for reducing nuclear threats worldwide is clearly a USG-wide effort.

[1] If you look at the President's campaign pledges, nearly all of them are diplomatic undertakings, e.g.:

      Loose Nukes: Secure all loose nuclear materials around the world in four years;

      Reductions in Stockpile: Negotiate dramatic reductions in the stockpiles of U.S./Russian weapons and material;

      Fissile Ban: Seek a global ban on the production of fissile material for weapons;

      NPT: Strengthen NPT so that nations that don't comply automatically face strong sanctions; and,

•     Fuel Bank: Create an international fuel bank to back up commercial supplies to remove excuses for nations like
Iran that are building enrichment plants.
