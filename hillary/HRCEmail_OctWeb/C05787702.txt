Sir, it was in the attachment:

President Karzai:

[Initial conversation in Urdu.]
Karzai: God forbid, if anytime there is a war between Pakistan and the US,
we will stand with Pakistan.

Geo TV: With Pakistan?

Karzai: Yes, sure. We are your brothers, just like Pakistan gave us
shelter, just like Pakistan thought us brother, and as refugees we lived
there with respect. Like this, if there is any...

Geo TV: you made a very big comment. What if there is a war between
Pakistan and India? If Pakistan is attacked, if Pakistan is attacked, and

if the people of Pakistan needs Afghanistan's help, Afghanistan will be
there with you.


[Continued in English.] If Pakistan is attacked and if the people of
Pakistan need Afghanistan's help, Afghanistan will be there with you.
Afghanistan is a brother. Against all that the Pakistani establishment has
done to Afghanistan, Afghanistan is still a brother. Afghanistan will
never forget, will never forget the welcome, the hospitality, the respect
and the brotherhood showed by the Pakistani people towards the Afghan
people. We were five million refugees there. We will never forget.
Anybody that attacks Pakistan, Afghanistan will stand with Pakistan;
Afghanistan will be a brother of Pakistan. Afghanistan will never betray a
brother.

Now, our relations with India, our signing of [the] strategic partnership
with India - it did not happen at the spur of the moment. This is
something that we've been working on for years now. So the visit was not
after these troubles that took place...

Press:       It was already planned visit?

President Karzai: It was planned long before, long, long before. And with
the United. States and Pakistani tensions, this has not had an impact on
our attitude towards Pakistan. You know this; you know that we have had
this engagement with Pakistan for a long time. And which comes to a
brother to brother relationship. You will find that Afghanistan will be
there with you in times of difficulty. And that is the pain that we have.
That is the pain that we have. Please, brother, stop using all methods
that hurt us and are now hurting you. Let's engage from a different
platform, a platform in which the two brothers only [inaudible] towards a
better future in peace and harmony. And Afghanistan will be with you. So,
Afghanistan is not going to be dictated in any way by any country - U.S.,
or India, or Russia, or China or whoever. Afghanistan has its own policy,
its own stand, its own clear view on things. And from that point of view,
from that stand, it's dealing with our brothers in Pakistan.

Kurt can give you Karzai's version of what he said which isn't what the wires had. We should try to get the full GEO

Sir:

We checked with Toria but she said the Secretary simply said "that wouldn't happen" when asked about Karzai's
remarks and Christiane didn't follow up.

Below is a revision of the draft guidance, as Gavin found a quote that we think fits well with this from the Secretary's
presser with Karzai. We have sent this to Washington as well. The NYTimes has called and Gavin will give them your
guidance (the first bullet) as a statement.
