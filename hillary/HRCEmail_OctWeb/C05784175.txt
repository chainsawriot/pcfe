Subject: Pakistan fills vacant U.S. envoy position (Reuters)

ISLAMABAD, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Moving quickly to fill a vacant ambassadorial post in Washington left by the resignation
of Husain Haqqani, Pakistan unexpectedly appointed a former information minister and outspoken human rights
campaigner as its new envoy.

  "The prime minister is pleased to appoint Sherry Rehman as the new ambassador to the United States," said
spokesman for the Prime Minister's office, Akram Shaheedi.

  Haqqani resigned on Tuesday, days after a Pakistani-American businessman accused him of being behind a memo that
accused the Pakistani military of plotting a coup in May.

   Tension between Pakitan's civilian government and military has bedevilled the nuclear-armed South Asian country
