Subject: NATO retrains troops after Afghan civilian deaths (AP)


KABUL (AP) - Afghan President Karzai said the top commander of U.S. and NATO troops ordered a retraining
for coalition forces following recent deaths of Afghan civilians during military operations.
   Tuesday's statement by Karzai says he received a letter from U.S. Gen. John Allen acknowledging the deaths
of the civilians in the past week.
   On Nov. 23, six children and an adult were killed in a NATO airstrike in Zhari district of Kandahar province
in southern Afghanistan. Allen said then that the incident occurred when coalition forces were responding to
offensive actions by insurgents.
   Karzai says Allen has ordered all units to retrain their troops on the procedures for using force against
insurgents while protecting Afghan civilians.
