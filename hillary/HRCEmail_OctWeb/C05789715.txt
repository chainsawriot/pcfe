Do you think we're on the road to electing a female president in the somewhat near future?
I certainly hope so. I'm going to be one of the first to ask Hillary to run in 2016. I think she would be incredibly
well-poised to be our next Democratic president. I think she's extremely well prepared. Her experience as
Secretary of State has not only elevated her stature and experience, but she's proven she's someone who can get
things done and I think she'd be an outstanding candidate.

Do you think she'll run?
I hope so.

Do you see yourself being involved in her campaign or administration, or have you talked to her about
working together in 2016?
Not at all, but I hope to be serving New York State and the people of New York State in the Senate.

Will you stay in the Senate for the long haul?
Yes, I think I can make a difference there. It's an important opportunity for public service to really have an
impact on the lives of regular people, and I feel very privileged that I have the chance to be part of these debates
and to move an agenda for to help real New Yorkers.
