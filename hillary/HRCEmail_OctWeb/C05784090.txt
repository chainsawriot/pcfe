Cheryl:

Drama is over, Bd Mtg just ended:

1. Board to dismiss MK by Dec 31st 2011 discussing exit plan but sentiment is mixed on "package" due to such profound
mismanagement

2. Hire COO ASAP/



3. Start search for new Director

3. French and EC representative threw MK under the bus when the board chair presented a letter to the board from the
CFO that referred to un-approved funds at 2.8 mil for FLO Fr as you predicted 6 weeks ago. We had votes anyway
after personnel review but this made it unanimous.

4. Board chair and Vice Chair talking to MK now

5. No money for round 11 due to very poor fiscal management

6. Working on good messaging (Lorrie helping)
