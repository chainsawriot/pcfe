Subject: Feeling a bit of gratitude

Kurt,

I could not but write to say how grateful I am to the Secretary and the administration for stepping out on the issue of
social equity for gay people in Geneva yesterday. At a personal level it means so very, very much. Reading about it the
Times this morning put a smile on my face and a spring in my step -- which I guess means that I'm lighter in the loafers
than ever.

Have a joyous Christmas.
