Subject: Egypt statement

We've been trying to capture both sides of the violence. See if the below works:

I am deeply concerned about the continuing reports of violence in Egypt. I urge Egyptian security forces to respect and
protect the universal rights of all Egyptians,'including the rights to peaceful free expression and assembly. We call upon
the Egyptian authorities to hold accountable those, including security forces, who violate these standards. Those who
are protesting should do so peacefully and refrain from acts of violence. Our thoughts are with the families of those who
have been killed or injured.
