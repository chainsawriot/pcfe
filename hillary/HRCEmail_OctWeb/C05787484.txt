Subject: Egypt Snap Poll

FYI, I've attached the results of a recent snap poll which provides a good top-line indicator of popular opinion in Egypt,
post Cairo-uprising. Caution, it was conducted on-line and thus not reflective of total population but good indicator vis-
a- vis attitudes of influentials and young people. Key points from report outlined below, full report attached.
