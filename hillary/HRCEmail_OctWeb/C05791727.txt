So the Jordanians are working on a face to face meeting or series of meetings with the parties. The aim is to get the first
for this week in Jordan when I'm there. The idea is to try to get some sort of negotiation without preconditions going.
Not sure of all details yet but I will report back when I'm there. But worth a try! Hope you're having a good Christmas.
Best Tony
