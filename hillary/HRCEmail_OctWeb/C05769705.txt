Jake,

Thanks very much to you and S staff for getting S' signature on the joint
letter to EP Parliament President Buzek.

At the risk of pressing my luck, I wonder if she would be willing to go
ahead and make the three calls — Westerwelle, Papandreou + Miliband.

The German call is most important. The Ger EU commissioner is holding up
Commission statement supporting the interim agreement.
I will send updated call sheet.
