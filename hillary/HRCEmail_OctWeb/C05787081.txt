Who's behind the new website? It's a great idea.

And, yes, we have a ways to go in Libya but I'm pleased we've made this much progress. We just have to get it on the
right path to an inclusive representative democracy that respects the universal rights of all (read women!)

First of all, bravo on Libya! I know just how far we still have to go, but the bottom line is that we were right. But here's
the cull from my Twitter feed today â€” a website dedicated to getting people to see Africa differently. Here is the link and
the blurb (they send out regular tweets).

http://www.seeafricadifferentiv.com/


Africa is 54 diverse countries filled with people working to bring about positive changes. Our site is going to showcase
exciting news, videos and personal stories from the world's second largest continent.
