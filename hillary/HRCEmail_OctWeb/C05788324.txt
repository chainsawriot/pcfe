This morning, I spoke by telephone with Pagan Amum, SPLM Secretary General and lead negotiator for the GoSS. He
had just finished a press conference in which he stated that the shutdown of oil production across South Sudan is being
carried out in a gradual and responsible manner and is largely complete.

understand why the South Sudanese are doing this now, but it has consequences, such as deterring future investment.
                                                    I told him about my speech in South Africa recently

                       I asked Pagan to respect the people, reminding him they are not a liberation movement
anymore, but a government. I reiterated that I understand his position



Pagan interjected that it is important to analyze the situation carefully.




I relayed to Pagan that President Kiir told Secretary Clinton that he wants a negotiated solution. Then, Pagan clarified
his stance. He said,




I reiterated that we are on their side. I have told everyone that the GoSS is negotiating constructively.
                                  He said they would stay forward leaning and generous and
             I told him I would be in Juba on the 2e and asked if he would be back, which he did not answer. I explained
that I have been working hard on the humanitarian concerns in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile and that is why I will
not be in Addis until the AU Summit.
