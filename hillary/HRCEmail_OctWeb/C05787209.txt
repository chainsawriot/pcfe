Background: Election season in Nigeria is in full swing, with parliamentary, presidential, and gubernatorial elections
scheduled for April 2, 9, and 16, respectively. President Jonathan has been on the campaign trail, most of this month.
Nigerian officials still resent Qaddafi's suggestion last year that Nigeria be divided in multiple countries in response to its
ethno-religious violence, and have been supportive of our efforts to date.
