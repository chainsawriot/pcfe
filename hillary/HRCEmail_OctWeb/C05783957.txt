Subject: Appropriations Floor Update

Jake, Alice — Would one of you pass the floor update below to S? Thought she'd like an update
on that status of our bill. Thanks. Dave

Madam Secretary — As expected, Senator Reid moved today (11/15) to amend the pending Energy and Water
appropriations bill to add our bill plus the Financial Services bill to create the second "minibus" appropriations
package. Senators Menendez, Nelson, Rubio all objected to the motion because of language allowing bank to bank
transactions between Cuba and the United States contained in the Financial Services bill.

Senator Reid then offered a modified motion that removed the Cuba language. Senators Moran (KS) and Vitter both
objected. Moran because he supports the Cuba bank transfer language and Vitter because of Mexico City policy, UNFPA
and what he described as language permitting abortion on demand in Washington DC.

Senator Reid then proceeded to fill the amendment tree on the underlying Energy and Water bill, essentially freezing
action on the Senate floor until some sort of agreement is reached on the universe of amendments to be
considered. That agreement could encompass amendments to our bill or simply to Energy and Water. So we are in a
holding pattern until Senators figures out how they would like to go forward.

Senator Reid has made it clear that he intends to complete the conference report on the first "minibus" which contains
the CR through December 16th as well as the Defense authorization bill before adjourning for Thanksgiving and has
already threatened to keep the Senate in through the weekend and into early next week.
