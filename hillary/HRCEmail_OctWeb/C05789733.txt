The Secretary is speaking tonight at Transparency International dinner.
Our firm has a table and I was planning to attend so if you are there, please come by to say hello.

Good meeting of the advisory board on Monday. I'm glad we could fix both countries' problems. I know the group,
including me, is simply honored to be consulted.
