Feel free to send suggestions anytime. We'll follow up -- it always helps to cover all the bases. And you're right about
the health risks!
Thanks, Raj

Thanks - I agree that measles or cholera or another infectious disease would be a huge set back.

We have a joint USAID/CDC team down there working with WHO (PAHO in Haiti) to do surveillance. They have a system
set up with 30+ sentinel sites and found a case that was originally reported as measles. We followed up on that case
report and were told it was chicken pox - not measles.

Regardless, immunization campaigns should start this coming week. We will stay on top of this issue but it is a priority
one and we pulled one of our best people on this from India (Ron Waldman) and sent them to Haiti to make sure there
is leadership on the ground. I will double check the size/scale of the vaccination campaign.

Raj

Did you see this? Measles worst (common) outbreak to occur in a refugee setting. Spreads like wildfire and high case
fatality rate. Very scary. Hope vaccinations happening in all the camps of kids under 15. If not, should be!!!
