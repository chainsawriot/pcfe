Subject: Message from key interlocutor

Burma team:

Our key Thursday night dinner/Friday morning interlocutor, whom we met yesterday, asked to see Rangoon DCM today
(Tuesday) as a follow up. She expressed concern that hardliners, led by Than Shwe, are signaling to NPT that authorities
are moving too quickly in including her and her party in the political process. She says that delay tactics (like possibly
postponing by-elections until March or beyond) may be designed to incorporate steps that exclude rather than include.

She expressed no reservations with our planned moves/announcements, previewed and discussed yesterday, but did ask
that we not limit our asks to political prisoners. She said it would be helpful for S to convey that we will "not make any big
steps" until the authorities a) release political prisoners; b) hold free, fair by-elections, and c) ensure that her party is a part
of the process.

Comment: Not sure why she didn't convery this yesterday, but apparently after sleeping on it overnight she concluded
that the hardliners are on the job, and that the visit is an important opportunity to thwart their specific tactics.

Patrick
