Thought you were airborne. The event went well. It was big. Way over a 1000 members of the community, most in
Caracol Park shirts, over 100 press, all the Senators, Deputies, Ministers, Chambers of Commerce, Mayors, several local
schools in uniforms, the Walmart and KohIs executives were very pleased, great images, the consecutive and
simultaneous translators did a great job.
Spoke to WJC. He though it was good. Your name was in most of the speeches: I am not used to doing events like that
and being in charge of every tiny detail , so it was an interesting experience. Did I mention how much I miss Caitlin?

Big downside was that           was about 90minutes late                                                                    B1
