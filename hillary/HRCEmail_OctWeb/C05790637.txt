On Eric Goosby memo, haven't seen. Will track down.

We have discussed the idea of taking business delegations to Cambodia, Korea and Vietnam. As you know, jake wants to
take them on many trips this year. Assume you endorse.

We don't have locked dates for Dip Center. Aiming for April and we will start identifying and showing you. Will be spread
out over a couple of months.
                                                                                                                            B6
Already offered letter for                    birthday party. Will see if they want video too.

On         , she has begged us too but I don't think you can go if there's even a 1 percent chance that      will be
there. As you know, they are pushing hard for you to see him and have hosted him several times in DC. We should
discuss.

For UAE, as you know, back in Jan we offered to do it this spring. They cannot do it before the summer and at this point,
we have no natural trip to add it to. My thought was to do it if we ever ended up in Egpyt so its been on the backburner
and last I left it with Yousef, it would be post-september. III work on it.

Also, closed loop with melanne after your bilat with jahjaga that you will do her womens conf in the fall. and told
melanne to confirm the mongolia womens conf in conjuction with community of democracies.

Have you seen the memo from Eric Goosby about speaking opportunities at the AIDS Conference this summer? We
should discuss.

Have you discussed internally the idea of taking business delegations to Cambodia, Korea and Vietnam as Kurt
suggested?

Do we have dates for the Diplomacy Center events from Elizabeth Bagley?

PIs be sure I offer a video or a letter for                   birthday party.

On March 23          is having a birthday party fort the Willard Hotel and begged me to come by. I told her I had to
go to Saudi Arabia but now I'm not. So I don't know what time it is but would be willing to stop by if you think it is
important. What do you think?

I told Marcia Dyson I would see her so pls add her to list.
