FYI. This is Feltman's view.

Subject: Friends of Yemen: who represents Yemen?

To all:

I mentioned this to D(L) today in the Thursday staff meeting, and I'd be grateful to have guidance from the Secretary.
The issue is whether Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh should be invited to the Friends of Yemen meeting in London.
(If it's not Saleh, Yemen's rep would probably be Yemeni Foreign Minister Abubakr Qirby, who will be in Washington
next week.)
