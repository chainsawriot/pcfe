I can manage that on my own -- am meeting Mike this week. But it's symptomatic of larger issue, which if we don't
change now by more forceful measures than we've been willing to take thus far is going to become a fait accompli. AM

If there are papers that Mike is not sharing I should call him or Larry first                    If you let me know topics I
will make calls tomrw.

All,
On a completely different subject, my crew has been monitoring G20 preparations and the situation is going from bad to
worse in terms of 1) the expansion of the g20 agenda into politics and 2) the degree to which we are getting closed out.
One of the things that came out of pittsburgh was a working group on "financial inclusion," meaning microfinance,
mobile banking, etc -- all stuff HRC has been deeply engaged with. We only found out about it more or less by chance in
a phone call w/ lael -- I have a v good person going to the meetings but Treasury runs the show. Papers are being written
by other policy planners on the future of the G20 that mike is balking at sharing. There are other examples.

The sherpas next meet Jan 13 -- if we're going to change sq it has to b now. What about S
Explaing that she really doesn't                                 Jut that this is hurting US ability to advance its interests
b/c of a stupid turf fight. We can get her talking pts tomorrow and I can raise it at the 8:45 meeting. What to you think?
AM
