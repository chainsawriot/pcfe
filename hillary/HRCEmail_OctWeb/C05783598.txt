Subject: Berlusconi resigns amid jeering, celebrations (Reuters)



ROME (Reuters) -    Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi formally resigned on Saturday, ending one of the most
scandal-plagued eras in recent Italian history amid the jeers of hundreds of protestors gathered in central Rome
to celebrate his departure.

   President Giorgio Napolitano accepted Berlusconi's resignation after a meeting in the presidential palace, his
office said.

    Berlusconi, who failed to secure a majority in a crucial vote on Tuesday, handed in his resignation after
parliament passed a package of measures demanded by European partners to restore market confidence in Italy's
strained public finances.

   Former European Commissioner Mario Monti is expected to be given the task of trying to form a new
administration to face a widening financial crisis which has sent Italy's borrowing costs to unmanageable
levels.
