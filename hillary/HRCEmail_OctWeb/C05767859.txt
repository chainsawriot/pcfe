CONGRESSIONAL ISSUES

      O    The Senate Appropriations Full Committee would like a joint hearing with the Secretary and Secretary Gates on
           March 23 or 24 on Af/Pak Supplemental. Jack said if we did this, it would be good to combine with Iraq Supp
           and Haiti, if that is on the Hill by then.



      O    Rich reported a good meeting with AIPAC on Iran sanctions.

PUBLIC AFFAIRS

      O    Richard Holbrooke will give a briefing today on his recent trip and the civilian surge in Marjah.

      O    Much attention in the British press as to whether we have agreed to "help" or "mediate" in the Falklands
           dispute between Britain and Argentina.

      O    The five Americans held in Pakistan could be charged today

   •      The two remaining American missionaries in Haiti could be freed today.

LEGAL ISSUES

   •      Uighurs case was returned by the Supreme Court for rehearing, given the fact that all of them have received
          offers of resettlement elsewhere.

   •                                                                                                                             B5




DEPUTIES MEETING -- HIGHLIGHTS

WHA

   •      Noted that the press is starting to pick up on the theme that the Chileans were too proud to ask for international
          assistance. We are pushing back on this, noting that the Chileans have a great deal of indigenous capacity and
          wanted to be precise about what assistance they requested.




   •      There was an interagency meeting on a model Bilateral Investment Treaty yesterday at which some agencies
          that had not previously been players raised concerns. We will work through those. This remains very important
          for our economic relations in Asia.

PRM

   •      PRM wondered if there is any thought of Temporary Protected Status for Chileans. Craig Kelly said he did not
          think so, noting that there has not been much Chilean immigration to the U.S. in recent years, and most of those
          who have arrived are documented.

NEA

   •      Iraqi election preparations are generally going well.

   •      Abu Mazen is in Cairo for the Arab League Follow-up Committee.

   •      Still waiting to see what will happen with the 90 Arab homes slated for possible demolition in E. Jerusalem.

EUR

    •     Armenia Genocide Resolution will be marked up in the HFAC on Thursday. Sending up a call sheet for the
          Secretary to call Speaker Pelosi and others on this.

      •   Greek Prime Minister in town next week.

PIRACY

      •   PM reported that tomorrow                                                                                            1.4(D)
                 The pirates were seized by USS Farragut in the act of attempting to take over a Tanzanian-flagged             B1
          vessel. The Tanzanian Government has refused to prosecute and has questioned whether the vessel was
          actually under their flag, and the crew is refusing to testify. The Kenyans say that they cannot take any more

      pirates for prosecution. It is not clear whether, absent the testimony of the crew, the testimony of U.S. Naval
      personnel would suffice.                                                               (Note: I've asked PM to
      send the Secretary a memo on this.)




•     Johnnie confirmed that the Kenyans claim they have no more capacity for prosecution, having accepted as many
      as 150 pirates up to now. He added that the international community has not stepped up.


•     On Somalia, Johnnie reported the situation is deteriorating — now have "in-land piracy" in Puntland. Bandits
      have captured 8-9 WFP food trucks and are holding the drivers for ransom.

•     On the good news front, Kenya has agreed to open another refugee camp for Somali refugees, but needs
      funding. PRM noted we will announce a $200 million commitment to UNHCR, which should help.




•     Recent elections in Tajikistan were beyond the pale in terms of level of manipulation. Our embassy has issued a
      critical statement as has the OSCE.
