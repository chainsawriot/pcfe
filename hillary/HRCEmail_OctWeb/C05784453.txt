Jake/Alice: I had a good meeting with Kazakh FM Kazykhanov whom the Secretary will see tomorrow in Vilnius. A few
new points came up that are not covered in the BCL:

- he passed me a paper of further steps Kz is prepared to take in Afghanistan, including:

-- making their current program to train 1,000 Afghans a permanent training program;
-- creating a new media training program;
-- establishing a logistics center in the port of Aktau on the Caspian to help build more regional trade;
-- building rail links through Turkmenistan to Afghanistan, including the possibility of Kz helping to extend the Turkmen
line from the Border to the Afghan rail line.

All of this of course is very welcome. He also confirmed he will pass a note to the Secretary with their written
agreement to the NDN reverse transit.
