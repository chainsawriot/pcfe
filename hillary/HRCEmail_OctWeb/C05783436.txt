Subject: Obama condemns Kurdish attack on Turkey as outrageous (Reuters)

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama condemned a Kurdish assault Wednesday that killed
24 Turkish soldiers as an "outrageous terrorist attack".

   "The United States will continue our strong cooperation with the Turkish government as it works to defeat
the terrorist threat from the PKK and to bring peace, stability and prosperity to all the people of southeast
Turkey," Obama said in a statement.

    Turkish officials said about 100 fighters from the PKK, or Kurdistan Workers Party, mounted simultaneous
attacks under cover of darkness on seven remote army outposts in Hakkari province, on Turkey's rugged
southeastern border with Iraq.
