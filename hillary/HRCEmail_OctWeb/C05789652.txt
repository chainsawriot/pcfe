It went according to script

1. Based on information they have from sources available to them, including the opposition, a fragile cease-fire appears
to have taken effect. But isolated incidents of fighting have been reported, including one uncomfirmed report of shells
fired in Horns. (He would welcome any info from us on that, if we have it).

2. But this does not constitute full compliance, as the disposition and posture of Syrian forces and weapons around
population centers remains intimidating and it remains to be seen what the government's compliance will be on other
aspects of the six-point plan.

3. JSE will seek UNSC authorization for an "advance team" to go into Syria, to establish liaison with the parties and begin
reporting on the situation on the ground. He thinks they should go right away to get a foot in the door and to avoid any
excuses by any side that their absence contributed to the breakdown of the ceasefire, were that to happen.

4. He will also ask the UNSC to express its intention to authorize a full monitoring mission, spelling out the authorities
the monitors would require and possess to operate effectively, notably freedom of movement, freedom of access. and
unobstructed communications. He would want the UNSC to assert those authorities rather than making them subject to
an agreement with the Syrian government, which could take forever to negotiate.

5. There are a few reasons why he does not want to ask for the full mission to be authorized now. First, he wants a few
days to assess the true nature of the cease-fire and whether it has held. And he wants to assess how the government
deals with the advance team. If it obstructs them, he could recall them; if they are able to work freely, that would be a
positive sign to move forward.
