AM--I think this makes good sense. How should we follow up?

Subject: Google email hacking and woeful state of civilian technology

I'm sure you've thought of this, but it would be a great time for someone inside or outside to make a statement/ write
an op-ed that points out that State's technology is so antiquated that NO ONE uses a State-issued laptop and even high
officials routinely end up using their home email accounts to be able to get their work done quickly and
effectively. Further cuts to State's budget just makes matters much much worse. We actually need more funds to
significantly upgrade our technology. AM
