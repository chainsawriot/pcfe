Please pass on to the Secretary how moved I was by the program last Thursday. I was there as a Mount Holyoke alum as
well as a committed public servant and was so proud by the response, especially by the young women who
attended. And many of us oldsters were crying at what will certainly be a profound legacy of the Secretary's (among so
many other things).

Some of the women there were crying because of the enormous commitment that was made by the full day
program. Some were crying out of buyers' remorse.

It was a home run.
