Secretary Clinton, we have been discussing this all weekend and are engaged with AJE both here in Washington and in
PaP. As Judith will explain, her intervention has already yielded some moderated coverage. We will stay focused. Pi

Fyi, from AJE. Important that we continue to aggressively and immediately challenge inaccurate stories at the highest
levels.

Dear Judith-
       UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768915 Date: 10/30/2015
       UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768915 Date: 10/30/2015




Thank you for the note regarding Gordon Duguid. I passed it on to our group in Haiti, and they had already heard from
one of your State Dept colleagues about him. You may have heard that he was interviewed on Al Jazeera English late
yesterday (about the airport situation), and this was broadcast throughout several of our newscasts during the evening,
including our flagship AJE 'Newshours'.




I'm glad we talked about these concerns. After our call, I was able to track down the ME news report that was the
source of your frustration. It was the one which included references to the 'green zone', 'Baghdad' and 'soldiers
carrying guns'. Overall, I too found the report unsatisfactory and we have put in steps internally that will hopefully
ensure this kind of thing doesn't happen again. I am very sympathetic to the pressure-cooker environment everyone is
dealing with in Haiti at the moment, but I thought our team's references in this particular case were gratuitous and
uncalled for.




I obviously think there was a valid angle to cover on Sunday — le: the complaints by the governments of Brazil and
France, as well as Medicins Sans Frontieres about the handling of the airport. And I'm sure you too saw this story in all
the major newspapers, including The New York Times and Washington Post on Monday. I have been told that our team
did try to get US Military (and UN) reaction in Port-au-Prince early Sunday for this story and was rebuffed. That was
unfortunate, particularly since I note that the US Military gave a response to The New York Times reporter. I'm glad
that, eventually and possibly due to your intervention, they became available to us.




I am not suggesting that this justifies the flaws in our piece, but it didn't help. I acknowledge the openness now of the
State Department and Pentagon in Washington to engage with Al Jazeera on stories such as these, but I don't think this
is always evident in the field by US Military representatives (and other US officials). I look forward to doing what I can to
improve this situation.




But I repeat my earlier request that you and your colleagues keep this particular incident in perspective.




I know that this report was been sent around perhaps as an 'example' of ME coverage, but — if so- I think that would be
unfair and inaccurate. This was one news report out of a dozen broadcast on ME from Haiti on Sunday (and nearly a
hundred since the earthquake happened.) and it did not dominate our coverage by any means.




As you know, we interviewed PJ Crowley about this situation — and our report — later on Sunday and this interview was
featured prominently in our ME Newshours. We also eventually got access to Christopher Loundermon, the US Navy
Spokesman for Joint Task Force Haiti.




Yesterday (Monday) we included interviews with Brig-General Berger of the US Marine Corps as part of our prime time
Newshours in Europe/the Middle East (9pm Doha, lpm ET) and, later, during our prime time Newshour from the
       UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768915 Date: 10/30/2015

Americas (9pm ET, 5am Doha Tuesday). These programs also included interviews with Lt.-Gen. Keen of US Southern
Command and, as I mentioned, Gordon Duguid from your Department.




In the future, the quickest way to reach me is via email/blackberry I                            or — as I mentioned —
my personal cell number                   Email is perhaps quicker since I often turn down my phone in meetings.




Thank you and best wishes,




Tony

Here's the information for Gordon. Please feel free to contact him at any time. If you want, and if possible, he may be
able to arrange for your crew to go out with one of the teams delivering relief supplies bearing in mind that things are
very fluid there.
