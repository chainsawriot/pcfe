Subject:                               Tallinn principles



These are they:

1. NATO remains a nuclear Alliance
2. As a nuclear Alliance, member states share risks and responsibilities
3. NATO should reduce the role and number of nuclear weapons
4. NATO allies should take on a mission pursuing territorial missile defense
5. NATO should specify the conditions for further arms control agreements
with Russia

Or longer version:

    •    As long as nuclear weapons exist, NATO will remain a nuclear alliance;

    •    As a nuclear alliance, widely sharing nuclear risks and responsibilities is fundamental;

    •    The broader goal of the alliance must be to reduce the number and role of nuclear weapons and recognize that NATO has
         already dramatically reduced its reliance on nuclear weapons;

    •    The alliance must broaden deterrence against 21st century threats, including missile defense, strengthen Article V training and
         exercises, and draft additional contingency plans to counter new threats.

    •    In any future reductions "our aim should be to seek Russian agreement to increase transparency on non-strategic nuclear
         weapons in Europe, relocate these weapons away from the territory of NATO members, and include non-strategic nuclear
         weapons in the next round of U.S.-Russian arms control discussions alongside strategic and non-deployed nuclear weapons.
