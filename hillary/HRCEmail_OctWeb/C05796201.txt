Subject: Agrement

Than Swe, perm rep in NY, called (his on a trip to Kuwait). He said he spoke with his FM. No problem
at with our candidate. President will be given official papers tomorrow, before the long holidays, and
this will include the Burmese nominee for Washington. The GOB will want two agrements to take
place at the same time, because 10 years ago, Washington would not approve the GOB nominee (I
think it was the current FM, no?).

I don't know what the likelihood of all of this before the long holidays, but Than Swe was hopeful...
