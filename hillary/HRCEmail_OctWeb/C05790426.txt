From paris is:
- format : 14 Ministers of the Core Group have confirmed including Davutoglu, HBJ, Othmani, Westerwelle. Lavrov just
told us he would not attend.

- timing : 6pm to 10pm at the Quai d'Orsay (6pm-7:30 : meeting / 7:30-8pm : press conference / 8pm-10pm : dinner). So
we could do press conf there ideally and leave.

- objectives : support Kofi's efforts and prepare for a robust observation mission ; reaffirm all the requirements of the
Annan plan toward the Syrian regime. They see this as an ad hoc meeting that does not substitute for the Group of
Friends which will still be planned for May.
