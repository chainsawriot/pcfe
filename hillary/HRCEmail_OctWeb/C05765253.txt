Jack, Cheryl and Jake: I wanted to flag for you a challenge to manage.                                     as we were
drafting the Somalia paper, for State to make a recommendation and to know if the Secretary had seen/cleared the
paper. I was very careful to equivocate, noting that this document had been reviewed on the 7th floor with D Lew, D
Steinberg and P Burns staff all at various meetings and constantly saying (as the paper does) that these are decisions
that           will need to take jointly understanding all of the repercussions.




Piper

Heading off to Mexico in the morning, so apologies if subsequent emails aren't answered in a timely fashion.
