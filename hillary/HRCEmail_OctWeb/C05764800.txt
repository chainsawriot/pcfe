SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED

Middle East Peace Report

      o   Cheryl noted that there had been discussion about when the Secretary would give her report on the Middle East
          peace process, but that this would not happen "mid-October," but rather likely later in the month.

Goldstone Report

      •   Jim said he has been working on a strategy for the Goldstone report. The problem is that without progress on
          the overriding set of issues, it is hard to head off a bad resolution.

Civilian Effort in Afghanistan

      •   Jack raised the need to get our story out on the civilian side of our effort in Afghanistan, noting that some in the
          press have been alleging that we "are not getting out of Kabul." This is not true, but we need to be able to point
          to tangible progress in order to drive this point home.

Contracts in the FATA in Pakistan

      O    Jack noted that the Pakistan grants story still has legs. There was a Dissent Channel message from an AID
           employee criticizing the suspension of the use of U.S. NGO contracts in the FATA which has been leaked to the
           press. Politico has obtained the cable and written a story about it.




Guinea

      O    Pat reported that given continued deterioration in conditions in Guinea, he and Johnnie Carson agreed family
           members should return to the U.S. (They had been housed temporarily in Dakar.)

Pakistani FM

   •    Rich said that Pakistani FM Qureshi is back in Washington this week to convey his government's concerns over
        Kerry/Lugar/Berman and the alleged infringement on Pakistani sovereignty.




    •




Senator DeMint

    •    Rich reported no progress on getting DeMint to lift his holds.

Legal Issues

    •    Harold raised the Brazil Air Bridge Denial. Jim said he would sign it, but wanted to make it clear in the memo
         that we will have a review of the policy.

    •    Naji Hamdan has been sentenced to 18 months in prison in UAE. He has already served 14 months, so should be
         released in four months.

    •    The Chinese legal counselor called Harold last night to ask for assistance with a default judgment against China,
         apparently in an expropriation case. He will get more details today.

Deputies Meeting

The meeting was very short and covered little new ground, with the following exceptions:

Honduras

    •    Tom Shannon said that the two sides are reporting progress in ongoing negotiations, but they have yet to tackle
         the tough issue of the return of Zelaya to office.

Turkey and Armenia

    •    EUR reported that the Turks will submit the agreement signed with Armenia over the weekend to Parliament
         today as promised, making it possible for the Armenian President to visit Turkey for the soccer match.
