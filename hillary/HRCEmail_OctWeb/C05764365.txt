See note             from Rahm and my response.                                                                                  B5

On the other matter, HRC participating in NBC a woman's nation fest? They want her. This, by the way has been a huge
coup for CAP. We continue to lead the pack.

How do you think A Woman's Nation is going?                   is a media hurricane. I am in fucking awe. Given what I hear       B6
about Liebovitch story, he should have some good deliverables for Guthrie interview. More flex time for fed workers;
joint hearing between Biden mctf and Valerie's woman and girls council; some private sector pow wow on how to get
more flexible hours. Biggest finding in our poll was strong desire for work place flexibility to deal with stress of 2 earners
and family needs.
