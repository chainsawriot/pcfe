Subject: Syrian National Council reaches out to Kurds (Reuters)



TUNIS (Reuters) - The head of the main opposition Syrian National Council (SNC) sought to reassure Syrian
Kurds they would have a place in a post-Bashar al-Assad country, promising decentralised government and
national recognition of Kurdish identity.

   "The new Syria will have a decentralised government, thereby enabling local authorities to take control of
their affairs," Burhan Ghalioun said, according to a copy of his speech to the "Friends of Syria" meeting in
Tunis.

   "Your identity will be nationally recognised and respected and your rights as citizens will be assured. You
will play a significant role in rebuilding the Syria of our dreams, the Syria of which we have been dreaming for
decades."

   Ghalioun, who has drawn some criticism over his position on the Kurds in the past, said there was no
contradiction between a Syria that embraces its Arab character and that respects Kurdish national identity and
assures Kurds equal rights before the law.
