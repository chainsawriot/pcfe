Hi Les -- you'll see why I thought of you when I read this about President Nazarbayev's speech on the future of
Kazakhstan's foreign policy:

"Nazarbayev specifically tasked the foreign ministry with bringing economic diplomacy to the forefront of Kazakhstan's
foreign policy. "We risk being left on the sidewalk if we do not get into the [new] geo-economic stream,"
he said. Noting that foreign policy is the continuation of the domestic policy of any state, Nazarbayev charged the group
of diplomats with the task of modernizing the diplomatic service to be compatible with the country's recent economic
and social innovation."

Best,
Steve
