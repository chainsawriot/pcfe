Damn. Hope you feel OK. FYI: On the night Lincoln lost the Senate seat to Douglas, he walked home
alone in Springfield. It had just rained and was muddy and he tripped. "A slip, not a fall," he said.

See NYT poll this am on public beginning to divide Obama persona from policies? See below. That's
the vulnerability of charisma. To protect it requires successful policies.

On Iran, a slight ratchet in tone: government should adhere to own standards on elections and rein in
paramilitary violence. France and other Europeans have been outspoken. The Twitter episode,
keeping it going, is enough to provide grist to regime for US interference already if it choses to point
to something. Should Britain say this? Can be arranged. US should, first, also for reasons below.

Obama Poll Sees Doubt on Budget and Health Care
By JEFF ZELENY and DALIA SUSSMAN
A substantial majority of Americans say President Obama has not developed a strategy to deal with the budget
deficit, according to=2 Othe latest New York Times/CBS News poll, which also found that support for his plans
to overhaul health care, rescue the auto industry and close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, falls well
below his job approval ratings.
A distinct gulf exists between Mr. Obama's overall standing and how some of his key initiatives are viewed,
with fewer than half of Americans saying they approve of how he has handled health care and the effort to save
General Motors and Chrysler. A majority of people said his policies have had either no effect yet on improving
the economy or had made it worse, underscoring how his political strength still rests on faith in his leadership
rather than concrete results.
As Mr. Obama finishes his fifth month in office and assumes greater ownership of the problems he inherited,
Americans are alarmed by the hundreds of billions of dollars that have been doled out to boost the economy. A
majority said the government should instead focus on reducing the federal deficit.
But with a job approval rating of 63 percent, Mr. Obama has the backing of Democrats and independents alike,
a standing that many presidents would envy and try to use to build support for their policies. His rating has
fallen to 23 percent among Republicans, from 44 percent in February, a sign that bridging the partisan divide
may remain an unaccompli shed goal.
The poll was conducted after Mr. Obama completed his fourth international trip as president. He received high
marks for his focus abroad, with 59 percent of those polled saying they approve of his approach to foreign
policy. And after weeks of criticism from former Vice President Dick Cheney and other Republicans, 57
percent say they approve of how Mr. Obama has dealt with the threat of terrorism.
The White House is entering a critical summer with Mr. Obama pledging to push his plans to revamp health
care and financial regulation through Congress and Senate hearings scheduled on his first nominee to the
Supreme Court. The poll suggested Americans remain patient, even as a strong majority expressed concern that
they or someone in their family could lose their jobs in the next year.
