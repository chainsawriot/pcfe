Philippe, Caroline, Lona and I are sitting at an outdoor table a close walk from the suite (at Kayaputi restaurant). We just
walked in and are thinking about dinner. Its beautiful by the water if you care to join.

Heard room service is great too. I left menus for you in your suite. Let me know if you'd like anything.

I'm going to take a walk to check out the grounds and should be back in abt 20 minutes. Jake and Philippe don't plan to
go to bulgari tonight. Everyone is walking around to see what's here.

You have a private beach behind the back gate but there are agents posted back there right now.
