David Lesch is an outstanding scholar. More importantly he was the #1 draft pick of the LA Dodgers in 1980 - a brilliant
pitcher who unfortunately developed a sore arm.

Madam Secretary, sorry for the delay in a response. But this required more thought that I could give it on the margins of
yet another Abdullah bin Zayed event last night that continued into the wee hours!

Subject: Syria

The following report came to me, and I think it rings true. Do any of you know Lesch or Khiyami? Pls feel free to share.



The report below comes to me only from my friend, David Lesch, leading Syria expert in the U.S. Whether or not the
suggestions of the Syrian ambassador to the U.K. can produce any positive outcomes, they are reflective of a high
diplomat of the regime claiming to speak frankly.

From David Lesch: Returned from my trip to London yesterday. I met with the Syrian ambassador to UK, Sami Khiyami,
but I was not able to meet with Asma's father. Sami is a very interesting person. He is secular Sunni, very
straightforward and forthright (for a Syrian official), and not a member of the Ba‘th party. He was pretty frank with me,
and I got the impression he believes he and his government could be on their way out, so no harm in telling it like it
is. He was critical of Bashar al-Asad, although he still supports him as the best alternative, and he was incredibly critical
of, even dismissive, of the security services, who he essentially said were too stupid to do anything right. I asked him if
he could tell President Obama or Secretary Clinton one thing, what would it be? His response was interesting. He said
that he would vigorously ask the US to stop supporting groups such as the Syrian National Council b/c they have very
little legitimacy or popularity in Syria. He strongly recommended showing outward support for the serious and
respected Syrian opposition elements in Syria itself, people such as Michel Kilo, Riyad Seif, Louay Hussein, etc. In his
view, these are people of substance who have been both jailed and part of the government apparatus, so they are
generally respected in both circles (govt and populace). They are the only ones who can lead the country through a
transition period toward a more democratic system. Of course, he recognized, as I told him, the difficulty in getting
Syrian govt support for this. Bashar tried half-heartedly in the summer to do this through a national dialogue, but it did
not go anywhere (and as Sami told me, the govt did not handle it very well). It might be that the govt might be more
amenable to such an approach now b/c of growing difficulties. Sami said that it would not eliminate all of the
opposition, since there are many wedded to the fall of the regime no matter what, but that it would draw enough
support to isolate the radicals, who would whither away eventually, and create a critical mass to force the regime to
follow through (especially with regional and international pressure holding its feet to the fire) and transition toward
 sharing power. Although it may be a bit self-serving, I happen to agree with him. The SNC and other opposition

groups have very little if any traction inside Syria. Need to get guys like Kilo and Seif and the Local Coordination
Committees in Syria on the same page with some sort of govt sanction, in combination with an end to violence. I think it
is the only way this doesn't end up in a bloody civil war. Not easy to say the least, first and foremost b/c you have to get
Bashar and his cronies to go along with it--tough sell. In addition, Syrian opposition elements in the country may not go
with it. It may be past the point of no return. He also added one more request: get the Qataris to stop causing so much
trouble in Syria in a way that is leading toward militarization of the crisis. He said he would make a formal request to
Bashar for me to see him within the next month or so. Yale University Press has asked me to write a very quick 100-120
page book on Syria and the Arab spring and Bashar al-Asad, with the final draft due in April, so it is under this pretext
that I would be going. Not holding my breath on this, although Bashar seems more willing to talk to people now.
