Subject: Constitutional Committee



We have talked to a number of liberals today, who are not inclined to return to the constitutional committee. Right
now, Field Marshall Tantawi is meeting with all the parties in an attempt to mediate this issue and address a possible no
confidence vote in the Ghanzouri government. We should have a readout of this meeting shortly after it
concludes. (We sent in a cable about half way through our outreach today.)

Liberals believe the only card they have to play is embarrassing the MB. They are leaning toward participating in a
parallel constitution drafting process, but don't rule out other options. These would include returning to the original
committee (which is supposed to start work tomorrow) if there was broad agreement to include the Al Azhar "bill of
rights" in the constitution. They are also asking the SCAF to revise the original decree that essentially Out the drafting of
the constitution under the control of the newly elected parliament. (This is a real long shot.)

And some of the liberals are in direct contact with the MB (at the MB's initiative.)
