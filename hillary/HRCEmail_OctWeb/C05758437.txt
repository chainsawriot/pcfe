I raised both forcefully yesterday. Glad there was followup. Be sure Bill doesn't act all nice. A little sternness is in order.

Billâ€”




It has been brought to my attention that I kinda blew it on the Sri Lanka and Armenia statements. I had wrongly
assumed that both were run through you Big Chesses before they got to me. I know now that neither had, and I regret
that.




Lesson learned on that one. Won't be repeated.




Best,

DM
