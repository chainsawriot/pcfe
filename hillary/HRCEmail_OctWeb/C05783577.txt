             American Mayors' Letter to President Obama on Keystone XL Tar Sands Pipeline


                                                                                                1

      November 16, 2011                                                             RELEASE IN FULL



      President Barack Obama
      The White House
      1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
      Washington, DC 20500

      Dear Mr. President,

      We write you today as local government leaders who are gravely concerned that
      expansion of tar sands oil imports will increase our dependence on this high carbon fuel
      for decades to come. Expansion of high carbon fuels such as tar sands undermine hard
      work by local communities everywhere to fight climate change, reduce dependence on oil,
      and create a clean energy future. We ask that you do not grant a presidential permit for
      the proposed Keystone XL pipeline that would bring high carbon tar sands from Canada
      to the U.S. Gulf Coast.

      Mayors from across the country wrote to Secretary of State Clinton about this pipeline
      project in March, 2011, asking her to address the many gaps that the Environmental
      Protection Agency identified in the environmental impact statement, and evaluate the
      project's impact on local community efforts to fight climate change and build clean
      energy economies. Unfortunately, however, the Final Environmental Impact Statement
      remains inadequate and does not address local community concerns.

      This pipeline project not only undermines local community efforts to reduce oil use and
      fight climate change, it creates risks to critical American waters such as the Ogallala
      aquifer and over 1,000 rivers. Pipeline leaks are an immediate concern: the first Keystone
      pipeline has already experienced 30 leaks in the United States and Canada in its first year.

      We want to work with your Administration to create solid and lasting energy and
      economic security, and this is best accomplished by lessening our dependence on oil.
      Deciding against expansion of U.S. dependence on tar sands fits into your commitment to
      mass transit improvements including a rail infrastructure that reduce reliance on oil. That
      is why we ask that you find that the proposed Keystone XL tar sands pipeline is not in the
      national interest and deny its permit. We look forward to continued partnership with you
      and the Administration in improving our nation's security through a clean energy future.

      Sincerely,


      T.M. Franklin Cownie             John Dickert                  Jennifer Hosterman
