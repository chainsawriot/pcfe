Subject: Syria's Assad vows to continue crackdown - paper (Reuters)

LONDON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said the crackdown on dissidents in his
country would continue in the face of pressure from the Arab League for his government to take action to end
the bloodshed, according to an interview published late on Saturday.

  "The conflict will continue and the pressure to subjugate Syria will continue," he told Britain's Sunday Times
newspaper. "Syria will not bow down."

   He again repeated his assertion that any military action taken against Syria would create an "earthquake"
across the Middle East.

  "If they are logical, rational and realistic, they shouldn't do it because the repercussions are very dire.
Military intervention will destabilise the region as a whole, and all countries will be affected," he said.
