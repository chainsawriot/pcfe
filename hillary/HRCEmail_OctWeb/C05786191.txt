Jake, the "March of Life from Taiz to Sanaa (Dec. 18 to 24) was the genesis of this. It was an Isiah-supported march, and
many viewed Isiah as seeking to undermine the transition. Marchers called for the prosecution of Saleh and his allies, for
example. Prime Minister Basindwa views continued demonstrations by the opposition as a real thorn in his side. The
opposition is supposed to be a part of government now.




Making the whole thing worse, security forces allied to Saleh actually did wind up killing 13 demonstrators after the
march arrived in the capital.

Isiah then called for today to be the "Friday Against the American Ambassador." But Isiah did not prevail and another
theme was chosen.
