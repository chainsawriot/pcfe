Subject: Thai PM urges those in flooded areas to be patient (AP)



BANGKOK (AP) - Thailand's prime minister is urging people in flooded areas to be patient, saying the
government is working as hard as it can to drain the water.
   Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra said Monday that the flooding situation that has plagued the country
since late July is improving as waters recede. However, she noted that water spreading across western Bangkok
could drain more slowly than in other areas of the capital.
   She urged people to "tolerate the flooding situation and turn unity into power to struggle through the crisis."
Yingluck made the comments on her Facebook page.
   The national death toll from Thailand's worst floods in more than half a century has reached 562. The floods
are still affecting 22 of the country's 77 provinces.
