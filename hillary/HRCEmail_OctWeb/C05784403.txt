Subject: Yemen sets up group to oversee military, fighting goes on (Reuters)



SANAA (Reuters) - Yemen's government named a team of lawmakers December 4 to oversee the military after
four days of battles threatened to wreck a deal easing President Ali Abdullah Saleh from office.

   At least two people were killed December 4 in fighting between Saleh loyalists and opponents in the city of
Taiz, centre of ten months of protests that have driven the Arab world's poorest country to the brink of civil
war.

   The December 4 deaths bring to at least 19 the toll since December 1 from fighting in Taiz in Yemen's
south.

   Vice-President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi named the committee members who will oversee the end of
fighting and the return of forces to barracks, state news agency Saba reported.

   The opposition was not immediately available to comment on the composition of the committee which the
two sides had agreed would include equal numbers from Saleh's General People's Congress (GPC) and the
opposition Joint Meeting Parties (JMP).
