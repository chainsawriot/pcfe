Dear Senator Whitehouse,

My apologies for not responding sooner to your message last night. We've received very sensitive information, the key
elements of which we have been allowed to share only with the family given our contacts' security concerns. While we
very much appreciate the offer by you and former Senator Specter to intervene with the Syrian leadership, we
concluded that such outreach would be better left to Kofi Annan in his new capacity as UN/Arab League Special Envoy
for Syria. The humanitarian situation is part of Annan's mandate, and we do not want to risk crossing wires with that
effort. We were also concerned that the regime might misinterpret outreach by others as a USG attempt to open a
channel of communication.

I hope this is useful, and please feel free to contact me if you have any other questions.
Best,
Michelle

Any news? I can't understand why no one contacted Senator Specter after I put you all in touch. He has known
the Assads for twenty years. How about the Russians?

Tell Arlen thank you. They tried to get in again today, and turned back because of danger in the neighborhood.
Has the State Department actually talked to him about this?
