Subject:                           PDB/Schedule



MS -- the PDB transport over to the St. Regis is a little difficult. Jake suggests that you could read over at the Grand
Hyatt tomorrow. Please let me know if you feel otherwise.

Vietnam -- the bilat has been cancelled for tomorrow which gives you about 45 minutes of personal time.

Thank you -- Lona
