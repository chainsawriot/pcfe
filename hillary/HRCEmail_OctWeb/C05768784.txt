Subject: Health Care Update

Attached please find a brief status update on the Congressional debate over health care reform for the
Secretary.

As discussed in the attached memorandum, the House is in the midst of charting the course forward on
health care reform.




On May 12, 2009, the Blue Dog Coalition released their principles for health care reform. In addition to
providing a brief summary of the current state of play on health care, the attached memorandum outlines
those Blue Dog principles and demonstrates how the President's health reform proposal meets the
Coalition's goals. Talking points for use in a conversation with           and other Blue Dog Coalition
members are part of the analysis.

Thanks.
