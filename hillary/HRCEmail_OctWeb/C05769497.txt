Thank you very much I am aware that you have your hands full—and we want to be as helpful as we can be—we are a
relatively small (14,000 private university) to be taking this all on but we have the world class medical talent and
passion—Project Medicshare is actually a tiny 501C3 attached to our Global Institute(in the Miller School of Medicine)
which is managing the gifts and personnel and logistics with Barth Green, MD as the leader. We have trained a lot of the
Haitian docs and nurses over the years and have many on staff including a large number of students. I went to the
Haitian church today to pay my respects. Give the Secretary my best and if we can host meetings for you here we have
the facilities. Affectionately, Donna

Just returned from very cordial and constructive meeting with Dr Green (UM) and General Keen. Agreement on all points
re FMS. UM will ensure staffing, so there is still time to work the WH volunteer list in accordance with the vetting
procedure which Michelle shared earlier. UM was not very happy with the proposed site but understands need to move
quickly. There will be additional needs to be filled in this area soonest. Glad this is done (I hope).

The traffic seems to suggest they think they are supposed to be staffing the hospitals.

Should we reach out to them to clarify if that is not the expectation?

We are working with 1A/FI and lists of haitian-american volunteers to staff. Vetting calls for deployment are starting today 2
pm. United airlines will likely fly them all down there. HHS is in charge of credentially and liability.

Need DOD to build tent nurse camp on location of new post op hospital for 125 nurses (50 for facility and 75 for roving to
feeding sites, orphanges and ngos). Also need them to provide food, water, transport and security.

UM has been asked to manage 250 bed field hospital for post-op patients discharged from Comfort but not necessarily to

UM and its Project Medishare are effectively operating the largest volunteer hospital and
medical relief program in Haiti. We have been asked by USAID to manage and staff a new 250
bed prefab hospital which will be up in the next 2 to 3 days. We are coordinating massive
deployment of medical personel and equipment and supplies across Haiti. I need to meet with
the US Ambassador today to get his support. At 2pm, I will meet with General Keene at our
site(the Joint Task Force Commander). These two men control resources including landing
slots, medivac, security, logistics, etc. to which we have been denied access. This has
totally paralyzed our magnificent rescue/rebuild operation. As the US has taken more control
of these efforts, we have been increasingly neutralized. We do have the total support of the
Haitian Government as President Preval and his First Lady Elisabeth visit our camp daily. We
were not even able to bring in our senior Florida Senator this weekend who has strongly
supported our efforts. Please help UM/Project Medishare help Haiti. Our only motive is to
serve!
  Sincerely,
   Barth
