HRC

I spoke yesterday to Diana Taylor (she had reached out to Maggie indicating she wanted to speak to you; I advised you
had already left so Maggie directed her to me).

She was calling, after expressing how great our team had been on the scheduling and organizing of this matter, to
express how important it was for them that you be there and how grateful she was that you had committed.

I said we were excited, it had been on our dance card for a while, that you were looking forward to it and that I would
revert and checking to confirm nothing had changed.

You are scheduled to return from the China SCA trip on Wednesday, 9 May. I want to flag this for you b/c we told them
it's looked good (a 75% go with their organizer Ana) and we should lock this now after Diana's call or, if we want wiggle
room, it may make the most sense for you to call. I told her I would get back to her today.

Any concerns?
