 JERUSALEM (AP) - Israeli police say they have urged Jerusalem's city hall to cancel some results from a
recent local election after a group of ultra-Orthodox Jews prevented some women from voting.
   TV video showed a group of ultra-Orthodox Jews screaming at a few dozen women at a polling station and
then pushing them away. Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said police at the scene saw "a large
number" of women obstructed from voting.
   Rosenfeld said Friday police are investigating the incident, the latest attempt by extremely pious Jews to try
impose their practices on others.
   Jerusalem city hall denies there was any abuse at the poll and insists women voted freely.
