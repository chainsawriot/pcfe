Dear Secretary Clinton,

Thank you again for all your encouragement and help with DoD. I met with Michele's other deputy yesterday,
and we had a productive discussion about Iran and developments in maritime Asia. We also discussed contract
vehicles and mapped out what we need to do so that we can go to work! I am very grateful for everything you
have done. Yrs, Jackie
