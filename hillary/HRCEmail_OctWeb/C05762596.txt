Subject                           Insulza



Our ambo in Honduras reports that Insulza's solo mission has hit a snag:




Just got a call from the OAS Rep Jorge Miranda saying that regime Foreign Minister Ortez Colindres showed up at the
airport VIP lounge insisting that he would be welcoming the Sec General. Miranda told him that Insulza did not want to
meet with him, but Ortez refused to leave. Miranda said that he had called the Cardinal who called Micheletti, but that
Ortez refused to back down. The current situation is therefore that if Ortez does not budge, Insulza will not get off the
plane. He may wait a while but will likely continue on to DC.

during the campaign.
