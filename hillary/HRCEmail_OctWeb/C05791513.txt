Dear colleagues,

as you had suggested in our Brussels meeting on 1 December 2011 I travelled to Belgrade yesterday
to meet Pres. Tadic, his Head of Office, Mr. Rakic, Foreign Policy Adviser Ratkovic, negociator
Stefanovic and FM Jeremic.

I explained to all of them that the Chancellor was very sincere in her support on Serbia gaining
candidate status at the March European Council. There would be no moving of goalposts. HavincB1  ,
coordinated with Robert before, I explained in detail what Serbia had to accomplish in the com    • -1 r°

two months on the three critical issues: implementation of dialogue agreements, regional cooper           )
cooperation with EULEX and KFOR. I praised the arrest of Veselinovic as a positive signal.

I told all interlocutors that most of the homework was of a technical nature and should not create
domestic problems.
