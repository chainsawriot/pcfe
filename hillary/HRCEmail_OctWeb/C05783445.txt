Subject: Palestinians to push for UN membership Nov. 11 (AP)

GENEVA - (AP) A senior Palestinian envoy says diplomats are trying to muster support for a U.N. Security
Council vote Nov. 11 on Palestinian membership of the global body.
  The Palestinian envoy to the U.N. in Geneva, Ibrahim Khraishi, says he is hopeful of getting the necessary
backing of nine of the Security Council's 15 members.
  Khraishi told The Associated Press on Thursday that "several parties are working" to secure the votes, but
declined to elaborate.
  Diplomats said earlier this week that a Security Council committee considering the membership bid would
produce a report for ambassadors on Nov. 11 and they would then decide on next steps.
  The United States, Israel's closest ally, has pledged to use its veto if a majority of Security Council members
back Palestinian membership.
