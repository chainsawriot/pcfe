Jake and Huma,

Special Envoy Stern is asking the Secretary and Deputy Secretary Steinberg to reach out to 10 countries in advance of the
Copenhagen Conference. He would like the calls to be done by early next week, but three of the calls overlap with other
calls the Secretary may make over the weekend — Brazil, South Africa, and Saudi Arabia.

Since the Secretary is scheduled to speak to the Brazilian FM tomorrow at 9:30, they sent this call sheet first. I spoke to
D(S) staff, who said Special Envoy Stern may have briefed about this at one of the recent morning meetings. Unless the
Secretary does not want to combine these topics in the calls tomorrow, I'll send along Saudi Arabia and South Africa
climate change points when we receive them.

Thanks,
Courtney

                                            The Secretary's Call Sheet for
                                      Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim
                                              [SEL-so ah-more-REEN1
                                                        TBD

Purpose of Call: To request that Brazil: (1) support a "politically binding" agreement in Copenhagen; (2)
agree to inscribe their robust domestic actions in this agreement; and (3) to submit their actions to international
review.

•    Copenhagen Accord on Climate Change: The White House just announced that, in the context of an
     overall deal in Copenhagen, the President is prepared to put forward a U.S. emissions reduction target in the
     range of 17 percent below 2005 levels in 2020, in line with final U.S. legislation.

•    Danish PM Rasmussen has proposed a "politically binding" operational agreement that would cover all the
     main issues. We support this proposal, and we hope you will too. It is not a substitute for a legal
     agreement, but will advance such an agreement. The alternative — to call for negotiations to continue,
     recognizing that we have not finished — would be viewed as a failure.

•   We welcome the strong statements and commitments Brazil has made, including your announcements on
    forests and overall climate mitigation. It will be critical that you incorporate your policies and goals in the
    Copenhagen Accord and allow these actions to be internationally reviewed.

•   Brazil has taken a leadership role in these negotiations and we hope you will continue to push other
    countries, including other major developing economies, toward a successful outcome. It will be very
    important for China to put forward robust actions beyond business-as-usual that are subject to international
    review.

Courtney,

I've attached a call sheet on climate change for the Secretary's call with Brazil's Minister of External Relations. Please let
me know if you have any questions or concerns.

I'm copying Paul Brown, who has kindly agreed to work up call sheets for Saudi Arabia and South Africa. He will not be
able to get to this for another hour or so.

We'll discuss division of countries with Steinberg's staff and get back to you with a proposal.

Thanks,

Christo
