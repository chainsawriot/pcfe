Subject: China replaces once-powerful boss of Chongqing (AP)


BEIJING - (AP) China says the powerful head of the city of Chongqing, Bo Xilai, has resigned amid a
scandal involving his former police chief. He was among the country's most flamboyant politicians and the
apparent end of his career raises questions about the Communist Party's plans for a smooth succession this year.
  A Xinhua News Agency report posted on the government's website Thursday said Bo had been replaced by
Zhang Dejiang as the city's Communist Party secretary.
  Bo's exit blows open the competition for seats on the party's all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee.
Seven of its nine members are due to be replaced at the party's national congress this fall.
