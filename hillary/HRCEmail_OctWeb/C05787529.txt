Hi Cheryl,
Freddy said he saw you this morning at breakfast and that you'll be coming to              dinner.
So happy I'll get to see you.
Since you're seeing the Secretary this morning, I was hoping you might ask if she'd be free to join us.
It's a small dinner- about 20 people - should be lovely.
xoxo,
Tommy

It's such an extraordinary program.
