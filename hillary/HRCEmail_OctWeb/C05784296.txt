Subject: Fighters encircle Gaddafi son's presumed refuge-NTC (Reuters)

LONDON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Libyan revolutionary fighters are surrounding an area where a fugitive son of
Muammar Gaddafi, Saif al-Islam, is believed to have taken refuge, a military commander of the interim
National Transitional Council (NTC) said on Sunday.

   The commander, Abdel Majid Mlegta, told Reuters fighters were deploying around a place south of the town
of Bath Walid where they believed Saif al-Islam was hiding following his flight from his father's hometown of
Sirte on Thursday.

   Bani Walid, 150 km (100 miles) southwest of Tripoli, fell to NTC forces earlier this month after putting up
determined resistance for several weeks. Saif al-Islam was widely reputed to have been based in the town
during its resistance, before moving to Sirte.

    Mlegta said Gaddafi's Niger-based security chief Abdullah al-Senussi had been in contact with Saif al-Islam
to try to help him escape and flee to the Sahelian country "but our brigades are encircling this area south of Bani
Walid."

   Mlegta added without elaborating that NTC fighters had searched offices recently used by Saif al-Islam and
had found material indicating that he had been researching areas south of Bath Walid include places called
Wadi Zam Zam and Wadi al-Mandoum.
