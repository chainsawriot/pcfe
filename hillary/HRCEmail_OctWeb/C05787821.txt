Subject: My whereabouts today

I am out of the office today, en route now to New Haven. I'm giving a talk at the Law School, seeing my old profs and
President Levin, and eating some pizza. Will be on my blackberry and generally available, save for flying time this am
(730-850).

I'll be back in the office tomorrow and Sun - so much to do!
