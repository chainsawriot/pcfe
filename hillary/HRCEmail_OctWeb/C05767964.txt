Subject:                           RE: Lavrov call



A few quick updates:

-- India: I spoke four times to Natl Sec Advisor Menon over the past couple days, and we have completed nuclear
reprocessing agreement, as you promised PM Singh we would do late last year. US negotiating team on ground (led by
Dick Stratford of ISN) and Tim Roemer deserve the credit. We need to conform texts and prepare for Congressional
briefings before going public, but this is important step.

-- Turkey: Thanks again for your call to Berman, and FT statement. Jim Jeffery reports reaction in Turkey is tough, but
so far along lines of previous episodes. FM made public statement keeping door open on Armenia. Gul conversation
with Pres two days ago                     My Turkish counterpart still plans to go to Yerevan next week.

-- Indonesia: Call sheet is on its way to you for call to FM               H is working to arrange your talk with Sen Leahy
next week re Kopassus.

-- Russia: Followed up with Amb Kislyak and DFM Ryabkov on your call with Lavrov.



All best,

Bill

Lavrov thanked me for sending Ellen to Geneva and was delighted to hear she would be back on the 9th and would stay
until we reached agreement. You can read the memcon for more details.
