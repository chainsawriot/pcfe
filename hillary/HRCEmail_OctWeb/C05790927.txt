You both may be interested in the French "apology" to me and Davutoglu's comments.

Subject: S (and HbJ) unwitting public intervention in Paris

Ok, many of you may ask, or may be asked, how was it that S's internal intervention at the Ad Hoc Syria meeting in Paris
ended up being broadcast live? Good question. This intervention was never intended to be public. Now it is.

The French told us that only Juppe's openings would be open to the media, besides, of course, Juppe's media availability
at the end of the event. That's what the French told Embassy Paris, S's advance, protocol folks, etc. So that's how the
planning on our side went. S's intervention was drafted on that basis.

In fact, as it turns out, the microphones, cameras, and thus public broadcasting continued past Juppe's opening to
include both Qatari PM/FM HbJ's remarks and those of the Secretary. After that, the cameras and public microphones
were at last turned off. (Burhan Ghalioun was the fourth speaker, and then Juppe went around to the others, in 1.4(B)
protocol order.)                                                                                                   1.4(D)
                                                                                                                   B1
Those of us inside the room did not know what happened until later. Obviously, those listening outside, including the
media, were quite aware.

In any case, S didn't stay for the media gathering but left immediately for the airport, despite the frantic and incessant
French requests she stay to sit on the podium.
