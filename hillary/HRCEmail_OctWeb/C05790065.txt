Subject:                                Warren Buffett



Hi Madame Secretary,
I just wanted to tell you that Warren Buffett is here today for the Microsoft CEO Summit; he asked me who I worked for
before I worked for Bill. When I told him it was YOU, he said "she's my heroine!" Then I laughed and he said, "no — she
really is!"
We all feel that way © Hope you are well.

Lauren
