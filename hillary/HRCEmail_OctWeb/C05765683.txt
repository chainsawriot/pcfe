nice - we're   putting together a press statement.

The churn on the hill is lots of enthusiasm, despite the young age. He will be a good antidote to some of the
stagnancy currently plaguing the agency and will hopefully have a mandate to fundamentally change the way
business is done over there. Some are concerned that his young age may work against him, especially in the
interagency context or even in his dealings with State.. .we're hoping he can cobble together a strong coalition to
support a strengthened, independent agency that will coordinate with State but remain institutionally separate
from State. Also hear from agriculture committee staff that he's done a great job thus far, and very well
respected.
