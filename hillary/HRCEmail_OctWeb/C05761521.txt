Cheryl,

     We followed up with WHA after you mentioned the Secretary's interest in stopping in Haiti on the way
home from the Summit of the Americas. As you see below, WHA is concerned about the timing, given likely
nationwide elections on April 19, and would prefer that the Secretary travel there at a later date. Do you
want us to task something formal with regard to a later visit? Dan

Dan and Paul,

We suggest the Secretary find a different time to travel to Haiti. April 19th should see nationwide elections that will strain
the resources of both the Haitian government and the Embassy. It may be difficult and certainly disruptive to line up
useful meetings for the Secretary with Haitian officials, and the Embassy would need to scale back its observer operations
to support her visit. Our top priority now is a successful vote.




Please let me know if you need a more detailed response.

Dave Robinson
