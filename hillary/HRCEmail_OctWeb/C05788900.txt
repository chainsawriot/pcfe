Jake,

Jeremy said you took note of the Islamist protests and asked for an assessment. Here's my quick
take.-Andrew



Islamist forces do not command nation-wide support and probably do not represent a direct political
threat to the TNC, but their advanced battlefield experience and access to weaponry could pose a
significant military challenge.

    •    The Islamists are not particularly popular outside of certain areas of eastern Libya. Sallabi and
         his followers are as vilified as Jibril in much of the country. Indeed, many of the political groups
         that oppose Jibril, such as those centered in Misrata, view the Islamists with equal, if not, more
         hostility.
    •    Both Islamist and secular militias have operated with relative restraint so far. With Sirte and Bani
         Walid still in regime hands and Qadhafi on the loose, there is enough of a rationale to support
         continued cooperation.
    •    However, once operations against Qadhafi and the regime are wrapped up, this force for
         unity is likely to dissipate. It is at this point that militias, including the Islamists, will probably
         abandon caution and pursue a more aggressive campaign for power, perhaps including
         violence.

Even though the Islamists may not be able to displace the TNC, Jibril and his allies suffer from a serious
credibility problem. If the TNC fails to make strides in giving other political movements (in Tripoli,
Misrata, Zintan, and elsewhere) a real role in governance, it may find itself without, a viable national
political base.
