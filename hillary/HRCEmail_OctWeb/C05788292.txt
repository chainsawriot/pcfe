Hi Wenchi,
PNG finally got the 22 womens bill passed in parliament so PNG women are just over the moon. It is a huge achievement
and we are looking at 22 seats in parliament next year.

Since I came back I have been very actively involved in with women enterpreuners in both formal and informal so lots of
support coming through now for women My Participation at APEC has pushed to another level. I did another
presentation for the pacific women in Fiji last week and gave them a copy of the San Francisco Declaration to them all.

I have initiated a pacific women's expo in PNG next year and I would like to invite Miss Verveer to come and open it in
march from the 1-4 march so could you advise if she would be able to come?
It will be a huge boost if she will come and if not the someone from the state govt please. Kindly advise

PNG will be advocating Women's Economic Empowerment through Vital Voices advocacy programme after our vanuatu
workshop so it will boost and strengthen our drive to get policies through to the govt so her coming will be very good.
Please do let me know so that we can send formal invitation




regards



janet
