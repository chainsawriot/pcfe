Subject                            RE: Request for S call to Talabani Re: Heads-up on condolence calls to Maliki today



I sent Oscar the call sheet but its pasted below as well. I will tell ops to reach out to zebari now and connect to berry.

Purpose of Call: To express condolences and support at the horrific double car bombings in Baghdad today that targeted
the Ministry of Justice and the Baghdad Provincial Council. Latest casualties — 132 dead and many more wounded.

•       Please accept my sincere condolences at the senseless and despicable bombings today.

o       Clearly this is an effort to set back the impressive progress that Iraq has been making. We stand ready to help
you in any way to investigate these attacks and to help bring the perpetrators to justice.

•       More broadly, we remain steadfast in supporting Iraqi progress and stability as you enter this critical period
leading up to the elections.

•      (If Raised) The dispatch of a UN Envoy appears more pertinent than ever. We will continue to support an
appropriate effort from the UN.

Background: Today's bombings at the Justice Ministry and Baghdad Provincial Council have a parallel with the August 19
attacks against the Foreign and Finance Ministries; they represent the second time in three months that vehicle-borne
explosives targeted the institutions of the Iraqi Government. This is likely again an attack by Al-Qaeda in Iraq, but the
Iraqis are likely also to blame the Ba'athist old regime opposition, many of whom reside in Syria. Our prompt expression
of condolence and support signal U.S. engagement; the Iraqis had expressed disappointment earlier that we were not
more supportive of their call for a UN investigation into the earlier bombings. [Note: We understand four American
security contractors were injured in the bombings, one seriously.]
