 Hillary-

 It was great to see you for a bit at Thanksgiving and hope we can find some time soon to catch up.

 I am writing to ask if you'd be interested in speaking at the Truman National Security Project's annual conference from
 May 4th to the 6th?
 It is an incredible organization and network of our nation's young foreign and domestic policy leaders (I am a little biased
 as a Truman fellow). This group is filled with smart, pragmatic, and idealistic young leaders from across the nation and I
 consider myself incredibly
 fortunate to be a part of it. I think you will really enjoy getting
 to spend a little time with some of them.

  I've attached aletter with more info from Rachel Kleinfeld, the CEO and founder, who I think you've met a few times
  before.

  Hope your trip is going well and know that you makeall of us so proud.

  Love and best, Zach
