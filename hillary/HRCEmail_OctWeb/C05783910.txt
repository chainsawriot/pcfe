Subject: UN, activists urge inquiry into Gaddafi death (Reuters)

GENEVA, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The United Nations and human rights groups called on Friday for a full
investigation into the death of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and voiced concerns that he may have been
executed, a war crime under international law.

   Images filmed on mobile phones before and after Gaddafi's death showed him wounded and bloodied but
clearly alive after his capture in his hometown of Sirte on Thursday, and then dead amidst a jostling crowd of
anti-Gaddafi fighters.

   "If you take these two videos together, they are rather disturbing because you see someone who has been
captured alive and then you see the same person dead," U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville told
Reuters Television.

   Asked whether Gaddafi may have been executed, he said: "It has to be one possibility when you look at
these two videos. So that's something that an investigation needs to look into."

    Under the Geneva Conventions which lay down the rules of conduct in armed conflict, it is prohibited to
torture, humiliate or murder detainees.

   The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which upholds respect for the 1949 pacts, said it had
no information on Gaddafi's death. "In general, a captured person must be treated correctly," an ICRC
spokesman said.

   Russia believes that Gaddafi should have been treated as a prisoner of war according to the Geneva
Conventions and should not have been killed, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Friday, calling for an
investigation.

   "If Colonel Gaddafi was killed after his capture, it would constitute a war crime and those responsible should
be brought to justice," Claudio Cordone, senior director at Amnesty International, said in a statement.

  Peter Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch, interviewed by CNN in Sirte near the drainage ditch where
Gaddafi was captured, said: "We do not think he was caught in crossfire. Did Muammar Gaddafi die from
wounds or did he receive a fatal head wound after he left this area?

   "We are calling for an autopsy and an investigation. This is a blemish on the new Libya that he died under
suspicious circumstances," he said.

   Some 95 bodies were found after Libyan transitional forces took Gaddafi's besieged hometown, including
several bodies executed with gunshots to the head, according to Bouckaert.

   Gaddafi's body lay in an old meat store on Friday as arguments swirled over his burial and the circumstances
of his death.

   With a bullet wound visible through the familiar curly hair, the corpse shown to Reuters in Misrata bore other
marks of the violent end to a violent life that was being broadcast to the world in snatches of grainy, gory
cellphone video.

  A television station based in Syria that supported Gaddafi said on Friday that the slain Libyan leader's wife
had asked for a U.N. investigation into his death.
