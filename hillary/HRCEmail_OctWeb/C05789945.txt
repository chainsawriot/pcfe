Madame Secretary

It would be good to specifically link the cookstove tour you are doing with Dai to the Chinese joining the Global Alliance
for Clean Cookstoves.

During the tour it would be great to thank Dai for joining the Alliance and then you can acknowledge their entry at the
Eco-Partners event.

Thnx

Kris
