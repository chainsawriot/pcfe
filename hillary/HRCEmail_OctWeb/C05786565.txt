First of all, Happy Birthday! I hope you are getting some well deserved R and R today because your schedule tires me
out just seeing it on television!

And thank you for your kind wishes and offer of help. I may ask your press shop for some small assistance in the next
week. But much more importantly, I hope you will share with us your ideas on all issues, including economic and
domestic - no one better understands the environment and the levers to change it than you. I realize you have a few
things that keep you busy (and I know that will remain true even when you're a "former"), but I also remember sitting in
the living room of the White House two days before President Bush's inauguration, plotting the creation of a progressive
think tank with you. So to the extent we can tap into your strategic brilliance because after all, this was all you idea -
well, I know how lucky we would be.

Gratefully,

Neera

Dear Neera,

  I am so happy for you, for CAP and for the progressive agenda we both care so much about. After John mentioned
your becoming President following my speech (and thanks for your kind comments), I waited from afar (seven countries
in seven days...)for an official announcement. Finally, today it came. And well-deserved it is. CAP couldn't have done
better, and I look forward to watching w pride and telling people, "I knew her when...."

  If I can ever be of help--now or when I become a "former"-- please just ask.

 All the best to you and CAP, H
