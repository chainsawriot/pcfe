I think you should do this.

Cheryl: I hope all is well. I wanted to raise with you again the idea of the Secretary coming to MCC for a town hall-style
meeting. Our staff would be thrilled to have her. An event could be as short or as long as the Secretary would like, and
we can make anytime work.

Please let me know what the next steps for this might be.

Best,
Daniel
