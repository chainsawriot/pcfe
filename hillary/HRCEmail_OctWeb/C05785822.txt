Just a few updates.
Reminder on lovenox.
You will still have time at hotel to change when you land.
Reminder Cathedral will be very cold - no heating.
There are no serviceable restrooms inside.
No interpretation, but english transcripts for everything will be on seats.
Reminder family canceled reception. Klaus is hosting a reception for 1,000 people after funeral. Its on schedule as an fyi
but you are not expected to go. You can see widow at cathedral.
One unresolved issue is there will be no staff access to the cathedral at all. They are including penny who is technically
leading the delegation staffing, jon davidson, monica, anyone. Really just norm eisen allowed in. So we are working on it.
