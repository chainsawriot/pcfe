Subject: Any chance to take advantage of this opportunity??? TIME SENSITIVE

All:
Pardon this somewhat broadcast email, which given your schedules may not even register, but I spotted
reference to HRC being in London and wanted to flag that the Skoll Foundation World Forum on Social
Entrepreneurship runs 3/30-4/1 in Oxford, with all the entrepreneurs supported by Skoll meeting in advance
3/29-30. If there is any chance I-IRC could fit an Oxford stop into her itinerary, Skoll would jump through hoops
to bring together an audience that would be high value for her/State objectives. HRC expressed interest in 2009
in speaking at this Forum. She has a standing invitation, but it did not work out to accept in either 2010-or 2011.
A glance at the cast of social entrepreneurs supported by Skoll underscores the relevance to current urgent
needs for innovation and partnership in advancing access to economic opportunity and peace globally. The
leaders Skoll convenes in Oxford span the globe and their work is both effective and moving to scale. This
would be a great venue to advance the impact investment and Middle East peace messages, among others.

Thanks for any consideration you may be able to give this recommendation. I can provide contact information if
this is at all a possibility.

Best regards,

Jan
