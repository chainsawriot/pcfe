Subject: Turkey: no call yet for foreign aid after quake (Reuters)



ANKARA, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Turkey has not yet made any call for international assistance after Sunday's
powerful earthquake in which many people were feared killed, a Foreign Ministry official said.

   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Turkey had received offers of assistance from
dozens of countries, including Israel, and so far had declined help from all of them.

    Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak said earlier that Ankara had declined aid offered by the Jewish state
after the 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck southeast Turkey.
