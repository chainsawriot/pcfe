Subject: Bombings in eastern Baghdad kill 3 (AP)

BAGHDAD - (AP) Iraqi officials say a triple bombing in the capital has killed at least three people.
   Police in the Shiite neighborhood of Sadr City in eastern Baghdad say the first bomb exploded near a small
restaurant Thursday evening.
   Minutes later another bomb went off near a police patrol that had just arrived at the scene, shortly followed
by a third blast in the same area near bystanders and police.
   Police say 14 people were wounded in the attack. A hospital official in Sadr City confirmed the casualties.
   The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they aren't authorized to brief the media.
   Violence has dropped dramatically in Iraq since the height of the conflict but attacks still happen regularly.
