I had several conversations with Cameron Munter last week. He mentioned that he had discussed with you the
possibility of having a high level DoS review of the current Pakistan strategy. Just wanted you to know that I would be
happy to participate and/or help move that forward in any way I can . It is unquestionably one of the most frustrating
situations I have ever encountered. The stakes are so high and yet there are no clear paths forward or end in sight to the
challenges we face.




Let me know if there is anything you would like me to do.
