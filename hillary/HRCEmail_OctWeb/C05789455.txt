Appointment of Ambassador Ertharin Cousin as Executive Director
of the World Food Programme

Press Statement
Hillary Rodham Clinton
Secretary of State
Washington, DC
January 17, 2012



I am delighted to congratulate Ambassador Ertharin Cousin on her appointment by United Nations Secretary-
General Ban Ki-moon and Food and Agriculture Organization Director General Jose Graziano da Silva to serve
as the next Executive Director of the World Food Programme.

For over 50 years, the World Food Programme has played a vital role in reducing global hunger, poverty and
undernutrition worldwide, providing assistance to millions of men, women, and children in desperate need.

It has been an honor to support Ambassador Cousin's work as U.S. Ambassador and Permanent Representative
to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture in Rome, where she has been central to designing and
implementing our country's food security policies. I am confident that she will continue to be a powerful voice
in the global fight against hunger and lend her energy, optimism and experience to the World Food Programme.
