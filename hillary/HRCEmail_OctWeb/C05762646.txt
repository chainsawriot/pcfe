Subject: PRESIDENT OBAMA on SECRETARY CLINTON

--PRESIDENT OBAMA on SECRETARY CLINTON, in a written pre-trip interview:

NOVAYA GAZETA, an opposition Moscow newspaper: 'In the course of your presidential campaign, you competed with
Hillary Clinton. Does this hinder your joint work now?'

THE PRESIDENT: 'Absolutely not. This is the beauty of democracy. Secretary Clinton and I engaged in a hard-fought, very
competitive race for the nomination of our party. By the way, without question, these primaries made me a better
candidate for the general election against Senator John McCain. But in democracies, once the election is over, then all
Americans who care about our country get back to work. It was because of how well I got to know Secretary Clinton
during our campaign that I knew she would be such an excellent Secretary of State, and she has served our country with
excellence.'
