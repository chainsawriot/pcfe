NBC Buys Comedy About The First Family From
Josh Gad, Jason Winer & Jon Lovett
By NELLIE ANDREEVA I Monday October 24, 2011 @ 12:00pm PDT




                                                  rom NBC, the network that brought us The West Wing, comes
1600 Penn, a family comedy set at the White House. The network bought pre-emptively the single-camera
comedy, from Book Of Mormon star Josh Gad, Modern Family director Jason Winer and former speechwriter to
President Barack Obama Jon Lovett, with a put pilot commitment. Gad, Winer and Lovett co-created together
the project, about a dysfunctional family that just happens to live at the most famous address in America. 20th
Century Fox TV where Winer is under an overall deal, is producing. The idea originated with Winer and long-
time friend Gad bouncing around possible series premises until they settled on the First Family comedy setup.
They knew they needed a writer and turned to 20th TV. Conveniently, the studio had signed a script deal with
Lovett who had taken meetings indicating that he wanted to get into the half-hour scripted comedy business.
20th TV got the trio together and they honed in the idea for 1600 Penn. All 3 will executive produce, with
Lovett writing the script and Winer attached to direct. In addition to 1600 Penn, Gad is writing and executive
producing another comedy project for NBC, about a family on the road, through Universal TV and Will Ferrell
and Adam McKay's Gary Sanchez. He is with ICM and Brillstein Entertainment. Lovett is with CAA and
Mosaic.
