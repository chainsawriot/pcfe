Phil, you really pulled it off. The members were locked in on your presentation and the accompanying material,
and there were quite a few references back to your briefing during the course of the day. My only regret is that
those Kim guys in Pyongyang, once again, managed to complicate our lives. You were both efficient and
gracious in truncating the briefing so that Kurt could do his thing. Anyway, I've got some sense of how you
had to scramble in recent days, which makes me all the more grateful to you and your colleagues. Hope you get
a little rest of the holidays, and I'd like to catch up with you in less pressed circumstances before too long. S.

PS: There was a hilarious moment at the end of the evening. I wanted to take my Brookings pals, Lexi and
John-Michael, down to the 7th floor to see my old office — and yours — in D. They'd already been issued their
building passes, but I hadn't gotten mine. So the DS agent in charge of the S elevator said I could only go if
escorted by them! They got rather a kick out of that, and I gotta admit, so did I. And so will Toria, which is
why I'm adding her to this e-mail.
