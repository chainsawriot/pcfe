Thursday and Friday are very light -- essentially you would miss Lisa Caputo's lunch, Dave Stone's service on Thursday
Nothing on Friday.
As for Wednesday, they are scheduling a PC from 5-6:30pm (at least we have been told to hold that time). That is the
last item on your schedule that day.

What happens to my schedule if I have to go to Copenhagen, probably Wed-Fri?
