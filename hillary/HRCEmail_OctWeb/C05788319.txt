Subject: Russian ship reappears near Turkish port (AP)


ANKARA, Turkey - (AP) Authorities say a Russian ship suspected of delivering weapons to Syria has
anchored off Turkey's coast.
   A Foreign Ministry official said Turkish coast guard and customs officials would board the Chariot on
Saturday before allowing it to dock at the port of Iskenderun. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in
line with government rules.
   The ship had made an unscheduled stop in Cyprus, technically violating an EU embargo on arms shipments
to Syria. Cypriot authorities allowed it to leave Wednesday after the ship's owners said it would not head for
Syria.
   Turkey, citing navy intelligence, said the ship nevertheless made its way to the Syrian port of Tartus after
leaving Cyprus.
   U.S. officials said Friday they had expressed concerns to both Russia and Cyprus.
