Subject: Liberia poll to go ahead despite Tubman boycott -body (Reuters)



MONROVIA (Reuters) - The head of Liberia's election commission said on Friday a Nov. 8th run-off would go
ahead as planned, despite a boycott announced by Winston Tubman, who was due to take on President Ellen
Johnson-Sirleaf in the poll.

  "Nothing will stop the elections from going ahead as planned," election commission chief Elizabeth B.
Nelson told Reuters by telephone.

  Tubman said he would not take part in the election as the election commission was still flawed, despite
Nelson replacing the previous chief, and he could not legitimise a "corrupt political process".
