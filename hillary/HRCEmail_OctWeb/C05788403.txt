Subject: NBC interview taped this am

Toria did a terrific job, actually a fantastic job. She struck just the right tone, conveying forcefully the Secretary's no
tolerance policy and that S mandated that we fix problems, which we have been doing. Toria expressed great sympathy
with the victims and acknowledged we are not perfect and are working hard to do better — outlining the many steps we
have taken to improve the program. Toria also gave a nice riff on the value of the program. NBC reassured us they will
give Toria ample air time and will air the interviews with kids who have wonderful experiences as part of their
exchanges. NBC seemed fixated on one of the companies we work with — Educational Resource Development Trust
(ERDT). NBC questioned why we still use ERDT since ERDT failed to take appropriate actions in the 2005 case. We are
double checking with ECA on this one. Story will be ugly but Toria put us in a much better place and gave us the hook
for balancing the piece, a bit. We'll see on February 8.
