Hillary: Virginia Military Institute, George C. Marshall's school, through Pat Lang, would like to give you the Distinguished
Diplomat Award. See Pat's note below. Though you must receive endless invitations, I think this one would be a
particularly good venue for you for a host of obvious reasons, and where you could deliver a speech. You will have
various speeches to give. You can give one at VMI and get honored. You can respond through me or to Pat directly one
way or another. Also, I had a long conversation with Pat, who has many sources within the higher echelons of the military,
and he describes what the generals are doing on Afghanistan deployment as a "slow motion mutiny." He believes the
White House trying to counter it through press leaks as though this is a primary campaign generates contempt. Cheers,
Sid

Madame Secretary


I am a 1962 graduate of the Virginia Military Institute. VMI has always been predominately a hard science
and engineering school. I happen to have been an English major there. Today, there are more cadets with
a "major" or "minor" in International Kelations and rolitical Science than in any other field. The whole
student body is around 1 ZOO in number and deliberately kept to that size to keep 9uality up and to
continue to rely on a teaching system that is almost tutorial in nature.


The Institute's most revered alumnus is George C. Marshall. his library is there as well as a brand new
"Marshall Center for the 5tuc:ly of Leadership and Ethics."


I am a member of the advisory board of the "International Kelations and rolitical Science"
Department. The Institute (and the department) gives a prize from time to time to truly "Distinguished
Diplomats." Under that rubric have been included a few who were not strictly diplomats but who have
been of great service to the United States. Jim Lilley was a recipient as was Susan Eisenhower, last
year's recipient.


When I recently met with the 5uperintencient of VMI (my classmate), I told him that you would make an
admirable recipient for the "Distinguished Diplomat" award. he was very welcoming of the idea. You may
know him, General (ret.) JI-15 reay.

1 enclose a page from the VMI welpsite that described Ms.   Ej5e1-1110wer'5 awardl last ,9ear.

VMI now liaS a substantial number of women cadets. It seems to me that your presence there for this
purpose would be a great symbol and a vast encouragement for them.
