Hi Cheryl,




Could you let me know what is expected in terms of a Presidential announcement on detainees tomorrow, please? A
week or so ago, we had encouraged the WH to include us in planning for a roll-out, so that we could help them think
about (and manage) foreign government reactions, but we in L have not been involved to date.




Thanks,

Joan
