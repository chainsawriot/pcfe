See fairly upbeat assessment on UK/Australia defense trade treaties. Looks like we could get a draft Resolution
of Ratification by the end of this week. I still think ratification is a way off, however, probably well into April
at the earliest. In the interim, we are pressing Kerry and Lugar for public statements of support.

Spoke to Ed Levine today to follow up on Friday's briefing, address the few take-backs we owed them, and ask
about their timeline for providing us with the resolution of ratification.

First, Ed said that he thought Friday's briefing accomplished what he had hoped â€” that we were able to
exhaust the Committee's questions and address all other outstanding concerns. Right now, the Majority staff
is in the process of making final tweaks to a draft resolution of ratification. They expect to march down the
hall to the Minority very soon and negotiate with them on the draft text. I expressed our wish to receive the
draft resolution before POTUS leaves on his trip on the 18th, to show momentum that Senate consideration is
moving forward. Ed said that he expect the Committee to meet that timeline and hopes to provide State
with an agreed upon draft resolution by the end of this week/early next week.

Second, I asked if Senator Kerry would consider making some sort of public statement in support of the
Treaties prior to the POTUS visit to Australia. He said that was a fair request and he would kick around the
idea with his colleagues of inserting a floor statement into the Congressional Record.

Finally, I should just mention that Ed stressed twice how much he hoped that once the resolution is provided
to the State, that we would be able to agree to most of the text. Obviously, I said that would depend on what
it looked like. He understood, but just wanted folks to know that the heavy lifting is occurring in the
Committee now (between the Majority and Minority) and once the Committee acts on it, he expects little
controversy on the floor.
