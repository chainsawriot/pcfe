Subject: Kobler's report from MEK/Paris meeting

Kobler contacted me to convey highlights of his Paris meetings, which are continuing:

-- much MEK angst and posturing, specifically about Kobler's "betrayal" at having signed the
MOU without their agreement. His answer: lives are at stake, and the GOI met the
principles
of relocation and repatriation.

- Rajavi claimed that she has lost her grip over the Ashrafis (Kobler doubts that). She
asked for a letter from Kobler to the Ashrafis explaining the MOU (Kobler is preparing it).

- Kobler reviewed the GOI response to the MEK "minimum assurances" demand. He did so
(including the GOI insistence on police presence inside Liberty and no formal revocation of
the warrants. The MEK seemed resigned to the Iraqi police presence, but wants to discuss
details (perhaps later). They agree to postpone discussion of property questions.

- - biggest problem is question of safety/ guarantees of those facing arrest (the
"120".   Kobler explained that UN's ability to help is limited. (But Fayyad earlier told
Kobler and repeated to Jim Jeffrey today that the GOI would not act on the warrants if the
deal were moving forward. We will find a way to convey this to the MEK.)

- - in sum, Rajavi did not reject MOU outright, but is still haggling.
