Subject: Mayor Bloomberg going to Vietnam

Mayor Bloomberg is going to be in Vietnam on March 23. His Foundation has been funding a major program
there with the WHO since 2007 around road safety â€”saving lives by increasing helmet use and decreasing
drinking and driving. He would like to have a dinner/lunch/meeting with the Prime Minister while he is there
to discuss the program. Is there someone at State who help facilitate a connection? Thank you!
