Subject: South Sudan kicks out president of oil company (AP)

JUBA (AP) - Officials say the head of the largest foreign oil company in South Sudan has been asked to leave
the country over allegations he conspired with Sudan to steal the south's oil.
   Elizabeth James Bol, South Sudan's deputy minister of petroleum and mining, said February 22 that Liu
Yingcai, a Chinese national and the president of the Petrodar Operating Company, was notified February 20 that
he had 72 hours to leave the country.
   Petrodar is a consortium of oil firms operating in South Sudan that includes the national oil corporations of
China and Malaysia. Petrodar did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
   Yingcais' ouster comes in the midst of a bitter and expensive fight over oil between Sudan and South Sudan.
