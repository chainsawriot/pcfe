Cherylâ€”

I wanted to let you know that I've accepted a position at Dartmouth, where I'll be director of the Dickey Center for
International Understanding and have an academic appointment. Per earlier conversation with Jake about the
Secretary's wish that I stay on as long as possible, as well as my own desire to push forward some of CT's key projects
through the end of the term, I will start in Hanover on or about January 1, 2013.

The Acting President of Dartmouth is eager to make an announcement of the appointment this month. I had consulted
earlier with L about this, and they had no objections. Do you have any problem with that? Please let me know.

I will let the Secretary know about my plans tomorrow.

Bests,

DB
