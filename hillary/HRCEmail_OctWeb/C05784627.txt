Subject: Brits and Egypt

Geoffrey Adams called this morning wanting to make sure we were well coordinated on Egypt. Brits are sending a senior
military for consultations but are concerned that highest leaderships is discredited. Brits had seen WH statement and
will message accordingly. Urged their ambassador on ground to stay in close touch with Anne (assume already the case)
and told Geoffrey would check in this morning for any further suggestions for Brits and be back to him today if more.
