Subject: Arab League to hold emergency session on Syria (AP)


CAIRO - (AP) The Arab League will convene an emergency session on Syria to discuss the country's failure
to end bloodshed caused by government crackdowns on civil protests.
   Protesters across Syria want the Arab League to suspend the country's membership at the meeting in Cairo on
Saturday.
   This would be a powerful symbolic blow to a nation that prides itself on being a powerhouse of Arab
nationalism.
   The U.N. estimates some 3,500 people have been killed in the Syrian crackdown since the uprising against
the authoritarian rule of President Bashar Assad began eight months ago, inspired by the revolutions in Egypt
and Tunisia.
   Although the crackdown has led to broad international isolation, President Bashar Assad appears to have a
firm grip on power.
