Subject: pls clear - statment on Alice Pickering

Attached and pasted below.

I was deeply saddened by the passing of Alice Pickering, wife of former Ambassador Thomas Pickering. Like so many
members of the extended State Department family, Alice was deeply devoted to America's ideals, our values, and the
importance of service. For four decades, in posts ranging from Russia to El Salvador, she and Tom served the United
States with great distinction.

Tom once said of her, "Often I get the recognition, and she gets the tough jobs." But all of us who were lucky enough to
know Alice understood her commitment and appreciated her love for her family and her country. At every post, she
took special pride in nurturing the new Foreign Service staff and making sure their families felt at home.

On behalf of President Obama and all the women and men of the State Department, I offer my deepest condolences to
Tom; their children, Timothy and Margaret; and all their beloved family and friends.
