Subject: RE: Jesse Jackson call re: Syria

I called. A notetaker will write up the call. Rev Jackson said that he's been meeting with various
groups from Syria and he spoke with "the Syrian Ambassador" (meaning the Syrian Chargé, I
assume). Rev Jackson wants to go to Moscow and Damascus, to try to get the bloodshed to stop. I
encouraged the former and discouraged the latter, cautioning him that Bashar would distort his
message and play up the visit in a damaging well. I suggested as well that he speak to Kofi Annan,
especially given Annan's concern (as demonstrated in his press remarks) that there be a single point
of contact for negotiating with the regime. We don't want Bashar to play Annan and Jackson off
each other.

Rev Jackson also requested a meeting with S.

So I owe him a number to reach Kofi (which were tracking down) and an answer to his request to
meet with the Secretary.

Sir:

The Secretary asked if you could return on her behalf a call to Rev. Jesse Jackson, who called Thursday evening to report
on his meeting that day with the Syrian Charge. Would that be possible? If so, Jackson can be reached at
