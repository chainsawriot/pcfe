  Madam Secretary,
  I am sure Bill and Jake are filling you in but thought it important to summarize where I think we are before you talk with
  Cathy Ashton or, if you have already, what is state of play. I write from Delhi on my way to Patna in Bihar after breakfast
  with amb. Burleigh and Dr. Kim who is here today for meetings.

                                                                                                                                1.4(D)
                                                                                                                                B1
                                                                                                                                B5




  I can be reached through ops if you wish to discuss further. Very much appreciate your talking with Cathy to try to move
  forward.

  Best,
  Wendy
