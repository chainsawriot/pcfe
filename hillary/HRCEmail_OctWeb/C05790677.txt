Hi Cheryl. This is a little off the wall, but I am told that Sam Arora worked for Hillary at some point. I may be writing too
late anyway — I've been in meetings all day — but the people who are working the gay marriage bill in the Maryland
legislature think it would be helpful if someone could find an appropriate way to say to Mr. Arora on Hillary's behalf that
it would be great if he could vote for the bill. Thanks for whatever is possible. I realize it may be too much of a
reach. All best.

Professor,

It's been a while since I've been in touch, but I believe that hearing from a person with your knowledge and
experience will help push Sam in the right direction.

You might remember Sam Arora, a former classmate of mine, who is currently serving in the MD
Assembly. He campaigned vigorously for the support (and primarily money) of us liberals in DC, and openly
supported marriage equality. Then, when it came to a difficult vote last year, his support disappeared. Now,
according to friends who just met with him at his office, he is undecided. The vote in the Assembly is TODAY,
and, it's scary to say, but Sam may actually be the deciding vote.

If you have some time, please take a minute to remind him why a "Yes" vote is the right thing to do. His cell #
is             and his email is                     or

Hope you and your family are all doing well.

All the best,

Jon
