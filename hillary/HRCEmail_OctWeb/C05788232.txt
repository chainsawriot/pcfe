I checked and you did write to Anne-Marie on 11/5, before you received this e-mail and photo on 11/8.

Would you like me to prepare a thank you for the photo? Or will the note you already sent suffice?

I believe so; I'll double check when I get to the office today (and print/prepare responses for the other e-mails you just
forwarded).
