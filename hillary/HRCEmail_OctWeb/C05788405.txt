Lunch yesterday was a true treat; I will keep my menu as a lovely souvenir. Alexander was thrilled that you remembered
his chinchilla! I truly look forward to working with you on some legacy speeches, and will start by sending some notes
shortly on the ideas we discussed re Munich. I am truly frustrated that I cannot be there; Senator McCain invited me
today to be part of his delegation but I am committed to give a speech in Denver. I've also turned up a few new ideas re
Iran that I will send along this weekend.
All best, and many thanks again,
AM
