Subject: Envoy: Palestine continues pursuing UN membership (AP)

UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Palestinian U.N. observer Riyad Mansour says his country will employ new
creative ideas to gain membership at the world body despite a U.S. threat to veto such an action.
   Mansour said Friday he presented the current Security Council president with a four page letter detailing
Israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories and that the two discussed several ideas to gain U.N.
membership for his people.
   In September, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas took the quest for independence to U.N. headquarters,
sidestepping peace negotiating efforts that have foundered for nearly two decades. The U.S. and Israel object to
the move, insisting on a negotiated peace agreement first.
