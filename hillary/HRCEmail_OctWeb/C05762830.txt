                                                                                             Jack reported that he had
told the Somalia team that what they had produced in terms of creative solutions to get food into Somalia was totally
inadequate, and he had asked them to try again. He wanted them to look at options such as extraordinary means of
food delivery, moving people to the north, or relying more heavily on Kenya. He wants to review the material again well
in advance of the next meeting.




BUDGET




•     There will be a meeting with OMB and the NSC at 11:30 this morning on the FY 2011 budget. Jack voiced concern
that 1) OMB is looking at "offsets" that might not be real; and 2) that on the war side of the budget,

PUBLIC DIPLOMACY




     Cheryl indicated that Judith McHale has a proposal for a new structure for public diplomacy in the Department and
wanted to be sure Pat had reviewed it. Pat said he had seen it, as has Jack, and both like the approach, though Pat
noted some in the Department (especially the regional bureaus) may be less enthusiastic.




"HARD LANDING" IN JAMAICA




      The American Airlines plane that made a "hard landing" in Jamaica carried 73 Americans, a number of whom were
injured, although there were no fatalities. The flight originated in Washington and carried official and private
Americans. Embassy Kingston employees are on the scene and at the hospital to provide assistance.




GOLDMAN CASE




     Goldman's Brazilian attorney and the attorney for the Brazilian family are discussing a possible "voluntary"
handover of the boy to Mr. Goldman this morning. If that does not happen, Goldman will request an involuntary return.
An NBC jet is standing by to return Mr. Goldman and his son back to the U.S.




•      Rich said that the letter from the Secretary to Senator Lautenberg had not been delivered because Lautenberg's
staff had indicated it might not be sufficient to persuade him to lift his hold, but the letter now appears to be overtaken
by events in any event.




NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY




     Derek indicated that the Department will receive a draft of the National Security Strategy report early next month,
and we will have to set up a process to review it quickly. Jack stressed the need to ensure it was consistent with the
QDDR.




 LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS




      The Senate will likely approve the Iran sanctions legislation today or tomorrow. We will need to focus on the
 conference to obtain the changes we want.

      Rose will make a number of calls to key Senators to update them on the START negotiations. Rich noted that there
is anxiety over the "bridging" period before a new agreement takes effect.


                                                                                                                B6

     We expect all our nominees, except                       UN Management) to move tomorrow.




     On CodeIs to Islamabad, Rich noted the request from post for help in controlling the numbers and said he has
some ideas. Among other things, he told post that they should combine meetings for CodeIs McCain and McConnell
which are arriving in Islamabad the same day.
