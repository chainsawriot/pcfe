Subject: Libya militias demand voice in forming new government (AP)



TRIPOLI, Libya - (AP) Militiamen who fought the regime of ousted leader Moammar Gadhafi have marched
through the Libyan capital demanding a voice in the formation of a new interim government.
   Friday's march is a show of strength by the multiple armed groups from the anti-Gadhafi uprising which the
current leadership has had difficulty reining in.
   The ruling National Transitional Council is to announce a new government next week to carry the country to
elections.
   Commanders from 30 militias from around the country met ahead of the march, planning a coalition to press
their stance with the NTC.
   Abdullah Naker, a Tripoli militia commander at Friday's march, says that if the militias do not approve of the
new Cabinet list, they will not sign on to it.
