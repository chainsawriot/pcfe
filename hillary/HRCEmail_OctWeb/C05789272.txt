H: Pat Lang writes me about the VMI award. Perhaps there might be a time next fall to accept this, a good place for a
speech. Sid

Subject: Clinton award from VMI

Sidney

As we discussed on the phone, the VMI Distinguished-Diplomat Award for Secretary Clinton has gone "agley" in the
matter of a mutually doable date for presentation in Lexington. Some 50 dates have been proposed. None were
workable because of problems with her schedule. As I mentioned to you, the yearly cycle has resulted in the selection of
General Jones, for this year, but this in no way supertedes her selection. They await the time when they can honor
her. If they have to wait until she leaves office, they will gladly do that.

At the same time, the Marshall Foundation which is located at VMI but is not a part of VMI, Is giving her an award on the
2nd of June at the Building Museum in Washington. Splendid idea, but this has nothing to do with VMI. These are two
different institutions.


The difference in these two awards would be worth explaining.

Best

Pat Lang
