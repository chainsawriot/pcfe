Subject: Sudan to slap fees on oil flows from South Sudan (Reuters)


KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudan will impose monthly fees on crude oil flowing from the newly-independent
south until the two nations reach an agreement on transport payments, Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir said on
Wednesday, in a hardening of Sudan's position.

   Bashir, addressing a delegation from the Sudanese parliament, said landlocked South Sudan was benefiting
for now from an absence of mandatory transport fees but that its stance in talks showed it was not serious about
reaching an agreement.

    "Because of this we had taken a unilateral decision to impose passage fees on the crude oil every month, and
this is our right," Bashir said.

   South Sudan will have to pay Khartoum to use its oil pipeline and Red Sea port to ship the oil, but the two
sides have been unable to hammer out details at talks in Ethiopia. The negotiations are due to resume in mid-
January.
