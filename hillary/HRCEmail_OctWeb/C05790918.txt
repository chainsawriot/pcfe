Subject: Updatel: Saudi official denies walkout (Reuters)

DUBAI, Feb 24 (Reuters) -,Saudi Arabia's delegation walked out of a "Friends of Syria" meeting in Tunis over
what it saw as the gathering's "inactivity", Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television said, but a Saudi official said it
had only left to attend bilateral talks.

  Asked about the report, an aide to the Saudi foreign minister told Reuters: "We left to attend bilateral
meetings" on the sidelines of the "Friends of Syria" conference.
