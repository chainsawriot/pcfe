I talked to Yunus. She is making any progess very difficult. The health project he discussed with yoiu can't get OKs from
govt for Nursing school, univ health center, corporate partnerships, etc. If she hears it's Grameen, she stands in way of
licenses, etc, even tho it benefits the country.
He was hoping there might be some way to assure her that he has NO intention of getting into politics in any way and
that she can use him effectively to make the country a model in ways that Grameen can do that. There is some deep
personal antagonism that he can't fathom. Very sad development.

Dear Melanne:




I am drawing your attenrtion to the following report in the leading daily

newspaper in Bangladesh. All other papers carried the same news.

This is a report on the Prime Minister Hasina's speech on the floor

of the parliament. High-lighted section of the report refers to me

without naming name but giving her usual description of me.

See if you can find a way to clear her mind of all the terrifying thoughts

she has about me. I invite you to be a peace-maker! Otherwise it will become

explosive for nothing. PM Hasina is coming to NY for General Assembly

meeting, and will have a meeting with Sec H during her visit.




See you soon.




Yunus

        Prime Mnister Hasina Warns

        The Daily Star, Dhaka, September 17, 2009

        Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday alerted the countrymen to the
        ongoing conspiracy of 'special quarter' and 'undemocratic forces' who are
        still plotting to wipe out democracy and grab the seat in power after
        being failed to capture it.
        The prime minister, however, urged the Leader of the Opposition and BNP
        Chairperson Khaleda Zia and her allies to return to parliament for raising
        their voices.
        Recalling her experience as the opposition leader, Hasina said, "We used
        to walk out from parliament sessions, boycott it but we used to return to
        the House again."




Meanwhile, the parliament session was adjourned till 4:00pm on October 4.
Sheikh Hasina, also ruling Awami League (AL) president, urged people to keep vigil against recurrence of incidents like
BDR mutiny to reverse the democratic strides. She also urged the people not to be misguided by any 'false campaign.'




"While running the government and doing development works, we find continued obstacles in every step from the
'special quarter', benefited by undemocratic government, who earlier had captured power through undemocratic
means, So, I urge the countrymen to be cautious so that the democratic trend continues," she told the parliament.
The prime minister was speaking at a discussion titled 'democracy and political tolerance' on the occasion of the
International Day of Democracy.




Following an hour long discussion, the House passed a resolution by which Bangladesh will also observe the
International Day of Democracy through holding a discussion in the parliament every year.
Inter-Parliamentary Union decided to observe September 15 of every year as International Day of Democracy in the
context of a resolution adopted by the United Nations in 2007.

The International Day of Democracy was first observed in 2008 but Bangladesh could not observe the day as unelected
caretaker government ruled the country during that time.
Referring to the sugar price, Sheikh Hasina told the House that a big conspiracy is going on regarding sugar price. Price of
sugar is being raised though stock of sugar is available. "We are investigating the matter and action will be taken against
those who are responsible for it,"
said the Leader of the House.




On plotting of the conspiracy, Sheikh Hasina said people who wanted to sit in power without election are still hatching
conspiracy against her government.




Pointing out the two years of the past caretaker government, Hasina said, "Various formulas were floated during that
time by those who would lose security money if contest any election."




She also disclosed in parliament that many proposals were given to her
(Hasina) during that time including offering her the status of a prime minister without participating in elections, which
she rejected.




Without mentioning any name, the prime minister said, those who wanted to capture power by creating new political
parties are still continuing their activities to capture power.

        "Those persons who had failed to float a new political party, exploit
        people, get huge interest from poor people and remain in disguise of good
        men wearing good dresses are still busy hatching a conspiracy against the
        government," said Hasina, who was sent to a makeshift jail during the
        anti-graft drive of the past caretaker government.

She, however, hailed the caretaker regime for holding a free and fair election, which she claimed as the best election
since 1973.
The AL Chief Hasina told lawmakers that the country has been pushed back economically, socially and culturally by
applying the undemocratic and military rule while only a special quarter became rich but the majority people remained
ignored.




The premier vowed that her government is committed to materialise all its election pledges to fulfil the desire of the
people.
Hasina said her party believes in the definition of democracy given by Abraham Lincoln who said Democracy means--by
the People, of the People, for the People.




"But this democracy has been absent in the country since 1975 when the military ruler grabbed power throwing an
elected government," she said.
AL leaders Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, Suranjit Sengupta, Abdul Latif Siddiqui, Advocate Fazle Rabbi Mia, Abdul Matin
Khasru, Bangladesh Workers' Party President Rashed Khan Menon, among others, took part in the discussion.
