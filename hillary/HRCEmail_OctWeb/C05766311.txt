Hillary,




On another update, we're trying to address the Hyman Ornish proposal through an upcoming CMS rule that affects many
kinds of procedures, though we're wrangling about whether it can address their entire program. Their program was scored
as a major cost by CB0 (and our actuaries) so they chose to forgo the full-blown legislative route. Nevertheless, Senate
Finance committed $100 million to lifestyle-based interventions. So there's some progress, and I'm hopeful through rules
changes, we can accomplish much, if not all, of what they want to do.

Hope you're getting some rest. You were great on Face the Nation.

Neera
