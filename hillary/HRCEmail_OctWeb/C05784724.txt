Subject: FW: AmCit Child Kidnapped in Manila (SBU)

A 4-year-old U.S. citizen was taken from his mother after her car was stopped at gunpoint outside their gated
community. The abductor demanded a ransom and threatened to kill the victim if authorities were
notified. Embassy Manila is in touch with the victim's family and is coordinating with law enforcement. There
are no custodial issues, so this is not a parental abduction case.
