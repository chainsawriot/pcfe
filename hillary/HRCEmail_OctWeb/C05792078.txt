He was CEO of Edison International, the parent of So Cal Edison, for 18 years. He could be hugely helpful in working out
how to implement Connect 2022, the western hemisphere power initiative S launched in Cartagena. He could help
tremendously in our outreach to the private sector. Do you think S would be amenable to inviting him for a meeting? Or
could she get us in to see him? Appreciate your help. Carlos
