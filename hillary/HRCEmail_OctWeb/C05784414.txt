Background: Senator Brown was an original co-sponsor of S.1619, the Currency Exchange
Rate Oversight Reform Act of 2011, along with Senators Schumer, Graham, and Snowe. The
bill passed the Senate, by a vote of 63-35, on October 11, but it is unlikely to move in the House
any time soon. After the passage of S.1619, Senator Brown said: "We are in a trade war. But
today we're fighting back with one of the biggest bipartisan jobs bills the Senate has seen this
year. Today, we put American workers and American manufacturers first by standing up to the
Chinese."
