Arturo--

 I spoke w                     as I know you did as well. I'd like to discuss ideas about what we can do to help and
summon more support in their reaction to Chavez.
Pls think thru possible public and private strategies that we can discuss Monday.




 And, finally, what's the latest from Honduras?

 It's never dull in WHA! Thanks, Hillary
