Subject: White House, Republicans Said to Reach Tentative Deal on U.S. Debt Ceiling (Bloomberg)




Washington, DC (Bloomberg) - The White House and,congressional Republicans have found the framework of
an agreement to increase the nation's debt ceiling that would raise borrowing authority through the next
presidential election, a person familiar with the talks said late last night.

The tentative outlines of the accord include spending cuts of $1 trillion and creation of a special committee to
recommend additional savings of up to $1.8 trillion. The new panel would have to act before the Thanksgiving
congressional recess in late November or government programs including Defense and Medicare would face
automatic, across-the-board cuts, the person said.

A White House official familiar with the talks cautioned after reports of the framework surfaced last night that
no final agreement has been reached among involved in negotiations.

The prospective agreement wouldn't include increased net revenue, a sticking point for Republicans who've
been adamant that any deal with tax increases couldn't pass the Republican- run House.

Democrats, including those who run the Senate, have been insistent that any deal must be a "balanced
approach" that includes revenue, raising questions about whether President Barark Obama would find the
support of his party for the plan.

Obama Demand
Obama has been demanding an increase in the $14.3 trillion debt limit that lasts through the 2012 election,
when he is seeking another term.

Obama and congressional leaders yesterday began their new attempt to prevent a U.S. government default on its
debt, with Republicans and Democrats expressing greater optimism a deal may be within reach before an Aug.
2 deadline.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, last night said he was "confident that reasonable people from both parties
should be able to reach an agreement."

Reid, in remarks on the Senate floor before details of the framework emerged, cautioned that "there are many
elements to be finalized and there is still a distance to go before any arrangement can be completed." Still he
said, "I am glad to see this move toward cooperation and compromise."

To give the negotiations more breathing room, Reid pushed forward by 12 hours a planned test vote today on
his pending measure to raise the $14.3 debt ceiling and cut government spending. The planned 1 a.m. vote was
rescheduled for 1 p.m. at the Capitol.


Earlier Mitch McConnell, the Senate Minority leader, said he was "more optimistic" and that negotiators have
"got a chance of getting there." John Boehner, the House Speaker of Ohio, also voiced confidence an agreement
could be reached.
