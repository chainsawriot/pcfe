Subject: Egypt sends Christian student to jail for insulting Islam (Reuters)

CAIRO (Reuters) - An Egyptian court April 4 sentenced a 17-year-old Christian boy to three years in jail for
publishing cartoons on his Facebook page that mocked Islam and the Prophet Mohammad, actions that sparked
sectarian violence.

    Gamal Abdou Massoud was also accused of distributing some of his cartoons to his school friends in a
village in the southern city of Assiut, home to a large Christian population and the hometown of the late Coptic
Orthodox Pope Shenouda.

   "Assiut child's court ordered the jailing of Gamal Abdou Massoud ... for three years after he insulted Islam
and published and distributed pictures that insulted Islam and its Prophet," the court said in a statement seen by
Reuters.

  The cartoons, published by Massoud in December, prompted some Muslims to attack Christians. Several
Christian houses were burned and several Christians were injured in the violence.

   Human rights lawyer Negad al-Borai said the jail sentence was the maximum penalty under Egyptian law for
such a crime.
