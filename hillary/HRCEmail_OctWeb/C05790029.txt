Hillary,

My friend, Pat Lang, a member of the board of trustees of VMI, was the one who initiated your speech there.
Unfortunately, he could not attend                                                                                   He
was very sorry he could not be there                                I wonder if you might write Pat a brief note thanking
him for the VMI invitation, how it went,

Here's his home address:




Thanks.

Sid
