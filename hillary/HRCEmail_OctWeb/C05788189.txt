 I have been working with Liz Bagley and the Foreign Affairs Museum Council on their project.
 Liz has done a sensational job raising funds and we are in need of one more major effort to
 secure the first stage funding. That depends heavily now on getting a suitable reception/meeting
 built around Secretary Clinton. I can only imagine the requests for her time and the pressing
 travel and other commitments. The world gets no easier. I would be most grateful if there is
 anything you can do with her to try to nail this down around the time frame suggested by Liz
 which I think is over the next couple of months.



 Please use my interest in this if it matters to Secretary Clinton or anyone else and know that I am
 as always very grateful for your help.



 Also please thank the Secretary for her very helpful and informative letter on involving women
 more effectively in the search for Arab-Israeli peace. I am most grateful to hear about all that she
 and Milan and the rest of your are doing.



 Sincerely,



 Tom Pickering
