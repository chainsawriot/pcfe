Subject: Syria says will prosecute embassy attackers (Reuters)


BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian authorities have said they will prosecute anyone who attacks foreign embassies in
Syria, state media said November 17, after a series of attacks on foreign missions in retaliation for the Arab
League's suspension of Damascus.

   An Interior Ministry statement quoted by the SANA news agency said authorities would meet their
international commitments to protect diplomatic property.

   "The ministry warns anyone who tries to violate the sanctity of diplomatic buildings, or tries to enter or
cause any damage to these missions, that (authorities) will take appropriate legal measures against perpetrators
including arrest and trial," it said.
