Subject: Pakistani president travels to Dubai for tests (AP)

ISLAMABAD - (AP)                    Pakistan's state media says President Asif Ali Zardari has traveled to Dubai to undergo
medical tests.
   The state-run Associated Press of Pakistan quoted the president's personal physician Tuesday as saying the
tests are routine and "linked to a previously diagnosed cardiovascular condition."
   The trip comes as Zardari falls under pressure over a scandal that has forced the Pakistani ambassador to the
U.S. to resign.
   The scandal centers on a memo sent to a top American official in May asking for help in reining in Pakistan's
military, following the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.
   U.S. businessman of Pakistani origin Mansoor Ijaza has accused Pakistan's ex-ambassador to the U.S. Husain
Haqqani of crafting the memo with Zardari's support _ allegations both Haqqani and the president have denied.
