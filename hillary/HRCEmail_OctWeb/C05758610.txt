Let's hope we get the mandate since we know nothing will work w/out it. So how's it going? If I were to talk to one or
two decision makers about a few matters, who would that be--Orszag? Rahm or Zeke? Nancy Ann? Or???

Hope you're enjoying some time off today. Pls stay in touch.

This was on Paul Krugman's blog yesterday. I, for one, enjoyed it. Hope you're very well Hillary.

       Health care could soon go the way of the automobile, with users having no choice but to buy insurance
coverage.

        Within four years, every American could be required to own health insurance or pay their way through tax
penalties. The odds of such a sea change rose last week when chief Democratic and Republican Senate negotiators on a
health care bill acknowledged that many on the Finance Committee considered the so-called individual mandate
essential to lower insurance costs for those who already have coverage.




        President Barack Obama didn't embrace the individual mandate during the campaign, which means he would
essentially start from scratch in terms of selling the idea to voters.

        The mandate was a central policy difference with Hillary Clinton, who argued that a mandate was the only way
to achieve universal coverage. Obama disagreed, saying enough people would purchase insurance voluntarily if the costs
could be brought down.

        Progressive policy experts widely agreed that Obama's plan would have left out about 15 million people. Clinton,
with an assist from New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, regularly assailed Obama for his no-mandate position.

Actually, I don't care who gets credit, as long as we actually get universal health care.
