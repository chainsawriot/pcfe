We see it in the car but the doors are locked and were waiting for the Chinese to bring the key. Agents and caroline and I
are waiting for the keys to come. Will email you as soon as he has his berry.

I left the book for tomorrow right outside your bedroom door.

Departure tomorrow is at 8:40am.

Appointment at 7:15am and pre-brief at 8:15am (assuming that you want one) work for you?
