Subject: Jim Wallis Interview Request...

Don't know where to send this... I'll share with you... I think its worthy of your consideration... It would need to happen,
by phone, within the next 7 days as I understand it...




Sojourners, as you know, has a great magazine.., has been one of that orgs stalwarts since the beginning and during the
most recent magazine awards programs it was the only faith-based magazine to receive top honors across the board,
receiving the "best of" several categories.., it's a good product... they have a nationwide subscribership of about
350,000... plus it has an online presence...




Several times a year Jim will conduct an interview with someone he feels is making a significant impact on the nation
and world... He has been deeply impacted by your personal focus on women and the impoverished and would like to
interview you for feature in one of the Sojourner upcoming additions... it would be all about your work and focus on
women and the impoverished.., a totally positive, enlightening and feel good piece... He recently interviewed Bono for
this feature slot...




I hope you are interested... I think it would be very smart considering attitudes out there in the progressive faith
community these days... Your witness on your work, with such a strong endorsement by Jim would be positive across the
board...




Let me know how to proceed if this is possible...
