CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian presidential candidate Mohamed ElBaradei is prepared to drop his bid to be head
of state if he is asked to lead a new government, his campaign team said in a statement on Saturday.

   "If it is officially requested of him to form a national salvation government, he would give up making a bid
for the presidency, so as to be completely neutral in the interim period," the statement read.
