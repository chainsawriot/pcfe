Re: No fly zone over Libya


UK former Foreign Secretary David Owen has called for a no-fly zone over Libya, imposed by the United
Nations and/or Nato, like the no-fly zone imposed on Saddam' s Iraq. US might consider advancing tomorrow.
Libyan helicopters and planes are raining terror on cities.

Article below:


UN should authorise NATO and Egypt to enforce
Libyan 'No Fly Zone' to protect civilians
In the wake of reported air attacks on civilian crowds by the Libyan airforce, former Foreign Secretary Lord
David Owen has called on the UN Security Council to immediately meet in emergency session and authorise a
`No Fly Zone' over Libya.
Speaking on al Jazeera, Lord Owen called for a UN Charter Chapter 7 intervention (meaning the authorisation
of both military and non-military means to "restore international peace and security") to be enforced by NATO
air forces with Egyptian military support to demonstrate regional backing for the effort.

.,ord Owen said: "The UN Security Council should meet in emergency session tonight and declare the situation
n Libya as a threat to peace under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter and declare a no flight zone for the Libyan air
brce and ask the regional power, Nato, to enforce it from dawn tomorrow. And hopefully other Arab nations,
)articularly Egypt, might decide to participate to demonstrate that this is not just a Western initiative."
.,ord Owen went on to call for "air forces in the region with sufficient range to reach Libya to prevent any
.ibyan air force military action against civilians". The call matches those of human rights advocates for actions
rot just words from the international community. The New York Times' Nick Kristof tweeted : "Under "Right
o Protect" doctrine, West cld bomb air fields from which Qaddafi's warplanes are taking off." And: "Better
'et: Egypt & Tunisia could use their air forces to ground Qadaffi's planes, keep him from slaughtering his
)eople."
