Subject: Death of NYT Reporter in Syria

Ops just called to report (via PA) that NYT reporter Anthony Shadid died today in Syria (exact location in Syria unknown
at this time). Cause of death is believed at this time to be an asthma attack. Unknown if there was fighting in the area
where he died or external contributing factors to the death. He was traveling with an AMCIT photographer, Tyler
Bridges, who is with the body now in Turkey, heading to Adana. NEA is advising the Poles, and CA is reaching out to our
embassy in Ankara and Consulate in Istanbul.
