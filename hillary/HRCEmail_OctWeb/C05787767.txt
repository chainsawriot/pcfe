Subject: Lithuanian man blows up himself near U.S. Embassy (Reuters)

DS Command reports this incident was an apparent suicide and that Embassy Vilnius was not the target of the
explosion.

VILNIUS (Reuters) - A Lithuanian man blew up himself near the U.S. Embassy in the Baltic state's capital
overnight but the embassy was not thought to have been targeted, police said on Friday.

  "No, the initial suspicion is that this was a suicide," a police spokesman said by telephone, when asked if the
man had been trying to damage the embassy.

  An officer on duty at the embassy said it had not been damaged by the explosion, which took place a few
hundred metres away and was heard throughout the city centre.

    "It was a horrible thing to happen, but the embassy was not the target," an embassy spokesman said later.

  Delfi news portal said the police had identified the man killed as a 19-year-old from Lithuanian city of
Kaunas based on documents found nearby.

   Lithuania, an ex-Soviet state, which joined the European Union in 2004, has one of the highest suicide rates
in Europe.
