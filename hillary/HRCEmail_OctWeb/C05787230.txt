As I thought... this was a Post driven initiative. Not an ECA sports exchange. Attached below in case
you want to see... the Post explanation of her selection. (highlighted important part).

Hello Nicole,
Not ignoring you, just running with our program. I promise you an answer later this week when Marion moves on to
Croatia. In brief, I read an article about her, contacted her agent and we put a program together over the next few
months. She has been fantastic and I cannot recommend her highly enough. We do not use ECA for Speakers,
something that predates me. We used AEECA speaker funds to get her but post administers the program 100%. Hope
this provides you a start.

Ryan

Nicole —

Great to hear from you. To be honest, I would ask Ryan Rowlands and Anne Marie Moore (PAO and CAO
Belgrade), since I heard about the visit from them. Marion may have been one of those visitors he knew about
through other contacts (as in, not through Sports United), and when they offered it to us, we said yes
immediately. Belgrade friends — can you provide Nicole the background on Marion's visit?

We would still love to have more sports exchanges, especially since it remains one of the tools that works so
well here. It would not be duplicating efforts; this visit by Marion is focused on the Rule-of-law message (don't
dope, respect institutions), but I know other Sports Programs could really resonate with the Reconciliation
message — and that's what we would like the most. So please do keep Zagreb in mind, and we are developing
our strategy for Sports diplomacy. We will be in touch in 2 weeks with those ideas.

Finally, the cities listed below are in Serbia, though we are taking Marion to sites around Zagreb, Dubrava, and
Zadar during her stay here.

Thanks, Sita

Hey Sita,
 Hope you're still enjoying Zagreb...from your pictures of the Jesse White Tumblers and Chicago Week it looks like you guys are
doing some really fun and impressive work Makes me sorry to miss it.

I was wondering if you could help me out with a question...do you know many of the details about the below visitor to SR and
HR? Specifically through what program she is visiting? I'm working in ECA now in the Citizen Exchange office and one of our
divisions SportsUnited basically does sports exchanges/visitors/envoys like these but they hadn't heard about this visit. If you have
any info on how the visit came to be that would be really helpful. SportsUnited was looking at doing a sports visit for the Balkans so
wouldn't want to duplicate efforts or throw money where it isn't needed. As an aside...I don't recognize any of those towns she's
visiting...are those in Croatia? .

MARION JONES BRINGS "TAKE A BREAK MESSAGE" TO SERBIA AND CROATIA

 • U.S. Embassies Invite Former WNBA Player & World Track & Field Champion to Share Life Lessons with Serbian and Croatian
Youth

World class athlete Marion Jones, has been invited by the U.S. Embassies in Serbia and Croatia to share her life lessons and "Take a
Break" message of hope and encouragement with youth. Ms. Jones, a former WNBA basketball player for the Tulsa Shock and a
celebrated world track and field champion will present a series of lectures, and        clinics during her visit to universities, high
school and elementary school students in Serbia & Croatia from October 17 - 22.

The visit to Serbia and Croatia is part of the U.S. Embassy's global effort to engage and educate youth and a future generation of
leaders by using a shared love of sports as a platform to impart important life lessons.
During her visit, Marion Jones will deliver lectures at the University of Scrub, and will travel to His, and Belgrade to conduct
basketball workshops and speak to Serbian youth, coaches and the public about the importance of making good decisions and moving
beyond past mistakes.

The lectures are based on the "Take a Break" initiative, a nongovernmental program created by Ms. Jones to encourage youth to stop,
step away, think
and seek good advice when faced with a difficult decision. Through the
popular Take a Break program, she uses her experiences and life skills to coach others to live a better life and avoid costly mistakes.

 Take A Break , was developed from lessons learned by Ms. Jones in her own life, and chronicled in "On the Right Track" a recent
autobiography of the national championship college basketball player and internationally recognized female track and field star, who
became the first woman ever to win five medals at the Sydney Olympic games. She was later stripped of the medals due to her
admission to using performance enhancing drugs, and convicted to six months in federal prison for lying to federal
investigators. Today, through "Take a Break", Marion Jones works with
students throughout the U.S., teaching them how to handle tough situations and how to make informed and rationaldecisions as a way
to live a better life.
