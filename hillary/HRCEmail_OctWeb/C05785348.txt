Subject: P-Ashton telcon

P spoke with EU Ashton, strongly urging that the EU move beyond the sanctioning of Libyan individuals, in
order to capture Libyan state assets, including the sovereign wealth fund. Ashton responded that this weekend
she will come out ahead of the 27 and call for broader sanctions; in particular, on the sovereign wealth
fund. She said it would help for the Secretary to call FM Frattini, given Italy's pronounced reservations.
