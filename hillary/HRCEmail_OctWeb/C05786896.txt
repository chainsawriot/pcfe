Jake,

Hope things are rolling along smoothly on the road.

This is the draft comment that L drafted in the Secretary's name to give to Paul Starobin, the reporter profiling Harold
for the NYT magazine. It wouldn't be deployed until after Harold sits with the reporter on Monday.

Philippe and Mike are good with it; wanted to see if you would clear with the Secretary.

Thanks.




"I have known Harold Koh for a long time in the many different roles we have both played over the years. I have known
Harold as a law professor, as Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, as Dean of Yale Law
School, and now as State Department Legal Adviser.

As Legal Adviser, Harold plays a critical role in advising me and the Department on the multitude of complex legal issues
we confront every day. He leads what I like to call 'the greatest international law firm in the world,' and he does so with
candor, energy, and incredible intellect. In these times of grave challenges and great opportunities for the United
States, I have come to rely on Harold's clear-eyed and unvarnished legal advice more than ever. He is an essential part of
my team and a valued asset to our country."
