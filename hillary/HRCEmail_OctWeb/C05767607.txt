•   Just curious whether you received the emails I sent to you over the past 2 months, re; pakistan, doug holloway, etc.
    Nothing urgent they were informational only but I am concerned our emails may be hitting some tech glitch.

    Judith--

     Happy New Year to you and your family and thank you for making this journey w me. I'm looking forward to the work
    ahead in 2010.

     A few odds and ends—

      Have you heard of the Ben Franklin awards for public diplomacy? I saw a reference to them and don't know what they
    are.

     Have you connected w Georgetown Prof and former Amb Cynthia Schneider? She has written and worked on cultural
    engagement in the Muslim world and wants to help.

                                                                                                                      f so,   B5
    when would you be ready to dolt?

     All the best--H
