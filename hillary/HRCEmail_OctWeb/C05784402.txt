Subject:                          Iraq



We attempted to raise the issue of women's participation in the Iraq government, in their economy and more broadly
when Biden was just in Baghdad. Jeff Feltman was trying to get it into the conversations there.

You will recall the comments of the Iraqi who participated in the NGO meeting with you in Doha about how the door
has been closed to women in the government. We have had many discussions with impressive Iraqi women over the last
couple years, and to a person they describe their fate as worse now than years ago. Yet without them it will be even
harder for Iraq to move forward. To that end, we have been working with post on a action plan along the lines of the
National Action Plan on women, peace and security, you will launch next week.

I hope you will find a way to raise the "women's issue" in your discussions tom'w.
