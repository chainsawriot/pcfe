Subject: Libyan fighters capture Gadhafi hometown of Sirte

SIRTE (AP) - Libyan fighters have overrun the last positions of Moammar Gadhafi loyalists holding out in the
city of Sirte and the revolutionaries now have all of the ousted leader's hometown within their hands.
   Reporters on the scene say the final push to capture the remaining pro-Gadhafi positions began around 8 a.m.
on Thursday and was over after about 90 minutes. Just before the assault, about five carloads of loyalists tried to
flee the enclave down the coastal highway but were killed by revolutionaries.
   Revolutionaries began searching homes and buildings looking for any Gadhafi fighters who may be hiding
there.
