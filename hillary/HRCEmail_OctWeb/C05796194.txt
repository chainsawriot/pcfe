Subject: China says Bo Xilai's wife suspected of murder - Xinhua (Reuters)

BEIJING (Reuters) - The wife of the former high-flying Communist Party chief of China's Chongqing city is
suspected in the murder of British national Neil Heywood, Chinese state media reported April 10.

    Former party chief in the city, Bo Xilai, has been suspended from top party bodies, state media said.

   Evidence gathered during a police investigation indicated that Heywood's death was homicide and that Bo's
wife, Gu Kalai, and an orderly at the Bo's home are "highly suspected," reported Xinhua.

  A separate item on Xinhua said that Bo has been suspended from membership China's elite Central
Committee and Politburo. Bo is suspected of "serious discipline violations," said Xinhua.
