Had Q Envoys call. We agreed to keep at it and that Q statement best outcome. But differences remain. However
Palestinians have given themselves until the Arab follow up meeting in middle September to decide what to do
definitively. So we have a little more time. David conveyed a tough USA message which was good.
I also had a call from Gaddafi's right hand guy. He asked for a way forward. Said he was asking on behalf of G. I said G
had to appoint someone to do negotiation and if he did I would convey this to our side and see if a negotiation were
possible. He came back to me to say G had designated him. So I'm conveying. Personally I think you guys should
designate someone on your side and get this moving. G's person is sensible and really does have his ear. I'm sure this is
G who is authorising this.
