  Madeleine--

  I hope you heard about the great mtg I had w the Turkish PNB chapter. They were enthusiastic and excited about their
  potential. I mentioned them in my press appearances and to Turkish leaders.

  And in Indonesia I was able to say that they would have a PNB chapter too.

  So, the word is spreading!
  Thank you for your leadership and friendship which mean the world to me! Happy Summer--H

  Dear Hillary
  Another important trip. I know you have a ton on your mind and a big agenda in Turkey. Nevertheless, if you have a
  chance to mention PNB in your meetings or to the press it would be a great boost. You may remember at the dinner you
  hosted, the Turkish local chapter was really on its way. The head of it is Rifat Hisarciklioglu,President of TOBB (business
  trade assocY

  Here's to you good buddy
  Madeleine
