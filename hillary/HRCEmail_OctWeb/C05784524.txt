Subject: RE: Turkey- accepting assistance

According to this update from the desk, the Iranian and Azerbaijani aid was unsolicited. We'll stay engaged on this.

Just a quick update. We expect post to weigh in with a front channel cable shortly but from what they told us this
morning by phone the aid provided by Iran and Azerbaijan to Turkey was unsolicited. The two planes from Azerbaijan
were in the air, requesting permission to land before the GOT was aware of the offer of support. With respect to Iran,
the border is roughly 100 miles from the hardest hit area and we suspect Iranian representatives brought assistance
across the border, again unsolicited. Press reports indicate this aid was distributed in an uncoordinated manner,
resulting in a rather chaotic scene which Turkish police had to manage. Please let me know if you have any
questions. We will share more as we have it. Thank you.

Phil,
Per our conversation this morning, I called US Sinirlogliu and discussed




                                                                                and I told him that we stood ready to
 be of assistance. Would suggest you deliver same message to Tan and see his response. Thanks.
Wendy
