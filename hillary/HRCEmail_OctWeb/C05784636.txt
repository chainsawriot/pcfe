Subject: Arabs give Syria until end of day on deal -source (Reuters)



CAIRO (Reuters) - A deadline set by the Arab League for Syria to sign a deal allowing monitors into the
country expired on Friday without any Syrian response but Arab governments will give Damascus until the end .
of the day to answer, an Arab source said.

   Arab foreign ministers had said in Cairo on Thursday that unless Syria agreed to let the monitors in to assess
progress of an Arab League plan to end eight months of internal bloodshed, officials would consider imposing
sanctions on Saturday.

    "The deadline has already ended, but the Arab League leaves the door open for Syria to reply by the end of
the day and if a positive Syrian response comes on Friday, then the Arab League has no objection to agreeing to
it," the source said.
