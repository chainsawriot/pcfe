I'm glad it was a useful idea. I'm off to Lebanon next week with Sec Albright and former Canadian PM Joe Clark for a pre-
election observer mission. Look forward to seeing you soon thereafter. Best, Doug

You said to keep the ideas coming, so here you go




This might be useful for your upcoming trip to Africa.




The idea came in a conversation with the director of Central and West Africa for NDI. He is a Harvard-trained PhD from
Cameroon. He has worked across the continent and is well connected in NGO and political circles.




He remembered attending a roundtable event that you and President Clinton held in Dakar, with NGO representatives
from across the continent. He said that was a very successful event from an African point of view. People still
remember it as a substantive discussion and a symbolically important gesture.

Our idea is to hold a conference of MCC Compact countries. As you know, these countries are qualified to obtain US
assistance through the Millenium Challenge Corp. MCC requires that countries meet democratization as well as
economic development criteria.




At the event, you would lead a discussion about how the MCC is working for the people of those countries, and how to
make it better.




In keeping with Judith McHale's vision of public diplomacy, this approach would create connections between people
working on these issues that will be useful to them beyond the event.




Showcasing MCC Compact countries shows our commitment to democracy and development. This will send a strong
signal in a positive way. It recognizes progress being made and raises the bar for all, without pointing fingers at those
that fall short.




You could invite prime ministers from Compact countries, economic ministers from threshold countries which are close
to meeting MCC criteria, and NGO observers from countries that have democracy issues to address.




MCC is well received in Africa and development circles. It is something that the Bush Administration did right. Building
on it will show continuity in development policy, which is helpful to people working on the ground. And it shows we're
not throwing out the baby with the bath water.




It makes real the connection between democracy and development. It's important for people to see how democracy
leads to tangible benefits in their lives.




This is a substantive way to deliver a positive message to Africans about America's commitment to development and
democracy.




Hope that's a useful idea. Looking forward to getting together when Lona can find a date.




Best, Doug
