Subject: Russia slams United States for its human rights record (AP)


MOSCOW - (AP) Russia's Foreign Ministry has attacked the U.S. human rights record in a report on
injustice and violations around the globe.
   In the paper published on Wednesday, Moscow criticized President Barack Obama for "legalizing indefinite
and extrajudicial custody and the return of court-martials."
   In its first-ever report on breaches of human rights abroad, Russia focused on EU nations, Canada and
Georgia, but the longest section of the report highlights violations in the U.S.
   Moscow laments the ongoing operation of the "notorious" prison in Guantanomo Bay, prying into citizens'
personal lives and judicial errors.
