Subject: Pakistan to boycott meeting over deadly NATO raid (AP)

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan - (AP) Pakistani officials say the country will boycott an upcoming meeting in
Germany on the future of Afghanistan to protest a deadly attack by U.S.-led forces on its troops.
  The officials say the decision was taken during a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday in the city of Lahore.
   They spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to talk to the media ahead of an
official announcement.
  The decision reflects Pakistan's anger over the incident on Saturday that killed 24 soldiers along the border
between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
