We have not heard back from Lavrov about his availability for friday. We have reached out and I'll let you know as soon
as we hear back.
Al-faisal is on safari in africa- the ball is in his court.
Sakaashvili - we haven't reached out for times yet- would you like me to see if he's available friday morning?
