BUENOS AIRES, Argentina - (AP) Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez has been re-elected by a
landslide.
   Exit polls say Fernandez has gotten 54 percent to 55 percent of the votes cast in Sunday's election. That is the
widest victory margin for any Argentine president since democracy was restored in the country three decades
ago.
   One exit poll indicates that her closest of six rivals will have no more than 13 percent of the vote.
