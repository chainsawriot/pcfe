Jalili actually having bilat with Russia right now. Bagheri says doesn't know about US. Will ask. Day has told Cathy Jalili
will want another bilat with her.

Doubt we will have bilat. My guess is Russians finish. Ashton has bilat. She and Sergey debrief all. We go into final
plenary. Then press announcement. Will keep you posted.
