Dear Cheryl:

As we discussed, I have added two sentences to the State-OFAC letter â€”

                       I'm attaching three documents: the revised draft, the grid that you have seen, and the OFAC-
State memo that you have also seen.

The only document that is changed is the one labeled "revised draft from State."

I have not shown the revisions to AID, as I want to be sure they work for you first.

Two other issues about which you should be aware:

First




Best,
Eric
