Sorry to bother you, but I wanted to take just a brief moment to thank you for your support and encouragement while I
was being considered for the LPA Assistant Administrator position at USAID.

Although in the end it didn't work out, I'm very appreciative of everything both you and Cheryl did on my behalf.

Thanks.
