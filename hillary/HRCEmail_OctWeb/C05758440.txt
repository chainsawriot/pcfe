Michele,

 Thanks for the followup w Jackie.

  As to the supp, I have consistently conveyed the admin position to Rep. Lowey, Rep. Obey and others in private and
public, but they don't agree w it and persist in arguing for the $ to come to State. Jack Lew met w them again today, and
told them Sec Gates and I had agreed that State needed both new authorities and capacities which we would work
toward for 2010. Bob and I will testify to that tomorrow in our joint Senate appearance. I don't know whether the
House will agree, but we will keep trying.

 I will copy Jack on this if you want to discuss w him. All the best, Hillary

Secretary Clinton: I look forward to meeting with Jackie and will get her on my schedule soonest.

By the way, I just testified before the HASC on Pakistan and there was much rumbling about moving the Pakistan
Counterinsurgency Capabilities Fund from Titile 10 to Titile 22.
                                                                                                                     It
would be incredibly helpful if you would be willing to convey this position to Rep Lowey before this gets too far down
the road.

Thanks so much! And good luck on the Hill tomorrow.

Michele
