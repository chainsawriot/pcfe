Dear Neera,

  I am so happy for you, for CAP and for the progressive agenda we both care so much about. After John mentioned
your becoming President following my speech (and thanks for your kind comments), I waited from afar (seven countries
in seven days...)for an official announcement. Finally, today it came. And well-deserved it is. CAP couldn't have done
better, and I look forward to watching w pride and telling people, "I knew her when...."

 If I can ever be of help--now or when I become a "former"-- please just ask.

 All the best to you and CAP, H
