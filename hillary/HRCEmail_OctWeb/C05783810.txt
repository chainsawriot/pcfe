Madame Secretary -

Thank you for meeting with Asep Sulaeman, the Chairman of the local PNB Committee in Indonesia and the Sr VP for
Exxon Mobil in Jakarta and Robin McClellan, a newly retired FS0 who was the CG in Perth, Australia and is now
employed by Exxon.

You briefly met Asep during the PNB dinner earlier this year and I spent time with them both in Jakarta last month.
Indonesia promises to be a successful PNB country because like Turkey, a number of US companies are interested in
participating.



Your "hello" and statement that PNB is an important item on your agenda will allow
                                       The funding will help them hire a full time Exec Director to run the project. We
are helping them develop a mechanism to accept the funds and move forward.

                                                                                       She and I have talked about how
to move forward.

Thnx and safe travels.

Kris
