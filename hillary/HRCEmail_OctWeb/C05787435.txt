Thanks, my friend. I will respond directly.

Did Bill tell you that on the receiving line of his second speech yesterday, he had the weirdest exchange ever when a
woman loudly announced that her father "circumcised Bin Laden!" What a claim to fame. Love to all--

    Dear Madam Secretary

                   I am writing you today in great gratitude for the impact you have made in our community and my family
.We have struggled for the past five years living almost day to day and some days it felt by the hour. I am a transsexual
woman in the construction trades, married with children.
As you are aware this nation is struggling as well ,and to make matters worse the construction industry has been hardest
hit. With this in mind , I have applied at well over 300 job openings since 2007. I was able to get about a dozen interviews
and as soon as they found out I was a transgender person all bets were off. In Illinois we are blessed to have a civil rights
bill protecting GLBT people and have the Illinois Department of human rights to enforce these laws. The truth of the
matter is you can not work for some one that does not want you there. For the past year we have been aggressive at
building a new , diverse business to employ people based on skills and goals , not gender nor color , or sexuality . We
achieved a milestone in accomplishment , today we are certified as a FBE ( Female Business Enterprise) as a trans
woman. With all the documentation involved in transition and the many raised eyebrows we face in our quest for
acceptance , The passport change made a major impact. When I went to my state , to begin the process , I stated " My
country accepts me as a woman and this State should do as well" , My passport reads female for Department of State , I

have been checked by homeland security , I am whom I am. Last month we were certified by our State , some federal
and several large corporations as a woman owned business , disadvantaged women's business, and many other well
needed classes.

                This business is built on my lifetime of contracting experience and it is now certified as such. It would have
been very easy to do this in my supportive spouses name , but that would have been living another lie . With this new
pathway of progress forged in our state , it opens the doors for others to follow. We got our first real job last week, we
hired two unemployed people . That job put three people back to work and yes it has trickle down economy out here in
Rockford where we hold the highest unemployment in the state . As we grow we will continue to hire people and make a
positive impact in an economic disaster area. There are many skilled people who hold the same goals , and dreams just
like me . You helped make my dream come true and I am forever grateful for your understanding and compassion
towards not just the transgender community but the entire LGBT community of this nation and world. We are Gods
creations , yes we have been given challenges , but also blessed with many gifts and talents to make up for the hardships
we would face. Thank you for your acceptance and taking action where others before have turned their backs.


Respectfully
