Subject: Somalia question

Jake, in response to your question from earlier this morning:

The TFG (President Sharif and PM Mohamed), Somaliland (President Silanyo, which is huge as Somaliland has never
attended international conferences on Somalia), Puntland (we think President Farole will come; if not, will likely be his
"foreign minister"), and Ahlu Sunna Wal Jamma (ASWJ, a moderate religious group with guns that also runs a couple of
regional governments and is a political partner with the TFG, will send its chairman) will all have representation at the
conference. The region of Galmadug may also send a representative (likely its president) and the mayor of Mogadishu
may also attend, but neither have confirmed yet. The TFG, Puntland, ASWJ, and Galmadug are the Roadmap signatories.
In terms of Somalia conferences, this is broadest representation of Somalis I've seen since the 2008 Djibouti conference.
