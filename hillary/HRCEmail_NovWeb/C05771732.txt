    Re: More on Mid-terms

1. No comment on the inability of the White House to execute political themes, tactics and strategy; or sustain a campaign;
   or develop new ideas; or be behind the curve; etc.
2. Debating points should be sent to all candidates, House and Senate, containing the wackiest positions of various GOP
   candidates of the Tea Party variety. Democrats should demand that their opponents clarify where they stand on each and
   every point, beginning with privatizing Social Security to ending unemployment insurance to rescinding civil rights, etc.
3. The DNC should take all the wacky positions and line them up, number them and present them as the new GOP program.
   Unlike in 1994, the GOP has not offered a unified "Contract With America." So present one. Hold a press conference.
4. Christina O'Donnell has been shown in a video to have been a dabbler in witchcraft. Not good for GOP religious right
   base. Could someone please make the connection between her witchcraft practice and voodoo economics? This week
   should be witchcraft/voodoo economics week.
5. Obama, not just Biden, should.go to Delaware soon, keep the focus on.
6. Of course, the White House has lost the plot on Boehner after he was forced to flip flop on taxes. He was incredibly
   vulnerable, but no one went in for the kill. There's still time on that one. Create an Internet ad from the DCCC and float it
   to MSNBC, the bloggers, etc., go viral. Go back to criticizing him, raising his profile. Force him to take stands on the
   wacky Tea Party positions.
7. Off to CGI.
