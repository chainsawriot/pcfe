Re: Pat Lang's view

Pat's view in summary is this: The Palestinians will not and cannot negotiate toward a resolution that is not
stated as the objective beforehand, that this was a fatal flaw at the 1999 Camp David meetings. He believes this
is not only a political imperative for them but also a psychological one. Obama's initial no-settlements
declaration was a non-starter, thrown into a vacuum. Launching direct talks without clear conditions, Pat thinks,
is doomed to failure. Given that the talks are engaged, he thinks that the U.S. should privately state its detailed
position on final boundaries and Jerusalem at the beginning, making clear that these are the conditions. The
U.S. must be insistent, especially with Israel, playing very firm and tough, or else the talks will collapse, which
is likely the Israeli objective. Abbas has agreed to the talks out of basic weakness, If the talks fail, he will be
drastically discredited and the political prestige of Hamas and Hezbollah greatly increased. That will serve
Israel's purposes, which are to see the talks fail and use their failure as a launching pad for the next stage
against Hamas and Hezbollah.

Pat's not wrong but that doesn't make him right--for example, what's the


alternative?

 "The Middle East peace process resumed in May, after a hiatus of 19 months, but


it stalled again over the terms of moving from indirect talks, mediated by U.S.


envoy George Mitchell, to direct negotiations.


Israel <http://www.washincItql-Tost.comiwp-srv/wor.ldicountries/israel.html?nav=el>


insists it is ready for direct talks, provided there are no preconditions. The

 Palestinians are ready provided there is a clear agenda. Israel says an agenda


 means preconditions.


 Resolving the snag over terms is crucial, diplomats say." Washpost




 The former NY Times reporter Judy Miller likes to address me as "gloomy gus" or


 some such thing when I encounter her. Well, stand by for some more gloom.


 The second Camp David talks failed because Dennis Ross and company placed the


 Palestinian delegation in a position in which a "solution" was demanded and


 expected by the Americans and Israelis on the basis of bargaining during the


 negotiations themselves.


 This seemed reasonable at the time to the US and Israeli negotiators. After


 all, is this not what one does? Should not the outcome be the product of the


 dialectic of argument and persuasion?


 Arabs generally think not.       They tend to believe that negotiations are for the


 purpose of of arranging the details of outcomes that are understood in advance'


 of the conference itself. For them, anything else is an attempt to win


  concessions through trickery.


â€¢"The Palestinians are ready provided there is a clear agenda. Israel says an


  agenda means preconditions."


  Hello! What kind of nonsense is this? Have we learned nothing?


  And then, there is the "little" matter of the non-participation of Hamas. Does

the Obama Administration really think that this 600 pound gorilla can be


ignored? Is this some sort of scheme on the part of Natanyahu, and "the boys"


to discredit Abbas so that an isolated Hamas can be attacked and destroyed


later?


Realism in diplomacy is a desirable thing. George Mitchell used to be smarter


than this. His staff should be advising him not to do this. Failure will be


catastrophic.


All the players should be engaged, and they are not. The outcome should be


known in advance and it is not.


This is both childish and destructive. pl
