Hi Cheryl,

I am sorry to have missed you on the phone this morning. I should have called earlier! I would have much
preferred to speak to you on the phone, but I don't want to lose time on this Monday morning either.

After careful thought and discussion this weekend, I have decided that I can't, in good conscience, renege on my
many obligations and commitments to take on the full time Iraq job right now. I am extremely grateful for our
discussion on Thursday and for your willingness to go to bat for me with the White House. As eager as I am to
serve again, I regret very much that I am not in a position to take this on right now.

I am at                  virtually all day.

Please convey my deep regrets about this to the Secretary as well as my profound thanks for the time she spent
with me last Thursday.

All the best,

Like music to my ears - I already am working on it.

I hope you can catch Jake Sullivan and Jim Jeffery as well and then you might feel ready to discuss what makes sense.

I hope so.

Best
