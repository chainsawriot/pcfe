 Jake, pis pass following note to S

 Dear Madam Secretary,

 I understand that the selection process for the next round of COM nominations is beginning. I want to recommend
 strongly            selection to be the next COM in Seoul.

       is one of the most impressive
 officers with whom I've worked in several decades in and around the Department. He has a focused understanding of US
 interests, unrivaled experience in the US-ROK relationship and a clear vision of its centrality in the rapidly evolving
 context of East Asia. Moreover, he has the character and leadership ability needed to be an oustanding Ambassador.

 If I can provide any additional information or assessment during the selection process please let me know.
