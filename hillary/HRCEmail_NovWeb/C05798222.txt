Subject: Farewell

Dear Cheryl,

I know that you'll be heading out soon and have a million things to do, but I wanted to tell you what a joy and honor it
was working for you and the Secretary's team during my year on S staff — I never properly thanked you enough for
selecting me and for giving me the opportunity.

I also wanted to mention that my wife and I watched all of the Secretary's testimony last week and needless to say, we
were both incredibly impressed by her performance (as were millions of others). But I also was so happy to see you
right there next to her — made me proud all over again that I had served as part of your team.

Please send my best to the Secretary and to all of those departing -- you were all fantastic, friendly, and fun (not to
mention brilliant) and the place won't be the same without you.

Wishing you all the best on your next adventure, Zia.
