The Republicans but not the American people have been obsessed with Libya and trying to pin the acts of terrorists on
you. They have been playing this non stop on their cable tv.

But I don't think the emotion in the hearing works to your advantage -- looks more like they rattled you on something no
one outside the crazy right blamed you for anyway.

I think you either let it lie and say I think I've said everything that needs to be said on this or if asked why so emotional
you might explain that you were just frustrated with the apparent high level of partisanship on this issue -- we should be
pulling together here and not losing our focus on the fight against terrorism which has always been a bipartisan issue
and focusing on the big questions that confront us. (This answer would drive the republicans crazy but I'd rather they
talk about how you accused them of being partisan which everyone knows is true)
