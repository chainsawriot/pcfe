Subject:                            FW: Grand Strategies for the Next Obama Term



Dear all,
I published the following in the Washington Post this morning, reviewing three grand strategies put out by The Atlantic
Council (written by Robert Manning), the Council on Foreign Relations (written by Dan Deudney and John Ikenberry),
and Patrick Doherty at the New America Foundation. http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/does-obama-have-a-
grand-strategv-for-his-second-term-if-not-he-could-try-one-of-these/2013/01/18/ec78cede-5f27-11e2-a389-
ee565c81c565 storv.html

In addition, for anyone who is interested, I wrote up a new approach to grand strategy in a paper I wrote for the Center
for a New American Security last June, calling for a grand strategy of network
centrality. http://www.cnas.orgiamericaspath

Best,
Anne-Marie
