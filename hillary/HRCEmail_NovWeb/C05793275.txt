Subject: Update on Rev. Jackson's Trip to Gambia

Cheryl and Jake:

Reverend Jesse Jackson called me around 6 pm this evening (9/17) to provide a readout of his trip to Gambia to urge
President Jammeh to stop the arbitrary execution of death row inmates. The visit appears to have been a success. Rev.
Jackson said that President Jammeh agreed to an indefinite moratorium on further executions, and also agreed to
release two Gambian-American citizens serving sentences of 20 years from a Gambian jail. According to our Embassy in
Banjul, one of these Americans was convicted of allegedly participating in a coup plot, and the other was allegedly
convicted of treason for printing pro-democracy T-shirts. Our Embassy also reports that President Jammeh agreed to
release the two Americans provided they return directly to the United States with Rev. Jackson tomorrow. Our Embassy
and Ambassador Ned Alford assisted Rev. Jackson and his delegation in Banjul, and are now working with Consular
Affairs to expedite the departure of the released Americans.
We did not sponsor this trip, but our Embassy provided the appropriate facilitative support â€” for which Rev. Jackson
praised. Please pass to the Secretary as appropriate.

Johnnie
