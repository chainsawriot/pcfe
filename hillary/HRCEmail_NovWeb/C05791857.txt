I was coming until I learned that I cannot leave the Cook Islands, whether traveling east or west, and get to Morocco in
time to open the BMENA conference on gender which the US is leading and which I'm obligated to do.
Wenchi on our staff is heading to Cook Is in advance of your arrival to work on the women's piece (whatever I'd turns
out to be).

Your final schedule has not been resolved, and no firm commitment has been made on your doing a separate women's
event to announce the US commitment to women in the Pacific. The Aussies and NZ are supporting the travel of key
women leaders to the Cook Islands to highlight the gender initiative. They have expressed concern that you might not
join all of them for a gender announcement. Gillard is now staying over on Friday. It is true, she will have made a huge
Aussie gender commitment earlier at the Forum, but the Aussies and Kiwis want to unveil the Cook Islands initiative for
women of the Pacific with you to demonstrate the ongoing commitment (and new resources)by all of you that you first
announced in PNG.
We have been working with all the governments, including with Amanda, but final decisions on your schedule are still a
work in progress. Gender is one of the key themes of this Pacific Forum, and given your leadership on this issue, the
other govts were eager to underscore their collective commitment with you to this when you are there on Friday.

See the email below from Jan Piercy who's been in the Pacific, most recently in New Zealand. Her message is confusing.

Amanda Ellis is the minister for development from NZ. I thought the reason we weren't doing a separate women's event
at the PIF was because Gillard wanted to make her own big gender announcement.

As Melanne well knows, we put gender events on the map in the Pacific. I don't want to be seen as abandoning them
now.

And we certainly have the time to do such an event.
So, what's the story? â€¢

Amazingly, I just ran into Amanda ellis in the ANZ airport lounge about to depart for the Cook Islands as I head back to
the US. She said that the gender events are off your schedule. Pis, pls revisit this if at all possible. Your presence will
make all the difference in underscoring significance of focus on gender in this convening. Hope this works out, and hope
change inschedule does not reflect any problems, tho how cld u not be utterly exhausted at this point?
Sending best thoughts, Jan
