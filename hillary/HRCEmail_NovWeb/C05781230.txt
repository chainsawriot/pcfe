Positive comments:
   • you look beautiful — I know that's not suppose to matter but it does
   • you look in command and relaxed — even though you likely are not
   • the crew respects you — you don't have to earn that so kudos to you.

Opportunities:
   1. Ask Michael Sheehan to tape you so you can watch yourself with him;




Proud of you
