Dear Cheryl, Robert, and Brock,

I thought you might enjoy this picture of Kay being delighted to receive the letter from Secretary Clinton this
morning, with IAF CEO and President Robert Kaplan (left), and Ambassador Tom Dodd, Vice Chair of the IAF
Board (right). Again, we are very grateful for your kind assistance in making it happen!

At the Board meeting, we also received a terrific briefing from Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for
Western Hemisphere Affairs John D. Feeley, which I know the Directors all appreciated very much.

Best,

Paul

Hi Cheryl,

Here is our proposed text:

***
To the Members of the Inter-American Foundation Board of Directors and Advisory Council:

It is my pleasure to send my sincere congratulations and best wishes to Kay Kelley Arnold, both personally and
on behalf of the United States Department of State, on the occasion of her successful completion of more than
twelve years of service on the Board of Directors of the IAF.

Kay has distinguished herself as an American and true public servant. I know that the Foundation, the American
people, and grassroots communities across Latin America and the Caribbean have benefitted greatly from her
steady leadership and vision, and that they will continue to do so as she transitions to her new role as Vice Chair
of the IAF Advisory Council.

Kay, thank you for your many years of dedicated service to the IAF and the nation.

** *




Thanks so much for this Cheryl! Let me know if there is anything further I can do to facilitate.

Best,

Paul

Dear Paul

So nice to connect again!

David is still schooling in basketball but he has been reduced to doing that to his 7 year-old kidlets!

Happy to do a note — do you have a recommended text?

Best.

Hey Cheryl,

First, by way of re-introduction, we first met years ago when you and David hosted James Forman and lfy's pre-wedding
party. My wife Diana Wells and I are old friends of James' from Brown University, and David regularly schooled me at
hoops when we played pick up pre-kids (but don't tell him I said so). You also may know Diana from her work as Global
President of Ashoka: Innovators for the Public.

I am writing to you in my capacity as General Counsel of the Inter-American Foundation to request if Secretary Clinton
would be able to send a note of congratulations and good wishes to Kay Arnold on the occasion of her retirement from the
Board of Directors of the IAF. I understand Kay knows Secretary Clinton and President Clinton, who first appointed her to
IAF's Board in November 1999.

At IAF's next Board meeting, scheduled for December 10 of this year, we will present Kay with the attached resolution
honoring her service. I know it would mean a great deal to her if we could read a statement of good wishes from the
Secretary as part of her recognition.

Thank you for considering this request, and please do not hesitate to contact me if I can provide any additional
information. I have also attached a recent Joint Statement from USAID and IAF for your further background.

All the best,

Paul
