Charlie Rangel

                     cell

Rep. Charles Rangel won the Democratic nomination in his Harlem-based district, paving the way for a 22nd
term in Congress as he turned aside a crowded primary field.

With 84 percent of precincts reporting, Rangel led state Sen. Adriano Espaillat 45 percent to 40 percent. The AP
called the race for Rangel.


Sean Patrick Maloney
               cell
Sean Patrick Maloney won the Democratic primary to face Rep. Nan Hayworth (R), defeating Cortlandt Town
Councilman Rich Becker. Maloney garnered 7,098 votes, 49% of the vote, a total that equals the entire amount of votes
collected for the other four candidates in the race.

Nydia Velazquez

                     cell
Easily won a primary against New York City Councilman Erik Dilan, who had the backing of Brooklyn power broker Vito
Lopez in a district that took in significant chunks of Brooklyn in redistricting. With 97 percent of polls reporting last night,
Velazquez took 58 percent of the vote, crushing her strongest challenger, City Council member Erik Dilan, who had 31
percent.

Jeffries was favored by a Democratic establishment worried about some of Barron's resume, including having been a
member of the Black Panthers. Gov. Cuomo and Sen. Schumer both backed Jeffries in the primary. With 97 percent of
the vote in, Jeffries was garnering almost three times as many votes as Barron, leading 72 percent to 28 percent.




Grace Meng (number coming)

State Assemblywoman Grace Meng won the Democratic primary for retiring Rep. Gary Ackerman's seat,
beating fellow Assembly member Rory Lancman by 22 points with 89 percent of precincts reporting. Meng is
now primed to be New York's first Asian-American member of Congress.
