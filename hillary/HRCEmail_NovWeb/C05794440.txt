Subject                          Wilson speech



By the time I got up to speak, Jane Harmon and Christine Legarde had spoken a lot about me, them and women and
there didn't seem to be much of an appetite in the audience for a serious speech--always a problem at these dinners--so
I abbreviated Iran and Arab sections and skipped most of the section about women and made an appeal for the US still
showing we can get things done keying off Fred Malik's opening comments. And I had dozens of people on the way out
thank me and say how "inspirational" it was. Go figure.

Pis get me both a transcript of what I ended up saying and a copy of the campy film all the former Sec States made.
