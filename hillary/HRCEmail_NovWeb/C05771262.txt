Subject: Egyptians Agree

Jonathan, add any from PA as needed.

Zaki informed me from Cairo this afternoon that Egypt agrees to host on 14th and probably will announce it formally
tomorrow.

Question for the group is whether we want to announce Jerusalem on the 15th in same cycle or soon, and S travel.
David
