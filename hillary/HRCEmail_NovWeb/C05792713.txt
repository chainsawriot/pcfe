    Lance Armstrong is stepping down as chairman of the Livestrong cancer charity he founded in 1997 after
    recovering from the disease, a spokeswoman for the organization confirmed.

    The move comes a week after the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency said it had uncovered overwhelming evidence of
    Armstrong's involvement in a sophisticated doping program while a professional cyclist.

    Armstrong found out he had testicular cancer at age 25 when he was emerging as a rising star among cyclists.
    He started a small group to raise money for cancer called the Lance Armstrong Foundation in 1997. Since then,
    84 million bright yellow Livestrong wristbands have been distributed.
