House Clears Bill to Alter Insider Trading Law

The House cleared by unanimous consent a bill (S 3510) that would alter provisions of an insider trading law (PL 112-105)
enacted in April. The law prohibits lawmakers and employees in all three federal branches from trading stocks based on
confidential information. The Senate passed the measure earlier Thursday. It would change the spousal disclosure rule and
provide a one-month delay of online posting requirement, as called for by several former top-level government officials,
according to Senate aides.
