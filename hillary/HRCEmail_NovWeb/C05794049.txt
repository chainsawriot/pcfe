Tom -

State-of-play:

  MEK has accepted the UNAMI timeline (including arrival of Convoy 7/680 people at Hurriya by September 15, and the
residual group at Ashraf of 200 until 30 September and 100 after that to monitor property).

-- inspection of cargo for Convoy 7 has begun, but slowly and amid the usual arguments about what cargo is and is not
permitted. (In general, the 601 tries to limit heavy equipment going to Hurriya.)

- Kobler is working hard to facilitate contacts between the MEK and a businessman with whom the MEK had signed a
contract to sell movable property, e.g., cars and generators. Progress would ease Convoy 7 and help avoid problems
with the residual group at Ashraf. MEK signals are mixed, including hostility to the businessman.

Our immediate task is to get Convoy 7 done by 15 September. It will be a cliff hanger. We have two "spare" days and
may well need them. After October 1, we can pivot to resettlement, though property issues (and wrap up of the
residual group) will remain.

Next steps:

-- push the GOI to provide needed trucks and busses to meet the agreed timetable for Convoy 7. Embassy Baghdad is on
this, but may need support.

-- push GOI and MEK to avoid protracted wrangling or maximal positions on contentious but relatively minor issues
related to Convoy 7 (e.g., cargo).

-- monitor progress on property sale, but avoid direct involvement for the present. (Liability and "material support"
concerns).

Steve Beecroft knows the issue and has been helpful throughout; he knows that we may need him to push hard over the
next days. We may also need Bill Burns's help when he is in Baghdad.
