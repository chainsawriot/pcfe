Dear Laurent

We will follow-up with thoughts and a suggested framework for the energy summit for your consideration and
decision. I will work with our team to get you something in the next week.

And when I was at the IDB event, I mentioned it both to Agustin Aguerre (IDB) and to Alex Abrantes (WB) so we will
follow-up.

Best.
