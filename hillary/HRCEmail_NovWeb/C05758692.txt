Cheryl,




There are 18 employees whose names I recently sent over to PPO to convert from Tern ora Schedule C to Regular
Schedule C or SES status who have not yet been approved by PPO. (One of them is           who has actually been   B6
over for quite some time now).




                                                                                                                  B5




I wanted to make you aware that this was going on.




Heather
