1. (SBU) Summary. President Martelly and representatives from Parliament's bicameral commission on
November 30 agreed on a framework to form a Transitional College of the Permanent Electoral Council
("College Transitoire du Conseil Electoral Permanent", CT/CEP) which will organize partial senate and local
elections. The understanding-in-principle establishes the framework for a formal agreement that will set in
motion the organization of elections. The parties further demonstrated their determination to keep matters on
track on December 2, when they held talks focused on resolving a key element: replacing the.Superior Judicial
Council's (CSPJ) three original — and controversial — CEP representatives (Ref. A) with three others a
unanimous CSPJ subsequently selected (Ref. B). End Summary.
