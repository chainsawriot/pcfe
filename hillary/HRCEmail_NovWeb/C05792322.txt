         Statement by President Bill Clinton on Governor Mitt Romney's New Television Advertisement

New York, NY-Governor Romney released an ad today alleging that the Obama administration had weakened the work
requirements of the 1996 Welfare Reform Act. That is not true.

The act emerged after years of experiments at the state level, including my work as Governor of Arkansas beginning in
1980. When I became President, I granted waivers from the old law to 44 states to implement welfare to work strategies
before welfare reform passed.

After the law was enacted, every state was required to design a plan to move people into the workforce, along with more
funds to help pay for training, childcare and transportation. As a result, millions of people moved from welfare to work.

The recently announced waiver policy was originally requested by the Republican governors of Utah and Nevada to
achieve more flexibility in designing programs more likely to work in this challenging environment. The Administration has
taken important steps to ensure that the work requirement is retained and that waivers will be granted only if a state can
demonstrate that more people will be moved into work under its new approach. The welfare time limits, another important
feature of the 1996 act, will not be waived.

The Romney ad is especially disappointing because, as governor of Massachusetts, he requested changes in the welfare
reform laws that could have eliminated time limits altogether. We need a bipartisan consensus to continue to help people
move from welfare to work even during these hard times, not more misleading campaign ads.
