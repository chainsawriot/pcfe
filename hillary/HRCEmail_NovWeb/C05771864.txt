Sorry, I had asked Jake and Cheryl to forward this to you since I was having trouble accessing your email form my
blackberry but they may not have gotten the message either. I'll also forward his message to Raj.

In Buenos Aires at the moment. The trip seems to have gone well so far. Not surprisingly given next year's election, the
atmosphere is highly charged. My speech seems to have been well received by both sides in the media debate so it looks
like we managed to thread the needle on that one.

Hope you are managing to get some down time on your vacation. I go to Uruguay tomorrow, Chile on Tuesday and back
to DC on Friday.

Cheers,

JM

Raj:

Hope the trip went well. You may have already seen the attached article but in light of our recent conversations I
wanted to forward it on to you.




Please know that I will help you in any way I can to deal with this situation.

Look forward to discussing it further when you return.
