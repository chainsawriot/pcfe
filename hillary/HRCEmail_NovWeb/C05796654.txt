Subject: Thank you

Cheryl,

Thank you for being GLIFAA's abiding advocate. You always have our backs and we are truly grateful for that.

Your Winne the Pooh story resonated with many but your statement about one of Secretary Clinton's most enduring
principles of trying to live up to one's God-given potential resounded with me particularlyâ€”H



So I wanted to say thank you again for everything you have and will continue to do for our communities all for those
who struggle for equality. What an honor it is to have you.

Regards,

David

P.S- with only a few months left, I hope to book you in advance for our Pride Month in June because I know your
schedule is always packed!
