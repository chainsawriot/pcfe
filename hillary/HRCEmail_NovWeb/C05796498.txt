Subject: Annan urges UN to warn Syria of consequences (AP)

UNITED NATIONS - (AP) International envoy Kofi Annan is calling on the UN Security Council to send a
message to both the Syrian government and the opposition there -- that there will be "consequences" if they
don't comply with demands for an immediate cease-fire.
  That word comes from a UN diplomat, following a videoconference briefing by Annan from Geneva.
