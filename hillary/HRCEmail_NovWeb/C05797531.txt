Subject: Good morning

Madam Secretary,
Good morning, about 6:30am, from Amman headed to airport to go to Baghdad. Agreement at E3+3 meeting last night
that Cathy will begin and then I will lay out details of proposal. Sergey Ryabkov will then make some very useful points
before Jalili is asked to respond. Maliki and Talabani have told Jim Jeffrey that if plenary goes well, U.S. bilat likely;we'll
see, I'm still skeptical. Think we are well prepared and ready to go, U.S. Senate action and yesterday's sandstorm in
Baghdad not withstanding! Will keep you posted.
Best,
Wendy
