Cheryl,

WH has indicated we are limited to either the Secretary +1, or a single seat if she is unable to attend. Would you prefer
Pat to attend, or Dan? Thanks, JB

As you can see from below, this week's session is on Benghazi. I'm told both Ds and P are out Monday. I'm happy to
cover, as I have in the past, but, assuming she doesn't want to do it, thought this might be of interest for you. Could also
contact Pat. Please advise.
