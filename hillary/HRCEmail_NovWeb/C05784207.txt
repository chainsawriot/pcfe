Thanks - we are bumping up against a time deadline for being able to identify a replacement who can be confirmed so I

Hi Cheryl-- I am in LA-- returning tomorrow. I have one more meeting at GU to iron things down-- most people were out
last week because of Easter. Would be good if we could announce next week so that I can also prepare key folks in the
Bureau. Does that work?? Best, Arturo

Arturo

I am just following up to see whether you are still on track to announce your return to G-Town this week?

Best.
