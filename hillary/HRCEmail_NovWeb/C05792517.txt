Figured there was a high likelihood. If you're home you can obviously check. But I bet I can figure it out. Give me a bit,

If you have Comcast, it's channel 339 or 340 (one is HD and one isn't)

If you don't have Comcast, I can look it up

Hey, I need some help:

Do you know what channel on the TV in DC is the program listing? And, specifically, what channel number is Showtime?
