Just talked to Ryan, who was sitting with McCain and Allen in his residence. He welcomed the news of the S-Khar call,
and the DCC decision. If S wants to try to reach McCain, per the roll-out strategy, Ryan said she could do so through post
or even his personal cell phone. Can you pls let her specials know?
