Huma,

FYI-- I mentioned this article to S this morning and she requested a copy.

Keystone XL pipeline expansion driven by oil-rich tar sands in Alberta (Washington Post)
Every day, fleets of these Brobdingnagian trucks are digging up countless tons of Alberta's oil sands â€” a black,
gooey mixture of sand, oil and water that lies just below the Canadian province's boreal forest, an immense
region thick with jack pines, spruce, aspen and tamarack trees and fed by wetlands that cover most of the area.
