Mike Hammer is apparently obsessed with the color purple. You have a line in your remarks about it ("I'm just happy this
isn't a Friday, because I know your policy of Purple Friday, but I don't think I have any pantsuits in that color").

Obviously works whether you want to wear a purple item or not but sounds like Toria will bring a bunch of purple pieces
for you and other folks to wear for the ceremony.
