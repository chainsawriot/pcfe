Talked to Anne, who will join S call at noon. Anne will think further, but her initial instinct on travel timing was to
recommend S coming a little later in July, to let new govt est itself and also be in better position with Hill to outline
serious econ package. Her view may change by 12, and it's not a call that has to be made today. I'm happy to go before
or after 5, whatever works best.
