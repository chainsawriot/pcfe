  Re: Evidence of Unmet Demand for Small Business Finandng



  In response to your request for data on unmet demand for small business financing, my team at OFN
  pulled together some data. The first section presents recently announced data from familiar sources. The
  second section, incorporating data provided by the Small Business Administration (SBA) to OFN today,
  drills down a little bit, using publicly available FDIC data. Finally, I cite some data from OFN's "Market
  Conditions Report," our quarterly survey of market conditions. The sample size is modest, but it is far and
  away the best data on CDFI market conditions. For what it's worth, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben
  Bernanke has cited "Market Conditions Report" in speeches.

  I hope this is at least a start on what you need. Please let me know if you need additional information.


  Recent Data

        Si NYSE Survey of Small Business Credit: "Nearly half of the 285 U.S. small business owners
           surveyed in a poll (pdf) released this week by the New York Stock Exchange (NYX) say they have
           marginal or no access to the capital they need to expand their businesses. As a consequence,
           two-thirds of them do not expect to add jobs in 2013." (emphasis added)

        Si Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Small Business Borrowers Poll of 544 businesses
            released earlier this month shows that of those companies (in the NY Fed's footprint) that did
            apply for credit, a majority got some financing, but only 13 percent got the full amount they
            requested. In addition, banks in the New York Fed's region are still hesitant to offer loans,
            particularly loans less than $100,000.

        hi Federal Reserve Bank of SF: Small bank portfolios of business loans under $1 million (in the
            SF Fed's footprint) are shrinking, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco
            report. About one in seven small businesses uses credit from a small bank.

  SBA Data

  The SBA runs multiple programs to subsidize and support small business lending. In June, OFN hosted a
  Small Business Finance Forum that featured the SBA to help it try to get traction in small business
  lending. The reasons? See the data below, which was provided directly to OFN today but which has been
  presented publicly, as well.
