Ayotte wrong to sink Law of Sea Treaty
By Monitor  staff
July 18, 2012 Updated 1 minutes ago
On Monday, New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Ohio Sen. Rob Portman announced that they were joining
the 32 other Republican senators who have already sworn to block Senate ratification of the international Law
of the Sea Treaty. Their decision - one based more on election-season politics than legitimate concerns - is
unfortunate. Not ratifying the 1982 treaty, which has been signed by 162 nations, puts the United States at a

disadvantage economically, endangers the environment and makes it more likely that disputes will be settled by
military means. Every president since Ronald Reagan recognized that and saw it in America's interest to sign
the treaty.
The debate over whether to sign the treaty exposed an interesting division among Republicans. Internationalists
and pragmatists in the party, along with business interests as evidenced by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's
support for ratification, see the pact as a way to maximize U.S. influence over the world's oceans while
minimizing the need for armed conflict. Republicans leery of international cooperation and fearful of "one-
world government" see signing the treaty as ceding U.S. sovereignty to a tribunal that's numerically dominated
by Third World nations. Ayotte, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has joined the latter
group.
In their letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Ayotte and Portman said, "The real issue is not whether the
United States will defend its maritime rights, but rather who will have the final say on the scope of those rights.
We simply are not persuaded that decisions by the International Seabed Authority and international tribunals
empowered by this treaty will be more favorable to U.S. interests than bilateral negotiations, voluntary
arbitration, and other traditional means of resolving maritime issues," the senators said. America's maritime
interests are best served, the duo said, not by a treaty but by "maintaining U.S. naval power beyond challenge."
Gunboat diplomacy, however, is the wrong approach to what has become a gold rush on the high seas. Climate
change and the melting of the Arctic sea ice has fueled a race to claim the enormous stores of natural gas and oil
beneath that area's seabed. All over the globe, China, Russia and other nations with the means and know-how
are staking claims to trillions of dollars worth of ore rich in gold, silver, copper, cobalt and other precious
metals that forms in areas with volcanic springs. One of those areas is in international waters off the coast of
Hawaii.
Because it hasn't signed the treaty - it is the only major nation that hasn't done so - the United States doesn't
have a place at the table while the rules for undersea mining are being set.
"As the world's pre-eminent maritime power with one of the longest coastlines, the U.S. has more than any
other country to gain - and to lose - based on how the convention's terms are interpreted and applied. . . . The
continuing delay of U.S. accession to the convention compromises our nation's authority to exercise our
sovereign interest, jeopardizes our national and economic security, and limits our leadership role in international
ocean policy."
So said five former secretaries of state, Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, James Baker 11I, Colin Powell and
Condoleezza Rice in a joint essay published recently in The Wall Street Journal. Their collective wisdom was
lost on the current crop of Republicans in the Senate who view cooperation as , a sign of weakness.
Since it takes 67 Senate votes to ratify a treaty, Ayotte and Portman's letter doomed any chance that the current
Congress will do so. The answer to that, and plenty of other problems, is to elect a different Congress.
