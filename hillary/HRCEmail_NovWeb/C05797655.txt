Subject: Denmark TIP

Here's a good explanation of Denmark's TIP issue. Basically they have a more complicated process for offering victims
the possibility to remain in country. But ultimately J/TIP recognizes that this does not result in a worse record and
Denmark will almost certainly not/not be downgraded this year.

Details:
Unlike other European countries, Denmark does not have a special visa or residency permit for trafficking victims, and
thus does not condition permission to remain on cooperation with the police to pursue traffickers. Some think that
strategy results in more prosecutions. For undocumented victims in Denmark, options to remain are limited to asylum, a
humanitarian permit, or family reunification. These are rarely granted, though the Danish government is taking steps to
make sure victims are aware of these options. Most often, undocumented victims opt for "prepared return" during a 30-
100 day "reflection period," which includes comprehensive social assistance preparing in Denmark and assistance and
follow-up monitoring in the country of return. Undocumented victims who have been picked up for crimes who are not
identified as trafficking victims can enter deportation proceedings after 72 hours; other countries may have a longer
period to hold undocumented alleged lawbreakers before beginning such proceedings. Denmark is also unique in its
approach to social services, which are comprehensive and generous and extend to all victims regardless of whether they
participate in law enforcement proceedings against the traffickers. And unlike most countries in this period of austerity,
Denmark increased its budget for trafficking victim support by 23 percent (last year budgeting 56 million dollars for such
efforts).
