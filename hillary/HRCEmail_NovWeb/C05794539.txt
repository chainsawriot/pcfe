MS—
My heart is breaking this week for the whole extended state department family. What a terrible loss and unbelievable
heartbreak. Many of my old friends at the State Department who have moved onto other posts wrote to me to tell me
how moved they were by your remarks. I watched it from here on the west coast with great sadness. I am sure that
your remarks also meant a great deal to the families of the victims.

"My" Bill is going to see "your" Bill tomorrow afternoon. I was hoping this might happen in our offices in the suburbs so I
could say hello, but they're going to meet up instead over at the convention center in downtown seattle. Since Bill
never uses staff when he is "off-campus" in Seattle, I will miss seeing the WJC team, but I hope he has a successful
trip. It's the best time of year to be out here — picture-perfect weather and breathtaking views of the mountains.

I think of you (and the whole team) often and love keeping up with your travels on the news and the State Department
facebook posts!

Hugs,
Lauren

Dear Lauren--

I loved this story about your meeting Warren. He is a really nice man in addition to everything else he is. And, I was so
pleased to see you when you dropped by the Department.

Hope you are thriving and staying dry! We all miss you but are very proud of you. Please give my best wishes to your
family--

As ever, H

Hi Madame Secretary,
I just wanted to tell you that Warren Buffett is here today for the Microsoft CEO Summit; he asked me who I worked for
before I worked for Bill. When I told him it was YOU, he said "she's my heroine!" Then I laughed and he said, "no — she
really is!"
We all feel that way 0 Hope you are well.

Lauren
