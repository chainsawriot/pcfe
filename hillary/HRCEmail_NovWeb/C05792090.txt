Dear Cheryl,



First thanks again for the great support for Grameen and Professor Yunus. Professor Yunus will
be traveling to Mexico through the US on September 6 accompanied by                                                      B3 INA

                                                                                                                   B3 INA

                                       His visa application confirmation and embassy entry token are
attached. Sometimes this process goes well and sometimes there are delays for administrative processing

It would be great if he can get a 5 year in time to accompany Professor Yunus to Mexico. Please let me know
if there anything more I can do on this and if there is someone in Dhaka I should be contacting on this so we do
not need to take so much of your valuable time.



The request from Yunus and his staff follows below.

Sincerely,




Vidar




Dear Vidar:

I am glad to let you know that finally today                                                                       B3 INA


Thanks for your continued support.

Best regards

Tanbir

Dear Vidar:

I will be travelling to Mexico on September 6 to attend an event and one staff of Yunus Centre will be
accompanying me.
Mexico doesn't have an embassy in Bangladesh and Bangladeshi national requires travelling to Delhi for
Mexican visa.

However if he has a US visa he can get a Mexican visa on arrival. If he travels through USA he'll need a US
visa.

My colleague who will accompany me is                                                                           He B3 INA
needs to apply for US visa for this he needs an invitation letter and hotel details from your side. Tanbir will
provide you necessary information.

Can you help him in any other way to receive the US visa?

Yunus
