Subject                           Today



Hi, Everyone--


Bill told me last night he wants to be sure he's not late. Should we leave 30 minutes earlier--wheels up at 2:45 instead of
3:15? Or do you think he'll be ok w existing schedule?


One worry I have is that Service may freeze traffic on roads to Terry's which could stop you all from getting there on
time under current schedule.


What do you think?
