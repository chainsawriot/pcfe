Subject:                            speaking agency



I guess it would be too much to ask the world to put itself on hold for a hurricane; Princeton public schools are closed for
2 days and even the university is shutting down! Which means I have a moment to send you an email I've had on my to
do list for a while. I am sure that you may already have a speaking agency for when you are out of office; obviously WJC
has one. But I am about to switch to Royce Carleton, http://www.roycecarlton.com/, which is a very classy and
conscientious outfit that has a relatively small but very high quality roster, particularly in foreign affairs. They represent
both Fareed Zakaria and Tom Friedman, also Michael Sandel; I have met with them several times and have been very
impressed with their overall determination to find the right kinds of placements and to think through agendas with you.
I know that Carleton Sedgeley, their president, would love to talk with you if and when you are ready. His email is



Best,
AM
