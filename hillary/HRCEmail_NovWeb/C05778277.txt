Hillary,

I am ready to go. My CDC meetings with Tom Frieden, the head of Global Health and about 20 other
colleagues were excellent. They are very supportive of my arrival and have urged me to come as quickly as
possible. I am energized by this assignment and will also simply look forward to being in the Department to
help you in any way I can.

I have finished my paperwork

Matt and I will be at your CAP event on the 1.5.

I am in town on the 14 th and 15th andavailable to meet.

.I want you to know how much your leadership around Wikileaks has inspired people in the country. It
encourages them to overcome the unexpected challenges they face in ther own lives. And let's hope Richard is
alright.

Yours,
