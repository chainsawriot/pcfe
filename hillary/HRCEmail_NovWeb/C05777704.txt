   Subject:                           SPRAP and a few other things



   It occurs to me that yesterday I left out the most important thing I wanted to say which is to thank you for giving me this
   amazing opportunity. It is of course an honor to serve my country but it is a special privilege for me be able to do so as
   a member of your team. I am very proud of all that we have achieved over the past two years and I know that it would
   not have been possible without your leadership and support. I believe that your vision for 21st century diplomacy and
   your extraordinary efforts to achieve that vision has transformed our relationship with governments around the world
   and, most importantly, with people everywhere. So thank you for giving me this opportunity and thank you for all you
   do.

 • In terms of SRAP I was wondering if you have asked Paul Jones for some suggestions. He worked so closely with Richard
• that he may have some good ideas about possible candidates to succeed him, from both inside the Foreign Service as
   well as external candidates. I'd be happy to reach out to him if you would like. Am also trying to think of folks myself.

   Finally, I am scheduled to meet with Cheryl today and am assuming I can share everything with her, correct ?

   Take care.
