STATEMENT: John Podesta on the Passing of CAP Founding Director Marion Sandler

June 2, 2012

Washington, D.C. — Today as the Center for American Progress mourns the loss of Marion Sandler, our dear friend and a
Founding Director of the Center for American Progress, John Podesta issued the following statement:

Marion Sandler was a pioneering woman in finance, a coach and conscience for progressive organizations, and a tough-
minded woman of enormous decency who tried to make government and business more responsive to the needs of
ordinary Americans.

In each station of her life—from Maine where she was raised, to New York where she was a path-breaking woman in the
financial world and met Herb Sandler, to many years in California where they built and ran a highly regarded business
and raised a beautiful family together—Marion Sandler lived the American dream.

She gave back her resources and devoted her talents through extraordinary philanthropy. She not only helped launch
the Center for American Progress, but gave us our name and trained us to pay attention to excellence, credibility, and
building for the long-term.

Marion also had a well-earned reputation for being tough. Talking to her about a new idea or program often felt like
defending a doctoral dissertation, but she could also be incredibly warm, kind, and thoughtful. I never left a
conversation with Marion without some of her wisdom and charm rubbing off on me. She was a remarkable woman,
mother, partner, and friend.

Marion left this world, as she had wanted, having done all she could to expand opportunities for ordinary Americans,
particularly the left out and the left behind, so they could lift up their own lives and receive a better break from the way
business and government served them.

We will miss her. We embrace. Herb Sandler and their children, Susan and Jim and their families, as they experience this
great loss.
