Oh Canada! (1) — We added some background on our trip to Canada last week for Under Secretary Sherman's meeting
tomorrow with Canadian Political Director Kerry Buck and Neil Reeder, the Director General for the Americas. I met with
Reeder in Ottawa, but have not met Ms. Buck, who is taking over much of the WHA portfolio from John Allen as
Canada's foreign Ministry reorganizes in the face of a ten per cent budget cut under the new conservative
government. I have a meeting later in the day tomorrow, at 3:30 with these two. It's a little late to be asking you this,
but do want to see them or drop by my meeting?

Oh Canada! (2) (SBU) — I want to give you a little more of the flavor of our meetings in Canada. As part of the budget
cutting at the Foreign Ministry, the counterpart office to mine in will drop from 11 people to 4. Still lots of people
working in their AID Ministry (CIDA), and their equivalent to INL (START), but all new projects for Haiti have been frozen
while they conduct their review of Haitian policy. What's at stake here is Canada's "normal" annual support for Haiti of
$100 million a year. I was told the most important meeting was with Steven Farber, FM Baird's Senior Policy
Advisor. About halfway through my pitch to him, which he seemed to like (basically why leave Haiti now that it is finally
showing promise of getting its governmental act together), he asked to be excused for a minute so he could see if
someone else could attend the meeting. He returned with the Cheryl Mills of Canada, Garry Keller, who is Chief of Staff
to Baird, so I started all over and he seemed to like the message too.
                                                                                                                                B1
                                                      They also are anxious to justify their activities in Haiti by promoting   1.4(D)
Canadian business opportunities there. They don't seem to have much going in this regard, except for the new mining
possibilities. I said that we were very much open to anyone taking advantage of the industrial park and would be glad to
arrange for a group of Haitian businessmen who would be travelling to Haiti in the next few weeks to visit Caracol and
discuss opportunities there with Mark D'Sa and relevant Haitian interlocutors.

(SBU) I was a little astonished at how openly the career folks at the foreign and assistance ministries disliked their new
political masters and wanted us to convince them not to cut Haiti. In my many years here I have never seen such open
disloyalty with a change of administrations. Although the political appointees told me there was no need to have the
Secretary talk to Baird about Haiti, the senior career folks, on the margins, implored me to have this done.

On funding, I brought up the $2 million funding gap caused by the delay in reaching agreement with the GOH on a
second civil registry project. CIDA told me they would look to see if they could plus up their elections contributions to
make up for this shortfall.

Mark Schneider — And yes, I raised Mark Schneider's complaint about his $250,000 grant not being renewed and was
told that it had not been turned down, but was caught up in the freeze on new projects and could come unthawed. I
called Mark and told him this. He thanked us for raising it and said their plan was to keep their office in Port-au-Prince

open for a little while longer while it completed work on two papers, one on MINUSTAH and the other on the upcoming
elections and then close it down if the funding did not come through and cover Haiti from their Washington office.
