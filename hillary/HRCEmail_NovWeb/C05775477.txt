(U) The Department of Justice has arrested and indicted a Pakistani-born U.S. citizen on charges of planning bombings at
Metrorail stations in the Washington, D.C., area. A grand jury charged Farooque Ahmed on Tuesday with "attempting to
provide material support to a designated terrorist organization, collecting information to assist in planning a terrorist attack
on a transit facility, and attempting to provide material support to help carry out multiple bombings," according to a Justice
Department press statement. Instead of real al-Qaida agents, Ahmed met with undercover FBI agents.
