Dear Prime Minister,



We salute and thank you for your decision to host the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland. Coming just over a year
after you accompanied Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth on her historic and wonderful visit to the Republic of
Ireland, the decision demonstrates your great commitment to achieving peace and reconciliation across the
island of Ireland. Recent events show how important that commitment is, along with the continuing
involvement of all of us who share your objective of completing the Peace Process.

It is particularly appropriate that you are bringing the G8 Summit to Enniskillen. It recognizes this lovely town
that suffered so grievously. Hosting the Summit in Enniskillen presents an opportunity to highlight the success
of the Peace Process while providing it with a much needed morale boost. This could be achieved by
recognizing a key architect of the Peace Process and a steadfast friend of Great Britain and Ireland, President
Bill Clinton.



Enniskillen is President Clinton's ancestral home and the location of the Clinton Centre, which celebrates the
crucial role the President played in the Peace Process. He has visited the Centre on several
occasions. Recently, The American Ireland Fund initiated a program at the Centre where students from areas in
conflict such as Kosovo, Bosnia, Egypt, Haiti, Israel and Palestine come together to envision a future based on
the Clinton legacy of peace and prosperity. The success of the program has led to its expansion and it is being
hailed as an exemplar for societies in conflict.



Thus, to celebrate the new Northern Ireland and to encourage continued support of the journey towards a fully
normalized society, we would deeply appreciate if, in conjunction with the Summit â€” ideally on its eve, Sunday,
June 16th, you would honor President Clinton by unveiling a tribute to the new Northern Ireland in his presence.



We would be most grateful for your consideration of this request. We believe it would be a strong signal of
support for the Peace Process at a time of unprecedented worldwide attention on Northern Ireland.
