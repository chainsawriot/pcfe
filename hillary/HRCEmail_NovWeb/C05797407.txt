Subject: UPDATE: Hillary Clinton leaves New York hospital with family, aide (Reuters)

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was driven away from New York-Presbyterian
hospital on Wednesday with her husband, Bill, and daughter, Chelsea, and an aide, a Reuters photographer
witnessed.

    The four of them left the building and entered the same vehicle, which drove away.

  It was unclear where she was going or whether she was discharged from the hospital, where she was
admitted for treatment of a blood clot.

    A hospital spokeswoman has directed all comment on Clinton to the State Department.
