So very sad. Can you find out the names of his children whom I met so I can write them (and his wife, if appropriate).

Economist's D.C. chief dies in car crash

Peter David, The Economist's Washington bureau chief and Lexington columnist, died in a car accident on Thursday
night, the magazine reports today.

David had been with the London-based magazine for 28 years. He became British political editor and Bagehot columnist
in 1998 and then foreign editor in 2001, before assuming the D.C. bureau chief chair in 2009. As author of the Lexington
column, he wrote frequently about U.S. politics and business.

"He had worked at The Economist since 1984 and was a much-loved colleague and friend," the editors said in a
statement on the magazine's homepage. "We will pay fuller tribute to him in next week's issue."

"Peter was a wise, kind and experienced veteran of the best kind of international journalism," Ed Luce, the Financial
Times' chief U.S. commentator and a friend of David's, told POLITICO via email. "He was clearly relishing what was to be
his last job before retiring from the Economist. This is a horrible tragedy."

David's final column for the magazine, published in the current issue, addressed theories of American decline.

"On a variety of objective measures, it is in an awful mess right now," he concluded. "And yet America of all countries
still has plenty of grounds to hope for a better future, despite its underperforming politics, and no matter who triumphs
in November."
