Subject: My trip last week

Jake,

I drove from Washington to Denver this last week



As a result, while such dramatic events were happening around the world, I had an opportunity to see how the
Secretary's leadership was received outside of Washington. She is revered by ordinary Americans across the country
who see in her a dedication to their well-being. They see her as a person of good judgment truly committed to them in
the midst of a world that is changing rapidly in ways that are confusing and concerning. She has an immense reservoir
of trust and good will.

I hope that this sustains you a bit too.

Yours,

Lois
