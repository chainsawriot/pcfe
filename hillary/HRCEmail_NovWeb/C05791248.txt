Subject: Special investigator dies in Palestinian custody (AP)

RAMALLAH (AP) - A Palestinian judicial official says a special investigator tracking Palestinians who sell
land to Israelis has died in custody under mysterious circumstances.
   The official said Monday that 49-year-old Osama Mansour fell from the third floor of the Palestinian military
intelligence building in the West Bank city of Ramallah, where he was held. It's unclear what caused Sunday's
fatal fall.
   The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the case. He says Mansour
was working in the attorney general's office and was arrested 25 days ago.
   Palestinians convicted of selling land to Israelis face the death penalty. Palestinian society views such acts as
treason because it weakens their quest for an independent state in the West Bank and other lands Israel occupied
in 1967.
