I agree with     doing this - she is quite good so saying yes unless you have other thoughts.

Subject: Update on H1N1




Dear Cheryl:

To update you on H1N1 and make a recommendation as we move forward.

I have asked             to take the lead in the H1N1 negotiations, and she has been participating in the meetings
with WH, HHS, DOD and others. At this time, she is leading the discussions with other donors — UK,
Australia, Swiss and others — so they can work in a coordinated fashion under our leadership. Her expertise and
knowledge in this area has really helped in interacting with HHS and addressing the technical issues. She has
also participated in meetings with Jack Lew. I expect that this effort will require a considerable amount of her
time for the next few weeks.

With the departure of     and because we are in the middle of                                                        B5
recommend that we name                                                                         Based on this         B6
topic and growing importance of health diplomacy we are discussing ways to elevate and strengthen the health
function within OES. We hope to establish a Health Directorate, and expect to have that in place in
approximately six months. This responsibility could then be transferred to the Health DAS. I have discussed
this with           and she is in agreement.

I would be happy to talk about this if useful.

Many thanks, and hope you get some rest this weekend!

Maria
