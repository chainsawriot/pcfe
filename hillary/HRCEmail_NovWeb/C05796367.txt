Subject: Fwd: Youth Delegate Pilot Program Launched

See email below. There are some extremely excited youth around town. Bill Gaither's grandson is one of them.
He and Angela, who sent out the below email, have dropped by my office several times over past year or so
seeking ideas and advice for their advocacy. I've so enjoyed offering my experience to their cause...

       Subject: Youth Delegate Pilot Program Launched

       Dear USYDI Supporters,

       I am pleased to announce on behalf of the USYDI that the US Department of State launched on
       Thursday, August 23rd their first ever US Youth Observer Program that will send one US youth
       between the ages of 18 and 25, chosen through an open application process, to the 67th Session
       of the United Nations General Assembly. This program is anticipated to act as a pilot for a full
       US youth delegate program launch in 2013.

       After advocating for the creation of a US Youth Delegate Program with the USYDI for almost
       two years, this news comes with great congratulations to the US Department of State for its
       excellent steps forward in realizing active youth representation at the international stage and with
       sincerest thanks to all those of you who advocated along side of us with your letters of support,
       your time, or your ideas. We could not have advocated more strongly without your support, and
       we take this pilot program's launch to be a great sign of the positive outcome mobilized support
       for change can have. Thank you to each and every one of you who made the vision and dream of
       active representation of US youth voices at the international stage a reality.

           Though we are extremely excited at these great steps forward, we also recognize that in order to
           realize a full and effectively representative youth delegate program, many hours and much
           thought will be necessary for the growth and development of the program in the months ahead.
           As such, I would like to call on your support once more as we do our best to help make this
           program the most successful it can be through two requests:

     1. If you are between the ages of 18 and 25, please apply to the program at
        http://www.unausa.org/membership/us-youth. Applications are due by September 7th.
        We would love to see you as the first US Youth Observer!
     2. For everyone, if you are willing and able, please share this news with your networks
        and all those who you think may be interested in spreading the word or applying for the
        program. The greater the awareness for the program, the larger the applicant pool is likely
        to be, and the more representative of US youth the selected candidate can be. This
        element to the program's success is integral, and any support you can offer would be
        greatly appreciated. Feel free to forward this email, post on your Facebook, Tweet about
        it, sing a song about it, play a soccer game in honor of it, or share the news any other way
        you can think of.

  For more information, please visit to the United Nations Association of the US page at:
  http://www.unausa.org/membership/us-youth, and to the US Department of State's Official Blog
  at http://blogs.state.gov/index.php/site/entry/youth observer un_general assembly.

  Thank you again for all of your help, and we hope to see you at the 67th Session of the United
  Nations General Assembly!

  Sincerely,
  Angela Schopke
