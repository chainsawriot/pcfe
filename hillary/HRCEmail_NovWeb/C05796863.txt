Cheryl,


Claudia and I send our prayers and very best wishes to Hillary. I know you are getting thousands of these messages, but
we write to add our voices to the chorus of concern and support.

When all is well - and I'm sure it will be - perhaps we can have our lunch.

All the best in the New Year.

Jeff.
