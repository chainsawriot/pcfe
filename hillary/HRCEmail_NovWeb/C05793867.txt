Let me know if you are okay with her starting on Monday. She's coming
on as a SGE (not full-time).

Hi, Heather.

My major work obligation ends today and I'll have more time to help as best as I can. Can we check in if we need to, or
otherwise make arrangements for me to come in on Monday. I'd appreciate it.

Let me know and thanks.

Best,
Kelly
