 Clinton Scholarship Program

 The Clinton Scholarship Program was created in 2000 at USAID to provide
 funding for Palestinians to attend Masters programs in the United States. The
 program's name was changed twice in 2003, first to the Master's Degree
 Scholarship Program and then to the Presidential Scholarship Program. The
 Program ended in 2008.

 Background:

 According to a 2008 USAID evaluation of the program, the Clinton Scholarship
 Program (CSP) was implemented in 2000 implemented by the Academy for
 Educational Development (AED). The Program sought to contribute to Palestinian
 economic and social development by providing Master's degree training to
 promising Palestinians to address the shortage of qualified managers in the
 business, public administration, health, urban planning, law and engineering
 sectors.

 In 2003, the program was renamed the Master's Degree Scholarship Program
 (MDSP and continued with the same recruiting practices, goals and students
 supported. Altogether, the CSP/MDSP provided scholarships to 94 participants, of
 whom 89 successfully completed their Master's degrees.

  The initial contract ended in 2003 and a follow-on program was developed and
  renamed the Presidential Scholarship Program (PSP). PSP became a component of
  the Higher Education Support Initiative (HESI), a project implemented in Palestine
  also by AED. The program included the original masters programs areas and
  added new areas for scholarships in the IT, environmental sciences and education
  sectors. The ended in 2008. In total, 69 Palestinians successfully completed their
  Master's degrees through PSP, bringing the total output for the two programs to
  158 Master's degree recipients.

  Although the recruitment process placed an emphasis on recruiting women, the
  Master's degree recipients included 36 percent women and 64 percent men.
  Recruitment of women posed a challenge given Palestinian societal reservations
  about women traveling and living alone. A number of women who had applied
  and been selected eventually withdrew due to family considerations.

  Data from USAID suggests that 84 percent of participants returned to Palestine to
  complete their two years' required service, and 80 percent of participants contacted
                                           1

 by the team currently reside in Palestine. Although the data does not represent the
 entire universe of participants, it suggests a large percentage of participants are
 living and working in Palestine, contributing to the social and economic progress.

 USAID's evaluation of the Programs cites the scholarship programs as successful
 given the increase in participants' job opportunities, leadership roles, professional
 linkages and cultural exposure. Supplementary research is needed should this
 Administration seek to to reactivate the program.

 Note: A separate program, the Palestinian Faculty Development Program (PFDP),
 initiated in 2005 by USAID to increase capacity within the higher education sector
 in the West Bank and Gaza, is still active. It provides opportunities for professors
 to obtain doctoral degrees; it encourages teaching methods that involve active
 student participation; it introduces host country institutions to advances in
 educational technology; and, it encourages joint research and other linkages with
 U.S. universities.
