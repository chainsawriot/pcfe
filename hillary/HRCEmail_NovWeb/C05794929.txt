Subject: Best of luck on China trip

First, I want to wish you and Kurt best of luck getting out of the pickle Mr Chen has you in as you arrive in China. I
wanted to pass on something I intend to publish on Syria and Iran, because I think it is worth trying to urge the President
and his political advisers to act. As you can see from today's column by Jackson Diehl, the pundits and many in the
media will push the Syria issue very hard for the foreseeable future. It may not be on the front burner every day, but it
will be close to or at the top of the media's attention indefinitely. Interestingly, the Republicans have showed their hand
on the foreign policy debate, in which inaction on Syria is pretty much the only serious criticism they can offer that will
stick. As you will see from the attached piece, I believe that action on Syria will forestall the biggest danger on the
horizon, that Israel launches a surprise attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. Although the pressure has now eased for a
variety of reasons, it will return. Action by Washington on Syria, on the other hand, I believe will eliminate much of the
urgency for Israeli action. In other words, a more aggressive policy on Syria will eliminate the best case the republican's
have going into the November election, will ease substantially the pressure on Israel to attack Iran and possibly spark a
wider war in the Middle East, and finally would be the right stance on Syria going forward. I know you may not agree
but I thought it was better to share this with you first as at least a new way to look at the problem. All best, your friend,
Jamie
