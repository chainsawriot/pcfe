Dear Hillary,
I am so pleased you were able to visit with Kirk. As you can see below he loved meeting you. Another reason for you to
think Santa Fe when you want some down time.

With best wishes,
Joe

        Joe:

        Writing this while awaiting checkin at Turkish Air. Can never thank you enough for arranging that intro.
        Staff hawks were on the lookout for me, and I was able to meet Secretary Clinton before she made her
        entrance to the reception. What an amazingly down to earth, gracious person she is. No wonder she's
        been such an effective Secretary of State. I might just change professions.

                Thanks for the heads up about Kirk Ellis. I'm copying Lona to be sure I
                see him tomorrow.

                All the best to you and Valerie--

                Dear Hillary,
                I hope this finds you well and less exhausted, but I doubt the latter,
                knowing the pace you are keeping. I am writing to introduce you to our
                dear friend, Kirk Ellis, the writer of the John Adams PBS series, whom

               you will meet on May 24th at the Fine Arts Committee meeting on the 8th
               floor. He is brilliant, witty, entertaining, a true Renaissance man. He is
               a leader in the rich cultural and art world here in Santa Fe and a
               genuinely nice person.
               know that you will enjoy his company, however briefly your paths cross.

               Valerie joins me in wishing you all the best.

               Joe
