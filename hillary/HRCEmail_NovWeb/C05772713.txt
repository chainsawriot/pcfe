In regards to the campaign for women, we've got a great team and plan ready to go, but haven't been able to get the
necessary startup funding.

We've approached a few potential private investors, but they want to know State is formally committed before they say
yes. We have been working closely with Melanne for months, Kris Balderston is being helpful, and Raj's office has
suggested they may be able to assist -- but so far nothing has come of it.

$400k in startup capital is needed to get it off the ground. We have a draft MOU and funding proposal in at State, but
have not heard back. We need to get going this month if we are to have an event and web site ready by September for
Beijing+15.

As I understand things, you can help move it along by making it a clear priority to Jack Lew, who can carve out the
money to get it done quickly.

Raj is off to a brilliant start and thank you for the help you provided him.

 We share your assessment of Pakistan's need for a public narrative and better capacity to communicate effectively.
 Judith has been working on how we improve our comm work there, and I know you were talking to the Pakistani
 Ambassador about helping them. I'm copying Judith and asking that the two of you discuss what we could do given the
â€¢very difficult political landscape.

Thx for all your good counsel. We need to follow thru on the campaign for women we discussed some months back. Are
you still assisting Melanne? Let me know what I can do to hurry it along. H

Mme Secretary:

I'm glad I got to see you at Raj's swearing-in. Hope you liked the speech. Alonzo said we hit the right notes and Raj is off
to a strong start.

Of course I was kidding about "running away" from your "long list" of things you wanted to talk about with me. I'm
happy to talk anytime.

In fact, it would be good to touch base on the women's initiative and Pakistan. I've been talking with NDI's highly
regarded country director in Pakistan, who says communications is a desperate need and will definitely do some good
for the government.

Look forward to seeing you again soon. All the best, Doug
