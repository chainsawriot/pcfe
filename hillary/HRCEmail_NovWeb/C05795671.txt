Many thanks for the note. I'm fine, though still very much hope S and I can actually talk some of this through at some
point! Not until she leaves office, of course. I'll write her over the weekend.
All best,
AM

Anne-Marie - Please do NOT be devastated. There is a lot going on here and philippe has been pushing back hard. I know
cheryl is also calling you. Happy to talk.

Is she really talking about me? I have been 500 percent supportive and loyal in every possible way I can be? Can I at least
talk to her? I AM advocating for women!!
