Love it!- - Relief today is also a successful negotiation to get the Palestinians to back off of seeking change in status at
ATT conference. A long ordeal but working closely with Israelis, just achieved success. Rosemary DiCarlo and Tom
Countryman were fantastic duo; David Hale and many others played crucial supporting roles. Your trip on Friday key I
believe to this outcome. And on Istanbul, just sent following note to Bill, Denis and Jake:
Meeting has just ended, into the morning of July 4, Istanbul time. Bob and Gary are in an E3+3 caucus and then will call
in to debrief. They will remain available on July 4 for bilat but unlikely. Emails noted a very lively discussion/debate with
tough probing by our team. We have an E3+1 Political Directors call at 12:30pm tomorrow and an E3+3 call early
Thursday morning. Helga hopes to call Bagheri before week is out to set up next step (her meeting with him).
Hope you also get some relief on the 4th

Thanks for your kind words---and for all you do.

And, how do you spell "relief"? "GLOCS...".

Onward!

Subject: Thank you

Madam Secretary,
Thank you for your persistence on the issue of the Pakistan apology and the GLOCs. I know that it has finally come to a
close and also know this would not have occurred but for your constant efforts to make it thus. I have always been an
admirer, but working with you has deepened my admiration for your clarity, commitment and skill. Without you, this
chapter would still be incomplete.
Wendy
