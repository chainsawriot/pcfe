Cheryl,

As we discussed, I did talk to      at length earlier this week. He is pretty set on leaving government this fall, and has a
couple of good private sector offers before him. His reasoning is straightforward: upcoming college tuition, care for an
elderly mother, good possibilities on the outside. It's a loss for the Service, but he has thought it through. All best, Bill
