There was certainly no shortage of candidates from that exact demographic around the table today - so if anyone
wants to send their CV our way, she'll happily put in a good word with her boss...

But I am less happy than she is, because I did not get to ask my question. Taking advantage of your very nice email, I
pose it now:

Does the Secretary, who has long experience in American politics, and grew up in the era of the civil rights struggle, and
has lived in several areas of the country (Middle West, New England, Arkansas, Washington, and New York), and knows
America very well, believe that our society will ever evolve to the point at which a white male might realistically aspire
to become Secretary of State?

All -

While the last few weeks have certainly called my email etiquette into question, I have only fired off those rockets
when the situation required it. When I feel strongly about something, I say it. To hell with the consequences. I'm not
stopping now. And while this note may be another example of not learning my lesson, I feet compelled to be straight
with you about my equally strong feelings about a number of things I observed today:

    •        WHERE DO YOU GET OFF being so understanding and patient with us about needing to reschedule from our
             original date last month?
    •        NEVER IN MY LIFE do I have a second cup of coffee at home, but whatever you brewed today was far too
             irresistible to stop at one. Delish.
        •    WHERE THE HELL did the beautiful flower arrangements come from? Did I see some rhododendrons? Bob, that
             your doing?...
    •        HOW ON EARTH did you know that Perrier is Jake's water of choice?
    •        WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND would ever decline your invitation, and WHY didn't we do this sooner? It was
             terrific.
        •    Finally, I CAN NOT BELIEVE how you UNRELENTINGLY fired meaningful question after meaningful question at
             her, and the incredibly thoughtful conversation that ensued...

So, at the expense of speaking to you all far more bluntly and in gruffer language than you are accustomed to, I have
to tell you that she F*CKING loved today. LOVED.

And by that, I mean we're all so happy it happened, and so grateful for your hospitality. THANK YOU all so very much.

Philippe
