Hello Sung and Steve (from Beijing),
As I promised Sung, I would weigh in once I got back to Beijing. The visit to the DPRK by John Lewis, Bob Carlin and me
was a shocker. They took us to Yongbyon and showed us a functioning 2,000 centrifuge uranium enrichment plant in
operation and a small LWR under construction. The technical implications are significant and you understand the
political implications better than I do.
I am attaching a quick-look summary of my technical observations. Bob Carlin will follow with policy observations based
on our discussions with MFA officials and their implications as soon as he has a chance.
I am scheduled to be in DC for an advisory function for Secretary Steve Chu on Monday, Nov. 22. I will attempt to see
Secretary Clinton since my colleague, Bill Perry, had mentioned my trip to her during a recent West Coast swing. And, of

course, I very much would like to brief the two of you. At this point, I hope that Bob Carlin and I will be able to get
appointments either late on Monday, Nov. 22 or early on Tuesday, Nov. 23.
We are all returning to San Francisco on Sunday. I will try to contact Sung from here and then again when I return to my
Stanford office on Monday.
Thanks,
Sig
