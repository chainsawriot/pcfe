Not sure if she mentioned but Claire is out today and tomorrow on leave. Rob is in her seat.
Also, there's a group of young libyan, egyptian, and tunisian leaders who met with tara yesterday and wanted to get a
picture with you today. Very impressive group and mortified by the attacks. Hope its ok.
