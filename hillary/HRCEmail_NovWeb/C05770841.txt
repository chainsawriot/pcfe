There is a former diplomat on board as a private citizen. The israeli embassy told me a couple of minutes ago that some
Americans on board may have been injured during the incident. They are checking but wanted to give a heads up.

Looping in Dana Smith for sense of how this is playing in Middle East. There are protests in turkey                           B5


On another aspect, NPR reports a former US diplomat as part of the flotilla. We'll need to confirm and check his status.
