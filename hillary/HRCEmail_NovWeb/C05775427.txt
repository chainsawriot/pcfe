Talked to Karl, Richard and Jack.



Told PJ not to mention call today; he had already mentioned yesterday's call but won't say anything about today's. Karl
says there is a big-time leaker in the palace; this morning's tense meeting is already out in the press.

The team believes you should do this call now. They have no further info beyond what Richard told you. You will see
that there are two different paths depending on how the conversation goes. If it goes reasonably well, the first path is
basically a repeat of yesterday. If it goes badly, the team wants you to discuss what will have to happen this week. If it
stays bad, the team would like you to start raising more basic questions. You can see this from the progression of the
points, pasted below.
