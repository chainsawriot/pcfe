Subject: Mandela 'doing great' says daughter (AFP)


(AFP) Nelson Mandela is "doing great" and is enjoying time at home with his family after being discharged
from hospital, his daughter Zenani Mandela-Dlamini told AFP on Friday.

Mandela left hospital on Wednesday, after nearly three weeks of in-patient treatment for a recurrent lung
infection and surgery to have gallstones removed.

The 94-year-old is now convalescing at his Johannesburg home, where he received visits from friends, family
and a handful of well-wishers delivering flowers and other gifts.

"Madiba is doing great and he is enjoying his family," Mandela-Dlamini told AFP via text message.

Mandela-Dlamini is the eldest daughter of Nelson Mandela and Winnie Madikizela-Mandela.

She was due to begin an ambassadorship in Argentina this year, but her arrival was delayed by her father's
illness.
