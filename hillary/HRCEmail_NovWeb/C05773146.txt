About the Clinton Climate Initiative
The Clinton Climate Initiative (CCI) was launched in 2006 to create and implement solutions to the root causes of climate
change. In partnership with the C40 Climate Leadership Group (C40), CCI focuses on helping large cities, at their
invitation, reduce their carbon emissions. Other CCI programs aim to increase energy efficiency through building retrofits;
to increase access to clean energy technology and deploy it at the government, corporate, and homeowner levels; and to
reverse deforestation by working in line with national governments to preserve and regrow forests. Across all its
programs, CCI uses a holistic approach to address the major sources of greenhouse gas emissions and the people,
policies, and practices that impact them – while also saving money for individuals and governments, creating jobs, and
growing economies.

Clinton Administration Highlights

   •     Committed the U.S. to reducing its Carbon Footprint. In April 1993, President Clinton announced "our Nation's
         commitment to reducing our emission of greenhouse gases to their 1990 levels by 2000." While not all the goals
         were met, in large part because of population growth, U.S. CO2 emissions per capita decreased from 19.7 metric
         tons in 1990 to 16.9 metric tons in 2010.
   •     Laid out a vision that guided the creation of the Kyoto Protocol. In October 1997, President Clinton unveiled
         the U.S. position for the Kyoto negotiations: he embraced binding and realistic targets to reduce emissions to their
         1990 levels and a requirement that key developing nations meaningfully participate in efforts to reduce emissions.
         While the U.S. did not achieve all its negotiating objectives, and Congress failed to ratify the protocol, the final
         agreement, which was adopted eventually by 191 countries and the EU, included the emissions targets,
         timetables, and menu of market-based options the Clinton Administration's had originally proposed.
   •     Doubled Tax credits to Augment Efficiency and Expand the Use of Clean Energy Sources. Total U.S.
         energy tax expenditures, excise tax credits and grants in lieu of tax credits, designed to expand the private use of
         clean energy, rose from $1.4 billion in 1993 to $2.8 billion by 2001.
   •     Invested Over $2 Billion in R&D funding for the Climate Change Technology Initiative. In 1998, the Clinton
         Administration proposed a strategy, later funded at more than $2 billion, to spur R&D within the Federal
         government to develop renewable energy sources and more energy efficient technologies. The Initiative provided
         targeted tax credits to individuals and companies, and implemented voluntary information programs to educate
         businesses and schools.
   •     Strengthened Ozone Standards. In July 1997, the Clinton administration strengthened ozone standards by
         setting the first ever fine particle standard ("Particulate Matter 2.5") to prevent respiratory illness in children and
         millions of premature deaths among older Americans. Fine particle pollution is a byproduct of the combustion
         processes like the burning of high sulfur diesel fuel. After being challenged in court, the standards were
         eventually upheld by the Supreme Court 9-0 with Justice Scalia writing the majority opinion.
    •    Established substantial Limits on Gasoline Sulfur levels. In December 1999, President Clinton announced
          the promulgation of standards and the limits on gasoline sulfur levels. The new standards, called "Tier 2," marked
          the most significant mobile source initiative since the original passeriger car standards were established in the
         1970 Clean Air Act Amendments.
    •    Financed Foreign Efforts to Reduce Greenhouse Emissions. In 1993, the Clinton Administration established
          the U.S. Initiative on Joint Implementation which, over the course of the following eight years, engaged 26
          arrangements whereby U.S. firms agreed to finance projects in 11 other countries.
    •     Directed the government to lead by example by decreasing energy use in Federal building and facilities.
          President Clinton signed an executive order on Greening the Government. By 1999, the government had
          reduced its energy use in buildings by 20.5% compared to the 1985 baseline, saving $2.2 billion for American
          taxpayers.
    •     Ensured the North American Free Trade Agreement included provisions to protect the environment. In
          1993, President Clinton proposed and successfully appended supplemental agreements on the environment to
          NAFTA before it was ratified. At the time, it was unprecedented for environment-related provisions to be included
          in a trade agreement. By 2008, NAFTA's environmental provisions provided nearly $1 billion for 135
          environmental infrastructure projects along the U.S.-Mexico border, with a total estimated cost of $2.89 billion and
          allocated $33.5 million in assistance and $21.6 million in grants for over 450 other border environmental
          projects. The Mexican government also made substantial new investments in environmental protection,
           increasing the federal budget for the environmental sector by 81% between 2003 and 2008.

Clinton Foundation Highlights

Building on President Clinton's longstanding commitment to the environment, the Clinton Foundation has initiated
programs through the Clinton Climate Initiative (CCI) that create and advance solutions to the core issues driving climate
change — while also helping to reduce our reliance on oil, saving money for individuals and governments, creating jobs,
and growing economies. CCI, in partnership with C40 Climate Leadership Group, focuses on helping large cities reduce
their carbon emissions. Other programs aim to increase energy efficiency through building retrofits; to increase access to
clean energy technology and deploy it at the government, corporate, and homeowner levels; and to reverse deforestation
by preserving and regrowing forests.

    • More than 2 million tons of greenhouse gases prevented from release into the atmosphere through climate
       projects in cities and forests
    • More than 250 building energy efficiency projects in 47 cities that will prevent the release of more than 120,000
       tons of CO2 into the atmosphere per year
    • 30 waste management projects in development around the world, converting millions of tons of garbage to new
       enerav and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by more than 2 million tons annually

    •     10 forestry projects encompassing 644,000 hectares of land that will benefit 353,000 people in forest-dependent
          communities
    •     More than 4.5 million trees planted by more than 4,000 smallholder farmers through community reforestation
          projects in Malawi and Rwanda
    •     58 cities are now represented within the C40-CCI which account for eight percent of the global population, 14
          percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, and 20 percent of global GDP
    •     The Clinton Presidential Center is the first LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified
          building in Arkansas, and has been awarded two Green Globes by the Green Building Initiative for best practices
          in energy and environmental design

Clinton Global Initiative Highlights

    •     Better Buildings Challenge- The Obama Administration committed to the launch, leadership, and support of the
          Better Buildings Challenge. The Better Buildings Challenge is a White House-convened, DOE-supported
          leadership initiative that is co-led by President Bill Clinton and the President's Council on Jobs and
          Competitiveness. It directly engages business executives, state and local elected officials and leaders from other
          non-governmental organizations; recognizes the organizations they lead for making actionable commitments to
          improve energy efficiency in America's buildings;. and supports their efforts with technical assistance and policy
          support.
    •     Owner-Tenant Collaboration for Building Efficiency- The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC),
          together with its public sector partners — the New York City Mayor's Office of Long Term Planning and
          Sustainability (OLTPS) and the Washington, D.C. Downtown Business Improvement District (DCBID) — committed
          to help increase market demand for deep and cost-effective energy efficiency retrofits in the commercial office
          sector by engaging a group of major commercial property owners, tenants, and managers to collaborate with
          each other during lease negotiations.
    •     Investment and Training for American Infrastructure- At CGI America 2011, the American Federation of Labor
          and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) committed
          to work with pension fund managers to encourage infrastructure investments. They committed to work with fund
          managers to re-invest up to $10 billion in pension assets of working families into energy efficient, job-creating
          infrastructure improvements, and to train 140,000 apprentice and mid-career construction workers in high-
          demand green construction skills.
    •     Bioinnovation in Africa- People, Forests, Food, Energy- In 2011, Novozymes, in partnership with CleanStar
          Mozambique (CSM), committed to pioneering a food-energy system that will drastically improve both the
          environment and human lives. Farmers in Sofala province will be fully supported in implementing an
          environmentally restorative agroforestry system that will produce a wide range of crops. Farmers will be able to
          sell their excess production to CSM, thereby increasing their incomes by over 400%.
     •    Securing Wetland Carbon Stores for Climate- In 2011, Wetlands International committed to restoring and
           conserving more than one million hectares of wetlands and reducing CO2 emissions by at least 100 megatons by
          2015. To do so, Wetlands International will establish a global portfolio of long-term ecosystem restoration projects
           through which it will protect and rehabilitate wetlands (specially targeting peat swamp forests) for ecosystem,
           livelihood, biodiversity and carbon values.
