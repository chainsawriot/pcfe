Saudi Minister of Foreign Affairs Saud al Faysal wanted to pass the following message to the Secretary:

At 1800 Riyadh, the Saudis will announce that they are inviting the Iraqis to meet in Riyadh. They will invite the
president, the prime minister, and the heads of parties. The Saudis will provide the venue but will not interfere in the
discussion.

There is now no pending call request.
