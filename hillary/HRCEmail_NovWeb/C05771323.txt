Here it is â€”
                                                                          But what is most important
by far is for you really to engage and make it yours. It has, a lot of great stuff in it, but too much, a
reflection in part of the many great cooks we have in the kitchen. USAID sent over all the new
stuff for the development section. Bill Burns helped rewrite the diplomatic section, although I
think that still needs the most work. Jim and Jack both gave us overall comments. Jim in particular
emphasized the need, I think rightly, to demonstrate that as with the QDR, the QDDR is an
initiative designed to figure out what we need to stock up on today to have the right assets on hand
for what we foresee as the problems and crises of tomorrow. Hence the new top, but we can
certainly go back to the old one. I look forward to your reactions and your edits.
