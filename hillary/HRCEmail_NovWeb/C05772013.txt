Here are key topics from this morning's senior staff and regional bureaus meeting:

India

                                                                       We're getting closer to agreement.       B5

Iran

Still has not responded to P5+1 offer to meet mid-month. Sarah Shourd told press she will not go back to Iran
for trial (which Iranians told Swiss officially today had been postponed).

Iraq

                                                                                                                B5

Haiti

We're prepared to launch a task force to coordinate any response to impact of Tropical Storm/Hurricane
Tomas, expected to hit western edges of Haiti beginning tonight. PJ will do daily media briefs with OFDA as
long as it's required.

Yale/Peru

L and DOJ teams met separately with Yale officials to encourage return of antiquities to Peru; Yale officials
were not responsive. Garcia sent President a letter seeking his intervention while Peruvian courts prepare
indictments of senior Yale officials. We may ask S to call Yale President Levin.

Congress

Rich briefing staff on QDDR timing. Berman will do hearing on Iraq during week of 11/15; we have not yet
identified witness. Lugar wants us to stop Lugar-Kennedy youth exchange program under which 25% of Afghan
participants have been disappearing into the US or Canada as soon as they land in the US. We're pushing back
by noting the reforms we've instituted to minimize these cases.
