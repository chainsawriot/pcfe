I am so glad to see you in the swing of things and busy as ever. I am reminded that it has been a long time since we've
spoken. I would love to meet to catch up. I know how you are juggling the world so it doesn't need to happen soon - I'd
be happy to go to New York in a few months.

Let me know and I'm glad you're so well,

Neera
