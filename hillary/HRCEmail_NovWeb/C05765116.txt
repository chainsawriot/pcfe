Thanks—

Several questions:

   1.      How many career positions are there? The Foreign Service Act does not specify the number of Career
          Ambassadors. Since 1980, we have had between one and seven Career Ambassadors serving at a time. Right
          now, we have two active duty Career Ambassadors.
    2.    How many are currently career ambassadors now? We have two active duty Career Ambassadors — Bill Burns
          and Anne Patterson. Ryan Crocker and Richard Boucher have recently retired.
    3.    What is the purpose of the committee? The Board will review the performance files of the eligible candidates to
          determine if any qualify for the conferral of the rank of Career Ambassador.
   4.     Does the Secretary receive the names of all candidates who were considered? The Secretary will receive only
          the names of those who are recommended for Career Ambassador. You have the list of eligibles from the
          earlier email so it is not too hard to figure out who didn't make it.
    5.    What is the nature of the recommendation? The recommendation will include a written review of the Board's
          justification for its decision for each candidate.
    6.     Can you provide me with previous memos from 2007 in this regard? We have the files from the 2007 Board and
          will send you a copy for reference.
    7.     Are there other promotions besides to career ambassador that S is supposed to be considering and if so, is the
          process ad hoc like this one or is there a more systematic process? The conferral of the rank of Career
          Ambassador is the only promotion process that involves the Secretary directly.
    8.    Can you give me an update on where we are in the other processes (Ambassadors, DCMs, etc) and the
          anticipated timeline for meetings, etc. I've requested a meeting and can run through the schedule with
          you. We are currently soliciting expressions of interest, which will be completed on Friday. Anticipated meeting
          date for the D committee is mid-December.

    9. Can you advise if there are any other steps, meetings or actions S should be advised us so that she is a good
        partner in the process of supporting the progression and appointments of our career officials? Will do — there
        may be a number of things from our QDDR recommendations that will take her support and we will need to
        focus on getting ready for next year's D committee (ambassadorial assignments for 2011) after the first of the
        year.

Thanks so much.

Cheryl, let me know if you need more than this/have questions. Please note that the Bill rather than Pat is
chairing. Nancy

The board is scheduled to meet on November 13, 2009. U/S Burns(who is a Career Ambassador) is chairing. Other
members are U/S Kennedy, retired Career Ambassador Ruth Davis and retired Career Ambassador Marc
Grossman                                                                            The six Career Ministers who         B6
will be considered:

The Career Ambassador selection is not part of the regular Selection Board process. A CA board is set up on an as-
needed basis. The last Board met in 2007. With the retirement of four CA's in 2009, HR proposed a board for this year
to consider conferring the CA rank on the current eligible individuals. We now have two serving CA's, U/S Burns and
Ambassador Anne Patterson.
