Wade concedes defeat in Senegal.


(SBU) Embassy Dakar comments incumbent President Abdoulaye Wade conceded defeat at approximately 2145
Dakar/1745 EDT. Initial results indicate Sall won approximately 60 percent of the vote. Observation teams report Sail's
jubilant supporters have gathered in Dakar and other major cities. Embassy Dakar notes the Senegalese parliament
remains dominated by supporters of incumbent President Wade. Sall will have to work hard to forge consensus to push
forward his agenda once he takes office.
