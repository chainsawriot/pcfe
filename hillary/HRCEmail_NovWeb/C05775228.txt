I met with the German development minister yesterday




"International Tax Compact: Initiative to Strengthen International Cooperation with Developing Countries to Fight Tax
Evasion and Tax Avoidance"

Launched in August 2009 by the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), the International
Tax Compact is a multi-lateral effort to help developing countries and transition economies fighting tax evasion and
inappropriate tax practices, with the aim of achieving national and international development goals (list of participating
entities below). The ITC's work focuses on four primary areas:

1. Country / regional level: disseminate successful practices and reform experiences in policy formulation; legislation;
capacity development.

2. International cooperation: facilitate access to and exchange of information between policy makers, tax
administrators, civil society and private sector;

3. Analytical work: perform analytical work on development-specific topics to make available international discussions
on tax reform;

4. Networking and dialogue: foster networking on taxation and development between ITC members and vis-Ã -vis other
initiatives.
