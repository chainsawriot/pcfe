A reporter named Kerry Elleveld of The Advocate is doing a possible cover story on your LBGT efforts at State. Caroline
has put her through the ringer of Cheryl, GLIFFA leaders and members, gay ambassadors, Pat Kennedy, etc etc. Would
love to put you on the phone with her in the next day or two. Should be super positive.
