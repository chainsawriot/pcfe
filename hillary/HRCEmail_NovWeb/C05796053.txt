Subject: Taliban publicly execute woman near Kabul -officials (Reuters)

KABUL (Reuters) - A man Afghan officials say is a member of the Taliban shot dead a woman accused of
adultery in front of a crowd near Kabul, a video obtained by Reuters showed, a sign that the austere Islamist
group dictates law even near the Afghan capital.

   In the three-minute video, a turban-clad man approaches a woman kneeling in the dirt and shoots her five
times at close range with an automatic rifle, to cheers of jubilation from the 150 or so men watching in a village
in Parwan province.

   "Allah warns us not to get close to adultery because it's the wrong way," another man says as the shooter gets
closer to the woman. "It is the order of Allah that she be executed".

  Provincial. Governor Basir Salangi said the video, obtained July 7, was shot a week ago in the village of
Qimchok in Shinwari district, about an hour's drive from Kabul.

   Such rare public punishment was a painful reminder to Afghan authorities of the Taliban's 1996-2001 period
in power, and it raised concern about the treatment of Afghan women 11 years into the NATO-led war against
Taliban insurgents.

  "When I saw this video, I closed my eyes ... The woman was not guilty; the Taliban are guilty," Salangi told
Reuters.

   When the unnamed woman, most of her body tightly wrapped in a shawl, fell sideways after being shot
several times in the head, the spectators chanted: "Long live the Afghan mujahideen! (Islamist fighters)", a
name the Taliban use for themselves.

   The Taliban could not be reached for comment.

   Despite the presence of over 130,000 foreign troops and 300,000 Afghan soldiers and police, the Taliban
have managed to resurge beyond their traditional bastions of the south and east, extending their reach into once
more peaceful areas like Parwan.
