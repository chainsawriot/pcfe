Huma, sorry you'll miss Tokyo. Hope you're well. On dinner, sounds great.
Yes, I have a nice relaxed Japanese restaurant I think she'll enjoy.

Hi Ambassador - your team has been great to work with to put together S visit tomorrow. I'm unfortunately missing this
stop but I was talking to the Secretary yesterday and she was hoping to have dinner with you tomorrow night. How does
that sound? Maybe you have a favorite place she would like?
