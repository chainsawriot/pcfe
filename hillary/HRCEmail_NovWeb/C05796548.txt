         Israei press is reporting that Bibi pressured Jewish leaders not to meet with Abbas so they
         canceled the meeting. (See article below.) Just so that you know, a few of them did drop out, but
         the meeting is still happening with a good roster of Jewish leaders, but we're keeping it quiet so
         that it can proceed. (Please keep that between you and David for now, we dont want it getting
         blown up even further.)


           MEETING ABU MAZEN

           PRIME MINISTER'S BUREAU PRESSURED AND US JEWS CANCELLED MEETING WITH ABU MAZEN

         Ma'ariv (p. 3) by Eli Bardenstein Following heavy pressure by the Prime Minister's Bureau on
        senior Jewish figures in the US, the latter cancelled their scheduled meeting with PA Chairman
        Abu Mazen. Sources in the US and Israel confirmed the details.

    A number of prominent people in the Jewish community in the US were scheduled to hold a
  meeting today with Abu Mazen, who came to New York for the UN General Assembly. Abu
  Mazen was invited by the meeting's patron, Jewish media mogul Mort Zuckerman, who is one
  of the richest people in the US and considered to be a close friend of the prime minister. Other
  people who were invited were Malcolm Hoenlein, Executive VP of the Conference of
  Presidents, and National Director of the Anti-Defamation League Abe Foxman. However, the
  Prime Minister's Bureau's learned of the meeting and told Zuckerman that was wrong for the
  Jewish community to meet the Palestinian Authority chairman, when he systematically refused
  to meet with the Israeli leader. As a result, the meeting was cancelled. A Jewish figure in New
  York said that" due to Abu Mazen's behavior and his refusal to meet with the prime minister,
  this was the obvious conclusion".

   The Prime Minister's Bureau refused to comment.
