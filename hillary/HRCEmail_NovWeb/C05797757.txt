I had to share this with you all. Claudia is one of the longest serving Ambassadors nowâ€”so she has experienced quite a
bit and, therefore, very hard to impress. The success of the trip is in large measure due to the very hard work and
extraordinary planning of Ali Rubin. She collaborated so well with the Arkansas team lead by Stephanie S.
It was really just wonderful!!

Madame Ambassador, dear Capricia,

Having returned from another unforgettable trip within the Experience America program, I would like to thank you and the
17 protocol officers who accompanied us on the trip to Arkansas wholeheartedly for a truly special experience.

I said to Larry Luxner that the trip should be headlined "Experience the Unexpected".

         I so much appreciated our group being hosted at the Clinton Presidential Center.
         I loved to see the beautiful countryside on our bus trip from Little Rock to Fayetteville.
         I may have been the only member of our group to see The March of the Ducks at the Peabody Hotel across the
         Street from our hotel in Little Rock.
         I was deeply impressed by the number of Fortune 100 companies that have a significant presence in Arkansas.
         I have found my new favorite painting at the breathtakingly beautiful Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art:
         Rosie the Riveter by Norman Rockwell.
         I will never forget meeting two of the Little Rock Nine.

You all did such a wonderful job in organizing the trip meticulously, paying attention to every small detail, enable us to
have encounters that we ourselves would not even have thought of and, most of all, you were patient, gracious and
untiring in making this a unique trip for all of us.

Thank you so very much!

Warmly,
Claudia

Claudia Fritsche
