                                               Haiti Cholera Situation Report
                                                     November 22, 2010
                                   The following information is for internal USG use only.

Topline Issues

• Cholera Case Numbers: As of November 17, the Government of Haiti (GoH) Ministry of Health (MoH)
  reported 47,478 cholera cases and 1,161 deaths.
• Supplies:  On November 20, USAID's Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA) facilitated
  delivery of 8 million aquatabs to Port-au-Prince. USAID's Disaster Assistance Response Team
  (USAID/DART) will consign the aquatabs to the GoH water and sanitation agency (DINEPA). With nearly
  100 million aquatabs now in the pipeline, DIN EPA is prepared to significantly scale-up distribution to
  affected and at-risk areas. The aquatabs can treat the water of more than 950,000 households for one
  month, at a distribution rate of 105 tablets per household.
• Cholera Kit Pre-Positioning: USAID/Haiti health staff and the USAID/DART received approval from MoH on
  November 19 to pre-position cholera kits in critical sites throughout each department in Haiti. The kits
  contain Ringer's Lactate, antibiotics, and personal protective equipment for health staff. In total, the kits
  will treat 10,000 people with moderate-to-severe cholera.
• Caseload   Projections: Epidemiologists from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) agreed to work
  with staff of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) on developing new, more reliable cholera caseload
  projections, in order to better inform preparedness activities over the next 12 months.

Status Updates

Cholera Care and Treatment
• Cholera Treatment Facilities: Thirty-six cholera treatment centers (CTCs) and 61 cholera treatment units
   (CTUs) were operational in Haiti as of November 19. In metropolitan Port-au-Prince, 11 of 14 planned
   CTCs have been constructed with a capacity of approximately 1,000 beds. The Health Cluster is
   coordinating with partners to develop surge capacity to operate additional CTCs, in order to meet the
   target of 2,000 cholera beds in Port-au-Prince.
• CTU Placement: USAID/OFDA grantee the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and its partners
   have assessed 92 proposed CTU sites in Port-au-Prince. Teams identified 35 of the 92 sites as suitable for
   CTU placement. CTUs were operational in an additional 16 assessed sites.
• Artibonite Department and Areas North: USAID/OFDA grantee International Medical Corps (IMC) is
   responding to cholera in the north through an integrated approach, which includes hygiene promotion
   messaging through community leaders and the deployment of mobile health units to remote areas. One
   doctor and one nurse accompany each unit to deliver supplies to rural dispensaries, train health workers,
   and treat people when necessary.
• Cap-Haitien Unrest: From November 15 to 19, protests in Cap-Haitien impeded the cholera
   response. Oxfam suspended water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) programming, PAHO suspended
   trainings, and the Logistics Cluster suspended commodity transportation postponed distributions
   scheduled for this week. On November 19, relative calm was reported, as people began to clear roads and •
   open businesses. The USAID/DART will continue to monitor the situation.
• Northeast Department: New cases continue to emerge in Quanaminthe and Fort Liberte. In response,
   PAHO dispatched four tons of medical supplies to support the local MoH unit.
• West Department and the Southern Claw: IMC is assessing cholera treatment and preparedness needs in
   southern Haiti, with particular emphasis on remote areas. IMC currently operates five clinics in Port-au-
    Prince settlements, seven clinics in Petit Goave sites, West Department, and two in Jacmel, Southeast
    Department. As part of its augmented response, IMC may deploy mobile medical units in the south, as in
   the north, and establish four CTUs with a capacity of 10 to 20 beds each in Petit Goave, West Department,
    where Medicins du Monde operates the hospital and CTC. IMC also signed a memorandum of
    understanding with the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) to enable IMC to serve as first responder to
    emergencies in the area.

Cholera Preparedness and Surveillance
• Water Treatment: As of November 19, DINEPA and WASH cluster teams reported below-standard
   chlorine residual in 42 percent of 284 assessed water bladders and reservoirs in Port-au-Prince. Results so
   far vary significantly by commune, with Carrefour households and Petionville bladders containing the
   lowest levels of residual. Teams also continue to analyze water sources in 22 percent of internally
   displaced person settlements. These sites currently lack WASH programs.
• Messaging: In Les Cayes, Grand Anse Department, the International Federation of Red Cross Societies
   (IFRC) began planning cholera-awareness campaigns, with an initial target of 220 schools.
• After sending SMS messages on basic cholera prevention to more than 2 million people in Artibonite
   Department and Port-au-Prince, more than 75,000 recipients called a free IFRC information line to receive
   more detailed information. The figure likely underestimates the population's responsiveness to the
   messaging, as the number of calls quickly exceeded the capacity of the information line.

Logistics and Medical Relief Commodities
• PROMESS Warehouse: On November 19, the USAID/DART leader and public health advisor and
   USAID/Haiti health staff met with PAHO and PROMESS representatives to discuss supply chain and
   distribution issues for incoming and in-country medical commodities. USAID staff assured PROMESS of the
   international community's commitment to assist in strengthening the system and streamlining processes,
   in order to maximize supply distributions and improve the overall cholera response.
• PROMESS is consolidating information on in-country and pipeline supplies, including commodities
   provided by USAID/Haiti and USAID/OFDA. In addition, PROMESS has begun to utilize the Logistics Cluster
   to pre-position supplies in four primary departmental warehouses, in order to begin decentralizing the
   PROMESS system.
• Logistics Cluster Activities: On November 19, the Logistics Cluster transported 67,000 Ringer's Lactate
   infusions, as well as ORS, health promotion materials, and technical guidelines, on behalf of PAHO to 13
   locations across the country. In total, the cluster delivered 40 tons of supplies on the first day of a three-
   day operation to support the MoH strategy of delivering essential medicines and supplies to heavily
   affected areas and to pre-position supplies in remote areas.
• The cluster transported two mobile storage units (MSUs) from Port-au-Prince to Saint-Marc for use by
   Health and WASH cluster members. The cluster also erected two MSUs in Cap-Haitien, as well as four in
   Port-au-Prince at the PROMESS warehouse, in order to increase reception capacity for incoming air
   cargo. The U.N. shipped 12 additional MSUs to Port-au-Prince from Panama. U.N. Stabilization Mission in
   Haiti (MINUSTAH) engineers are assisting in preparing sites across the country for MSU
   installation. MINUSTAH is also storing PAHO medical supplies in MINUSTAH compounds in Jeremie, Grand
   Anse Department; Miragoane, Nippes Department; and Hinche and Mirebalais, Center Department.

Dominican Republic
• Caseload Update: The Government of the Dominican Republic (GoDR) MoH reported four confirmed case
  of cholera as of November 21. Three people with confirmed cholera reportedly did not travel to Haiti. To
  date, MoH has investigated 34 suspected cases, and of the 28 cases sent for testing, 18 were negative for
  cholera, 4 tested positive, 2 tested positive only in rapid testing but not culture testing, and 4 are pending
   results.
• Border and Market Status: Border markets were open on November 19. However, due to reports of
  cholera cases in Quanaminthe in eastern Haiti, DR authorities in Dajabon began following strict
   precautions when processing people entering the DR from Haiti. Allowing twice-weekly market days may
  challenge cholera prevention efforts, should the number of cases in Quanaminthe continue to increase.

•     USG Response: Two CDC staff members in the DR continue to support MoH activities, which include
      mobilizing community-level prevention and case-finding measures in all eight administrative units of Santo
      Domingo. USAID is advising MoH to develop a WASH operational plan, prioritize supplies needed to
      support the government response, and develop a distribution plan for those supplies.
