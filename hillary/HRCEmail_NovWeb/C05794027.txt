Dear Hank,


When I switched blackberries last week, I lost a bunch of emails, including yours. But, as I recall, you asked if Iwould be a
reference for you                                   Of course, I would be delighted. So, pls send me whatever info I may
need to draft a letter extolling your many virtues.

I'm copying Rob Russo, my assistant who works on matter like this for me so you will have two email addresses, in case
mine goes kaput again.


Stay safe in Afghanistan--all the best, H
