Subject:                           Les Gelb on the Obama response


The whole thing is worth a read, but a very tough judge gives you and the President credit:

By any standard of reason, President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton conducted themselves very well amid the
confusion and crises. Of course they didn't do everything perfectly; for example, some unidentified administration official
disowned the embassy statement condemning the video. Such creepiness served only to make it look like Obama was
running for cover at the expense of our embattled diplomats. But minor miscues aside, Obama and Clinton nailed the
main points, especially Clinton. In her first statement soon after the riots, here's what she said: "The United States
deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back
to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear: There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind."
