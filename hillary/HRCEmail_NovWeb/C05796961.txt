Dear Bill,

As this time of festivity and celebration, Jeannette and I wanted to extend our very best wishes for a happy and
prosperous new year.

We also would like to take the opportunity to wish Madame Hillary a swift and full recovery - our thoughts are
with you both.

I look forward to the next occasion we shall have to meet, or otherwise interact - it always is a pleasure
discussing issues of shared interest. Until then, success in all your endeavours!

Sincerely,

Paul
