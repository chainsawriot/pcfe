Subject:                      H: Thanks! Sid



H: Well, Thanksgiving, indeed! Congrats on the ceasefire. Hope it holds. "It is what it is." Bibi refuses
a partner for peace, but has encouraged one for war. The logic, in the particular syllogism of the
region: the enemy of my enemy (Abbas) is also my enemy but also my friend. Will make a good
chapter in "Six (Seven, Eight...) Crises." So, happy Thanksgiving. Sid
