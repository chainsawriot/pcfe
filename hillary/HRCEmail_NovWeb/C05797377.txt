Hi there--
I'd imagine that you would have appreciated a more festive and comfortable setting in which to ring in the new
year--I'm sorry that you spent it where you did, though glad to hear                 that you're progressing
well. For me, contemplating how you might celebrate the passage of a year is challenging--your life has been
filled with so many momentous ones, and to reflect on any one of them must feel like drinking from a fire
hydrant. I hope that, particularly as you look back on these last four years, you feel a sense of peace,
satisfaction, and, yes, awe-- in a life filled with spectacular years, you have added some standouts to the
collection. I also hope that the year ahead provides both rest and relaxation as well as renewal and discovery.




Happy new year,
Dan
