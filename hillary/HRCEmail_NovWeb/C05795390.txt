Melanne,

It was a nice surprise running into you in Morocco and being able to spend a few minutes together. As I
mentioned, the Moroccans, at the highest level, deeply appreciate Secretary Clinton's/Hillary's attention to
Morocco these past four years. I can tell you that King Mohammed and his counselors are extremely excited
about the coming launch of the Strategic Dialogue. The King views next week's event as a crowning
achievement of the past thirteen years of his effort to create a strategic relationship with the US on bilateral,
regional and multilateral matters.

As I mentioned last night, there are two concerns that I hope you can bring up to the Secretary. The first
concerns her remarks at the event next week, and the second is in regards to the final communique that
comes out following the event itself.

From the point of view of the officials at the highest levels in Morocco, this new Strategic Dialogue is the
logical next step in a long history of our relations, especially over the last dozen years under the King's
leadership, which have included a Free Trade Agreement, major non-NATO ally status, an MCC compact, and
positive public statements that the Secretary/Hillary has made about the real progress that the King has made
in Morocco on political, social and economic reforms.

 It is "our" hope that Secretary Clinton/Hillary will draw particular attention to this fact, when she makes her
 public comments in at the SD next week, and says what this Dialogue represents and how it has come to pass
 as the culmination of the many things that Morocco has accomplished over the past 15 years and three US
 Administrations. This really is a story about the leadership of the King, including his recent interventions with
 the Secretary, and it is something I'm sure he would be pleased to hear. As I mentioned, there are many
 detractors and political adversaries in Morocco that are critical of the King and state that the US-Morocco
 relationship has waned, due to the fact that he has not yet met with President Obama. The SD obviously

refutes this claim, and the Secretary's words in support of the King's achievements will go a long way in
carefully balancing comments and correcting misinterpretations.

The Moroccans have also been working diligently on a draft final communique to be issued jointly at the end
of the SD meeting, as well as a set of issues for the working groups, including women's empowerment. I am
afraid the communique will get watered down without Hillary's staff's direct intervention to represent her
views. I would graciously ask that you pass both messages on, and assure you that the views I express herein
come from the highest levels in Morocco.

On a personal note, I would like to reiterate how proud I am to have been associated with Hillary and her team
these past years. Her success makes us proud.
Talk with you soon and good luck next week with the SD,
Ed
