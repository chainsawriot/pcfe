Subject: checking a quote from you for a piece I have coming out in The Atlantic

You have had quite a few days! But bravo on pulling it out. I truly wished I could have been with you on the ground. This
is no time to be sending you extra reading, but I have written a piece on women, work-family balance, and how far our
society still needs to go for The Atlantic (it is slated to be the cover story for the July-August issue). I think you will like it
and will certainly enjoy reading it, as it naturally deals a great deal with my time in DC. I'll send it within the next week.
But I want to make sure you are comfortable with the one place that I quote you directly:

"Ten years later, whenever I am introduced at a lecture or a speech, I insist that the person introducing me mention that
I have two sons. It seems odd to me to list degrees, awards, positions, and interests and not include the dimension of my
life that is most important to me—and that takes an enormous amount of my time. As Secretary Clinton once said in a
television interview in Beijing when the interviewer asked her about Chelsea's upcoming wedding: 'That's my real life."

I am certain that is what you said, because it struck me so forcefully, but there is no public record. So pse let me know
via Huma or Cheryl.
Best,
AM
