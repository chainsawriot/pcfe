  Reflective Hillary Clinton urges South Africa to live
  up to Mandela's legacy
  By Anne Gearan, Wednesday, August 8, 11:19 AM

  CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- In an unusually personal reflection on forgiveness and redemption, Secretary of
  State Hillary Rodham Clinton urged South African students too young to remember apartheid not to lose sight
  of the example their country holds for the world and themselves.

  Nearing the end of her term as America's top diplomat, Clinton wrapped a message about statesmanship in
  unscripted references to her own unique transformation from a pilloried first lady and failed presidential
  candidate.

  "I've been in and around politics a long time," said Clinton, who is on an eight-nation African trip. "It's easy
  to lose sight of the common humanity of those who oppose you. You get to feeling that your way is the right
  way, and that your agenda is the only one" worth pursuing.

It becomes all too easy, Clinton said with a self-mocking tone and a crooked smile, to "dehumanize" anyone
who disagrees with you.

Speaking to students and staff at the University of the Western Cape midway through an 11-day African trip,
Clinton sounded more like a memoirist than a diplomat. As secretary of state, Clinton wields celebrity born of
her eight years as first lady. But public mentions of her life before she entered politics are rare, and usually
brief.

Clinton challenged the audience to live up to South Africa's position as a top power in the region and to the
legacy of political prisoner turned president Nelson Mandela.

To make good on Mandela's example, South Africa must take on greater responsibility and shed some of its
suspicion of western ideas, she said.

Distrust of the United States is strong here, as shown by a student protest outside the lecture hall. From behind
police barricades, the demonstrators shouted and held up signs reading, "End Israeli and US Murder," and
"U.S. Stop Killing People In Middle East."

Inside, however, Clinton appeared to charm an audience that included 18- and 19- year olds who weren't born
when Mandela walked out of Robben Island prison in 1990, and who were infants or toddlers when the black
activist became president of a democratic South Africa in 1994.

Clinton attended Mandela's inauguration when she was first lady. She came amid a blur of scandals and
investigations, including Whitewater, the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit, the failed "Blackhawk
Down" raid in Somalia and opposition to a national health care proposal crafted by a task force that she led.

The Clintons' friend and deputy White House counsel Vince Foster had committed suicide the year before,
after writing bitterly about a culture of political bloodlust in Washington.

"When I came to that inauguration, in 1994, it was a time of great political conflict in my own country. My
husband was president. People were saying terrible things about us both," Clinton said.

The attacks were both personal and political, and they made her angry, Clinton said. "I was beginning to think,
`who do they think they are?' Clinton said to laughter.

Mandela's gracious invitation to three of his former white jailers to join the dignitaries at his inaugural lunch
was a lesson in overcoming resentment and injustice, Clinton said.

Clinton flew to a small village Monday to visit the ailing, homebound 94-year-old Mandela. He remains a
national icon in South Africa.

"You are called to build on that legacy to ensure that your country fulfills its own promise and takes its place
as a leader among nations," Clinton said.

Clinton alluded to tension between the United States and South Africa over such issues as intervention in
Libya and U.N. sanctions on Syria, on which South Africa abstained rather than appearing to side with western
nations. South Africa's foreign minister, standing with Clinton at a press conference Tuesday, said the
country's position, "yesterday, today and tomorrow" is that it will not interfere in another nation's internal
affairs.

"You are a democratic power with the opportunity to influence Africa and the world," Clinton said, urging
South Africa to lower trade barriers and stimulate the economies of its neighbors while expanding its
international reach.

South Africa can be influential in resolving the standoff with Iran over its nuclear program, Clinton said. The
United States and much of the world suspect the program is aimed at building a bomb.

"As the first country to voluntarily give up nuclear weapons, South Africa speaks with rare authority," Clinton
said. "You can most convincingly make the case that giving up nuclear weapons is a sign of strength, not
weakness."
