Subject: Upcoming travel

Just wanted to let you know I will be seeing my friends again Sunday and Monday in Prague. I will leave Saturday
afternoon to get there and then will take part with my London friend in a separate track two exercise flying back on
Wednesday. I am here through the end of the week, doing a talk at the Department on Thursday. I don't know if you
want to get together before I go. After I return next week, I am back only on Thursday the 2nd and then go off to Aspen
Friday morning.

I have a fuller brief from my London friend about his meetings with his main friend who he described as being the most
receptive he has ever been. He described him as being open and not skeptical. He feels you had an impact on him,
making this more real. My friend also felt that we have a narrow window and we need to move this now as quickly as
we can. I told him that he needs to start off our meeting with a brief of his discussion, and its implications.

I also think if there is a window, it may not remain open long given the vulnerability of my London friend's friend. Those
who feel vulnerable don't do smart things and I can easily see him going down a self-defeating track.
