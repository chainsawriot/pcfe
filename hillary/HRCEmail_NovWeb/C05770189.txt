                    lad good meetings with UN and SG last week.                                                           1.4(B)

                                                                                                                          B1
                                                         ensuring Uribe has a veto on all procedural and substantive
 matters and that this is not a separate investigation but a panel to "receive and review" the two national reports and
 make recs on how to avoid such incidents in future.


F7rnade his points strongly to          re: panel "of inquiry" and "affected states" but these remain and will not be
 removed.
                   I sens        realizes this is the best text they can get and these points are not core.




                                                                                                           The ball is
 now in Israel's court.       as asked Israel for an answer tomorrow. The Seven ministers are meeting at 10am local to
 decide.




 Tomorrow we should know where we are. Indeed, we could have the panel's establishment announced by Ban !
 tomorrow, if no curve-balls.

 Best,

 Susan

I am meeting with        oday at his request. My understanding is he wants to discuss the proposed UN Panel on the
Gaza flotilla. We have continued to work closely with                   as they negotiate with the UN on the terms of
reference and method of work (Brooke will send the latest draft texts separately).

                                                                           the biggest being the name of the panel
(whether it is called "panel of inquiry" or the word "inquiry" is dropped as       insists).




Will continue to keep you posted.

Best,

Susan
