Subject: Fw: Ethnics and ASSK

Team: Following ASSK's off schedule discussions last night in NYC with ethnic minority leaders (see below), she asked to
sit down with me for an hour chat this morning before we departed for Kentucky:

--She asked if S can inquire of Thein Sein why he won't include ASSK in the peace process. She has offered to help (and
the ethnics want her participation), but despite polite responses from peace negotiators, she has word from presidential
channels that IS doesn't want her involved - especially in Kachin and Rakhine.

                                                                                                                            1.4(D)
                                                                                                                            B1   1
                                          The ethnics report renewed BA fighting against the cease-fire Shan (note:
something Shan democrat Hkun Htun Oo also told us last week) - another sign the GOB is not serious about an equal
playing field approach to permanent peace settlements.

--As a result of these challenges on ethnic issues, uncertain relations with the military, and clear tensions between the
executive and the USDP-dominated parliament, the upcoming USDP party convention could demand leadership changes
with surprising results.

Note:                                                                               she appears pleased that IS now 1.4(D)
wants to see her in NYC this week (and wants to accommodate, though not to the point of upending her tight schedule) B1
and acknowledges she wouldn't be free to move about the cabin without his bold reform steps.

ASSK met privately last night (9/22) in NYC with a delegation of ethnic leaders visiting from Burma and the Thai border -
the NCUB plus others. Karen leader Saw David Tharckabaw - VP of the KNU - seems to have served as a spokesman of
sorts. Highlights of ethnic concerns:

--The SPDC established "easy" cease-fires then tried to isolate and crush the KNU. Now the new GOB has isolated the
KNU and is trying to crush the Kachin. This won't work, though - there are no longer enough fanatic Burmans to join the
fight.


                                                                                                                          1.4(D)
                                                                                                                          B1

--The reform and peace charm offensive is designed simply to get the West to lift sanctions. With Thein Sein playing
"good cop," the GOB is perpetuating old regime divide and conquer tactics - e.g. separate peace talks.


--The ethnics want development, but need majority rights for natural resources.


--Want the US/EU/Japan to encourage the GOB to hold trilateral talks with the UNFC-United Nationalities Federal
Council ("the most viable ethnic nationality alliance"), the GOB, and ASSK/democratic forces.


--The EU and others (esp Norwegians) are supporting GOB peace efforts by relaying on "data propaganda" of the
GOB/SPDC, such as incorrect census information.


Comment: It appears these ethnic leaders had nothing positive to say about reform. I'll send separately a few
observations from ASSK on all this.
