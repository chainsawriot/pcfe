Ambassador Zhang came in to see us today on a range of issues
cooperative projects. We are exploring some options on Iran language -- working closely with Wendy and her team.




Also conveyed all messages to Phils. They are pleased and I think a little relieved. These are quite positive developments
which we can build on. Kurt
