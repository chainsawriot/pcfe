Thankfully, I am racing to the finish line and on the mend. Would enjoy seeing you once the dust settles to catch up so
please contact me (at this email) next month.

All the best, H

I am so glad to see you in the swing of things and busy as ever. I am reminded that it has been a long time since we've
spoken. I would love to meet to catch up. I know how you are juggling the world so it doesn't need to happen soon - I'd
be happy to go to New York in a few months.

Let me know and I'm glad you're so well,

Neera
