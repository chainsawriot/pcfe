Dear Mr. President and Madam Secretary:



First of all, Sheri and I very much enjoyed our time together in East Hampton. We would love to spend time
with you again if the opportunity arises.



I wanted to follow up on a couple of items we discussed.



First, let me respond to you on the question of the recent health care legislation and its impact on Starbucks.



As I mentioned to you, Starbucks has been providing health insurance as an option to our full and part time
employees since 1992. We made a decision to extend the health care option to any partner (we call our
employees partners) who works 20 hours a week at that time and it has been a core benefit and an example of
the kind of values we embody. We anticipate that the Affordable Care Act will increase benefits costs to
Starbucks because the individual mandate will cause many partners who currently waive our coverage to join
our benefit plan. Eligibility for other coverage, including Medicaid, could mitigate the additional cost, but we
anticipate that the initial impact will be an additional cost to Starbucks. There is some irony to this as the ACA
mandates plan coverage to employees who work 30 hours a week. We could change our eligibility to map to

the new law, but that is not something we want to sacrifice. Our legacy of health coverage for part-time
partners is deeply rooted in our mission, and aligned with our commitment to the Partner experience and the
customer experience. Offering affordable health insurance to all partners who work an average of 20 hours a
week will continue at Starbucks and will remain an important part of our culture.



Approximately 92,000 partners are eligible for benefits and historically some portion have waived
coverage. With the mandate extension this will change the equation for us and add to our cost basis. Further,
in the initial years of the Affordable Care Act implementation, we believe that partners will prefer the Starbucks
plans to Medicaid due to lack of understanding of the Medicaid coverage and/or due to a negative stigma
associated with Medicaid. The Starbucks coverage will comply with the Act precluding partners from getting
any federal subsidy to purchase coverage on an exchange. Given this, we expect that the number of partners on
the Starbucks plan will increaseâ€”also increasing costs to us. We were supportive of the ACA and would
oppose its repeal. At the same time, it is far from perfect and will result in greater expense to us....a somewhat
counterintuitive result, given that we have tried to do the right thing for all these years.



As to the other matter you asked for information about, I'm passing along a memo from Mark Pinsky, President
and CEO of the Opportunity Finance Network that outlines the evidence that there is an unmet demand for
small business financing.



Good luck on the convention speech tonight. The picture you collectively painted for our future as a nation
will no doubt be reflected in the speech this evening and contribute greatly to this re-election effort. The
country is blessed to have both of you continue to give so much. And Sheri and I loved every minute of your
company.



Until our paths cross again, our very best to you both.



Warm regards,



Sheri and Howard
