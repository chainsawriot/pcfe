MS -

Rather than rely on the Google to see how Ohio looked at this same point in '04, I went to a far more reliable resource: I
asked Andrew. Of course, he'd already looked into it yesterday. Below is his take.

Andrew, can you please also lay out why you and I are so confident overall in our belief that the President will win re-
election, how the map has always been and remains too tough for Romney to overcome.

Funny you should ask. Nate Cohn of the New Republic's Electionate blog just posted on this yesterday and I read so you
don't have to. See post and chart below. Bottom line, until about Oct 25, Kerry was up about 1-3. Then right around
now, the polls uniformly shifted to Bush (except for Gallup). Election day was Nov. 2 in 2004, its November 6 this
year. So polling this week will start to tell us if there is the same shift. BTW - the field date for the University of
Cincinnati poll that shoes a tie end on Oct. 23 and the CNN poll showing Obama up by 4 in Ohio ended October 25 so
don't think you can use that tied poll it as evidence of a shift. As Nate Silver pointed out, if Obama is up by two in Ohio,
some polls will show him up four and some will show ties or even him down one.

2004 And The Possibility Of A Shift In Ohio With just ten days to go, it's an open question whether Mitt Romney can
make a comeback in Ohio. As Nate Silver noted today, the polls are getting accurate at this late stage, and the odds
strongly favor Obama maintaining a lead in Ohio polls heading into Election Day . That might be especially true this y ear,
since the polls have been remarkably consistent, Obama has already banked a lead among early voters, and it's hard to
imagine advertisements making a late difference after months of airing beyond saturation levels. If Obama still leads by
2 or 3 points in Ohio in ten day s, the risk of a Romney victory would hinge on the possibility of a sy stemic error in the
polls. It happens, but not especially often.
Still, while the odds are against a late Romney turnaround, it's not impossible. It's worth recalling the Ohio polls from
this time in 2004, which showed Kerry tied or slightly ahead. Starting with the polls conducted over these very dates
eight y ears ago, Bush took a slight and consistent lead in Ohio and never relented. From this point onward, Kerry only
led in one poll of Ohio (Gallup, of course)
