Subject:                          Response regarding visa case



Madam Secretary:

Roberta Jacobson called. Regarding the visa case, the reasons for the original denial still stand. The applicant has a
permanent ineligibility and would need a waiver to get another visa. Post does not believe a waiver is merited at this
time.

Maria
