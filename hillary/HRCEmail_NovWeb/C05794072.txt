       Cheryl:



       I have been working with Liz Bagley and the Foreign Affairs Museum Council on their project.
       Liz has done a sensational job raising funds and we are in need of one more major effort to
       secure the first stage funding. That depends heavily now on getting a suitable reception/meeting
       built around Secretary Clinton. I can only imagine the requests for her time and the pressing
       travel and other commitments. The world gets no easier. I would be most grateful if there is
       anything you can do with her to try to nail this down around the time frame suggested by Liz
       which I think is over the next couple of months.



       Please use my interest in this if it matters to Secretary Clinton or anyone else and know that I am
       as always very grateful for your help.



       Also please thank the Secretary for her very helpful and informative letter on involving women
       more effectively in the search for Arab-Israeli peace. I am most grateful to hear about all that she
       and Milan and the rest of your are doing.



       Sincerely,
