PLEASE FORWARD TO HILARY CLINTON

Dear Hillary,


This is a letter of admiration, love and appreciation.

Please take care of yourself.


You have been an extraordinary Secretary of State, but the sort of travel you've been doing is very difficult--even on a jet
provided by our government.


I worry about your exhaustion, your health. You are an extraordinary woman and we all need you. So take care of
yourself.


Some of us are not so good at self-care--especially those of us who want to change the world and make it a better place.
You have already done so—with great skill and passion. We need you to carry on in the best of health.

Please remember all the women and men who admire you and count on your humor, your brilliance and your tenacity.


Be very kind and caring to yourself—for yourself and for all of us. You are much appreciated and loved.

Best wishes,


ERICA JONG
