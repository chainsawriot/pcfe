Lissa is right -



I've not seen what they've done in the last 36 hours - they've just been cranking away.

As for the piece, I thought it was in decent shape as of midnight last night, with a few things still needing to be added
and refined, but certainly something you could work with. But this morning AMS has re- jiggered the whole beginning
and, frankly, I'd like to go back and work with the previous version.

                                                                                                                   Maybe
you should look at the current version as well as the one from midnight.
