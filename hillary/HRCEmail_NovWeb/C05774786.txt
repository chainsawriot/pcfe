Saw this on the White House website. Wanted to flag it.

President Obama announced his intent to appoint the following individual to a key Administration post:

Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel, Appointee as Member, American Battle Monuments Commission
Dr. Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel is the Vice Chair of the New York State Council on the Arts and has
served as Chair of the Historic Landmarks Preservation Center since 1995. Dr. Diamonstein-Spielvogel was the
first Director of Cultural Affairs for New York City and was also the longest-serving Landmarks Commissioner
in the city's history, spanning four mayoral administrations from 1972 to 1987. In addition, she is a former
chair of the NYC Landmarks Preservation Foundation, and a former member of the New York City Art
Commission and the New York City Cultural Commission. Dr. Diamonstein-Spielvogel was appointed by
President Reagan to the board of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council and by President Clinton to the U.S.
Commission of Fine Arts, where she was the first woman vice chair in its 100-year history. She is the author of
19 books, producer of nine television series, and curator of seven international museum exhibitions—one of
which traveled to 82 countries under the auspices of the U.S. Department of State. In addition, Dr.
Diamonstein-Spielvogel sits on a broad array of boards, including the boards of The Trust for the National Mall,
the Fresh Air Fund, and the New York State Board for Travel and Tourism.
