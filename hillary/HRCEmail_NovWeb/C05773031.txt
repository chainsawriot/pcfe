Subject: Jordan compact signing

Cheryl,

With the Jordan compact approved by the Board, the next step is 15-day Congressional notice period, and, thereafter,
the signing. Signing will be some time in October.

MCC's standard plan for compact signings is a signing witnessed by the Secretary in DC. Before my staff begins inquiries
about the Secretary's availability, I wanted to get your sense of whether the Secretary would be interested in a signing in
Jordan rather than DC. We have not signaled that as a possibility to the Government of Jordan.

Should the Secretary be interested, we could do so. But we'd need to know this soon because the Jordanians want to
proceed with scheduling the signing immediately.

Welcome your thoughts.

Thank you,
Daniel
