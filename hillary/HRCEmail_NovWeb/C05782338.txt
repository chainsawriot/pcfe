CDM -          just told me about your conversation with him this afternoon, and I've been meaning to seek you out the
past few months to do exactly the same â€” he just beat me to the punch, as I've been dithering about my next steps, in
part waiting to make sure                       Can we schedule something for sometime soon? No urgency, but
would love to have the opportunity to think through some potential options with you. Thanks!
