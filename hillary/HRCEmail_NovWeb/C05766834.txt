Thank you. I will spend next week reviewing the recent IG report of my bureau. Gave us good marks on the technical
side of what we do, but there is definitely work to be done on our organizational structure, some leadership issues in
specific offices and how we interact and communicate across our various functions. On the planning side, thanks to the
2010 look ahead memos that the bureaus prepared for you, we will be more effective in creating media and outreach
opportunities because our focus will be not just on this week, but looking ahead to the month and quarter as well. We
have been briefing-centric in the past. We will be creating more channels to communicate our messages. I know Judith
spoke with you on Monday about greater emphasis on international media. We will be restructuring part of my
operation to be able to do that. Going through these issues, I'll either be well-rested or exhausted, but I am looking
forward to 2010.

PJ

We had a little fun at today's briefing. Our friends in the media have been bugging us regarding, your holiday plans, so
we announced your departure from Washington in the following way:




"...And finally, a few of you have asked about the schedule of the Secretary of State over the next few days. I can tell
you this morning the Secretary departed Washington and she stopped at the North Pole for an important bilateral
meeting with a well known international figure. During the meeting, in a formal demarche, sung to the tune of Twelve
Days of Christmas, the Secretary outlined her aspirations for the new year. They include, and feel free to hum along:
open and accountable governments, Middle East negotiations, more civilians in Afghanistan, empowerment of women,
fewer nuclear weapons, respect for human rights, resolution of historic grievances, treaties through the United States
Senate, Six-Party Talks, dialogue with Iran, enough food for people of the world to eat, climate change legislation, and
lastly, a championship for the Boston Red Sox. Okay, that last one's not on her list, but Harold Koh and I thought it was
important that we mention that here."




It is a privilege to be a part of your team. We wish you, the President and Chelsea all the best during the holiday season
and look forward to great achievements in 2010, with one tiny exception.




P.I
