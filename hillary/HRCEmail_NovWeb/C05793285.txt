Subject:                           Dinner in NYC



Hope your travels have been less brutal than they look. I know it has been a while since we spoke of this, but I still think
it would be good for you to have an informal setting to talk to some influential new York city writers and opinionators.
So, I would propose to host a smallish dinner when your calendar permits in the coming weeks with the following people
who I know well enough to trust some level of discretion for an off the record dinner that would allow you to provide an
account of some of the highs and even some lows of policy making on Libya , china, Iran, the Arab spring and the Israel
Palestinian issue. They are: Eleanor Randolph and carol Giacomo from the New York times editorial board, Richard
Cohen of Washington post, David Remnick and Rick Hertzberg from the New Yorker, Leon Wieseltier and Frank Foer
from the New Republic, Tina Brown from Newsweek, my wife from CNN and ABC, and maybe one or two others like Tom
Brokaw.

The point is not to create news stories, but to ensure when these people deliver their inevitable assessments of your
term as Secretary they have an appreciation of some of the difficulties and complexities.

All best, Jamie
