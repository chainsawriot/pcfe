 Subject: Letter for Chief of Staff Cheryl D. Mills

 Ms Cheryl D. Mills
 Chief of Staff to The Secretary of State
 Office of The Secretary
 Department of State
 Washington, ID. C. 20520

 Dear Chief of Staff Mills:

 You will recall that about one year ago Ambasador uth Davis and I approached
 you concerning the Rangel and Pickering Programs. You very graciously took our
 concerns under advisement and ensured that proposed cuts in the numbers of
 these important programs were not undertaken.

 As you leave the Department, we want to thank you again for protecting these
 programs and for your attention to diversity issues in general. Your concern has
 made a tremendous difference and demonstrates your larger commitment to the
 overall growth of our nation and attendant society which certainly results in large
 measure from diversity.

• It is duly noted that during Secretary Clinton's and your tenure African American
  officers have been assgned as chiefs of mission in broader geographical areas
  outside of Africa, which has not been traditional in the Department. We are certainly
  aware that this is due in large measure to your diligence in ensuring that lists for
  ambassadorships and other high level Department jobs include minorities. You
  have helped to create a level playing field, for which we are very grateful.

Diversity does not just happen in a natural sense. We appreciate your constant role
in making it happen in the Department of of State. Consequently, we are really sad
to see you go. We wish you Godspeed in your future endeavours. We hope that
you will brief your replacement on the importance of the Pickering and Rangel
Programs. We also hope that you will emphasize to that person the importance of
the Chief of Staff's role in ensuring that diversity remains a priority in the
Department.       ,

Once more, we wish you Godspeed in your future endeavours, and please be
assured of our very highest regards.

Very Sincerely,


Edward J. Perkins
Ambasador (Ret.)
