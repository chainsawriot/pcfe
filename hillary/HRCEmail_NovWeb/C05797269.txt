Just so you know, my Twitter feed (I follow almost 2000 people and they are a very diverse lot) is strongly supportive of
your appearance today, as has been everyone I have encountered, from my driver to students to my housekeeper (a
Republican). You are leaving the stage as strong, decisive leader who is not afraid to stand up for herself but is also
willing to admit error and take action as necessary.
Best,
AM
