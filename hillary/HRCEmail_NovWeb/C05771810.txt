Pi, do you have an ETA of any on record statement? Would greatly appreciate getting it asap.
  Also, the editors asked me to share with you our decisions on government concerns about the first batch. We have
redacted the Libya and China cables with vulnerable sources; we are not posting the Russian cable at all. (We are
redacting other Russia and China cables.) We are not posting the Van Diepen US-Russia missile cable at all. And we are
redacting the Thailand refugee route from the Seoul cable.
  However, we are naming MbZ, AbZ and King Hamad; we are running Mr. Ruggiero's name; and we are posting the
Humint collection cable.
   Even where we've disagreed, we greatly appreciate your team's time and care in pointing out hazards. In some cases
your advice has prompted changes in the wording of stories, in addition to what we've cut out.
   More decisions to come.

Best

Scott

We are actually sorting through who will provide comment. It will be tomorrow early afternoon before we square this
away. I will keep you posted.

Thanks, PJ, and thanks for your continuing input and good humor Please don't forget the on-record stuff when you have
a minute              asked if we wanted something from DNI and I said she was free to send it but that State was the
logical commenter on behalf of the government.

On GTMO, I'm told there is an active negotiation with Ukraine that if revealed may jeopardize it. That is the one country
that everyone asks not be mentioned.
