I want the pouch given to me Sunday so I can properly review the letters. I've asked Otis to bring to me when he picks
me up then.

- marina packed your leather case in the front pocket of your suitcase and I checked that it was there.

- alice sent to your limo a pouch of notes that she would like you to sign today. Otis can bring the pouch back to the
office. You'll see that there is a whole packet. Alice is at the office -           if you would like to speak with her but   B6
here is the gist of it:

- The first set (tab a) is the same note to: Rogers, Feinstein, Dutch Ruppersberger, and Chambliss. You can sign them all
or if you are OK w the text we can autopen at the office.

- The second set (tab b) includes 2 notes per person to John Boehner and others. The two notes are similar to each other
but the second version includes classified information. But we can autopen these letters as well if you approve the text.
