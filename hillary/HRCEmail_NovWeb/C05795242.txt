Hi Lona,
I understand that the Secretary may have some time to see me tomorrow.
I am in New York and am happy to come down if she wants me too but I honestly don't have much business to discuss,
unless she has something on her mind and I am very sensitive to how busy she is.
All this to say that I am happy to come down if she wishes but perhaps it would be better to do something when I am in
DC, which I am almost every month.
Please let me know. Thanks. Joe.



With best wishes,
Joe

Ambassador Joseph Wilson
Chairman,
Symbion Power, Africa
