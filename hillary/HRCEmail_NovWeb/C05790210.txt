Subject: Blind Chinese activist arrives in United States (Reuters)

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Blind Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng arrived in the United States May 19 after
China allowed him to leave a hospital in Beijing in a move that could signal the end of a diplomatic standoff
between the two countries.

   A United Airlines plane carrying Chen, his wife and two children, landed in at Newark Liberty International
Airport in New Jersey shortly after 6 p.m. (2200 GMT) May 19, said a Reuters witness on board the flight.

   He was then due to travel to New York University in Manhattan's Greenwich Village neighborhood. Chen,
one of China's most prominent dissidents, is going to study as a fellow at the NYU School of Law, the
institution said on Saturday.

    A senior White House official, Ben Rhodes of the National Security Council, praised the diplomacy that
allowed Chen to come to the United States.

  "We welcome this development and the fact that he will be able to pursue a course of study here in the
United States upon his arrival," he said during the Group of Eight summit the United States is hosting at Camp
David, Maryland. "We are pleased that this was able to reach a resolution."

   Chen's friend, Jiang Tianyong, cited the activist as saying that he and his family obtained their passports at
the airport in Beijing hours before he boarded the flight.

   "I'm obviously very happy," Jiang said. "When he boards the plane, he can finally say: 'I'm free.' At the same
time, I feel a sense of regret because such a large country like China can't even tolerate a citizen like him to
exist here."
