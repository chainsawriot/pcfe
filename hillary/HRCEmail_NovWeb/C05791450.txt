Subject: Putin regrets NATO's plan to leave Afghanistan (AP)

 MOSCOW (AP) - President Vladimir Putin says that Russia is supporting the NATO mission in Afghanistan
by providing a transit hub and isn't happy about the alliance's planned withdrawal.
   Moscow has provided the U.S. and other NATO member states with air corridors and railway routes for
carrying supplies to and from landlocked Afghanistan. Under a new deal this year, Russia for the first time
allowed alliance members to set up a logistics facility for troops and cargo on its soil, in the Volga River city of
Ulyanovsk.
   Putin said Wednesday that the success of NATO's mission in Afghanistan is essential for maintaining
stability on Russian southern flanks. He voiced regret about the planned withdrawal of most NATO combat
forces by 2014, saying the alliance should complete its mission to stabilize the situation in Afghanistan.
