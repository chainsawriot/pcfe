           Santa Kerry? Nominee's gift for State Department staff

           From CNN Foreign Affairs Reporter Elise Labott

           WASHINGTON (CNN) - During the holidays, it's better to be Santa than Scrooge.

           That's what Senator John Kerry's staff realized, even as they scrambled to prepare their boss for his
           confirmation hearing to become the next secretary of state.

 On Friday, after President Obama nominated Kerry to succeed Hillary Clinton, the State Department
 delivered an initial set of briefing materials to Kerry's staff, including overview papers and background
 information department staff had compiled last month.

 But on Saturday an email went out to all senior managers at State, asking them—at the request of Kerry's
 staff-- to prepare potential questions and answers in their subject areas to aid the nominee.

  The email described the tasking as an "urgent, high-priority effort" due by Thursday morning, December
  27. The assignment and pending deadline would undoubtedly require work over the holiday weekend and
  Christmas Eve, which President Obama declared a holiday for federal employees.

  Apologetic in tone for adding additional work to the employees' already-full plates as the holidays
  approached, the email explained "we need to provide our Secretary-designate with a full package of
  materials to help him prepare for the possibility of a confirmation hearing early in January."

  But Kerry's better angels soon prevailed, realizing weekend work just before Christmas would not be the
  best way to introduce the new boss.

  Two hours later, another email was distributed saying the deadline had been extended until the following
  Monday, December 31st "after additional discussions with Sen. Kerry's staff." The email instructed senior
  managers not to ask their teams to come in over the holidays to work on the assignment.

  His first potential diplomatic crisis averted, Kerry is expected to work through the New Year holiday
  prepping for the hearing.
