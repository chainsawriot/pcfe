Got it. We have been in touch with Tina on both November and April. She knows about the travel commitment in
November and we have April on calender already.

Dear Hillary,
So disappointed you can't come to Hero Summit - totally understand. Ijust hope you won't be traveling
April 4-5, 2013 when we are having the Women in the World Summit in New York because that is an event
we can't possibly have without you.
Love,
Tina

 Dear Tinaâ€”

 This is a great idea, and I wish I could participate, Regrettably, I will be out of the country (as usual). But, I'd be happy to
 support the event in other ways.

 Hope you're well--and finding some time to enjoy the summer. I'm looking forward to late August
 Until then, all the best, H

 Dear Hillary,


 Hope you are having at least a handful of stolen pleasures this summer! I want to run an idea past you and
 see if you like it. I am producing a Newsweek & The Daily Beast summit in November, which we have named
 The Hero Summit. It will be a powerful two-day gathering at the Institute of Peace on November 14-15, 2012
 where we explore issues of war and peace, present the stories of men and women whose courageous service
 in the Armed Forces inspires us and discuss how we now maximize the potential of returning veterans and

ensure their continued welfare. Jane Harman is helping us with her terrific knowledge of national security
issues. And on the second night, Stephen Spielberg is giving us an exclusive screening of his new movie,
LINCOLN, followed by a discussion with himself, Daniel Day Lewis, and Tony Kushner.

We're planning a keynote luncheon conversation on November 15th and would love it if you would consider
joining with former Secretary Gates to appear together to discuss how "soft" and "hard" power can be used
in concert to approach geopolitics and national security. Given that the Summit is a week after the election,
all thoughts will be on how America begins anew and re-considers its role and responsibilities in the context
of a new economy. I think a conversation between the two of you would be agenda-setting. The audience
will be every bit as influential as Women in the World .

Is there any chance you might be available to participate in the Summit? (Clearly we would be flexible if lunch
time didn't work.) If you are able, do you like the idea of joining with Secretary Gates? I have not asked him
yet as I wanted to first sound you out. I would be so thrilled if you can do it!

Best,
Tina
