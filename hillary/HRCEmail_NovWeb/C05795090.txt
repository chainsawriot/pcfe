Sorry for the tardy reply, but I've fallen way behind on nearly everything while I hurtle around the world on my one
woman mission to convey American leadership and influence.

I think you know by now that we are working through this idea which has both positives and negatives, and I appreciate
your concerns since I am, as you know, a devoted real book person.

Speaking of which, are you in town this week and weekend? If I'm here, I will try to stop by P&P Saturday or Sunday.
Plans are still in flux, but seems likely.
All the best, H

Hillary,
Sorry to bug you about this, but I learned today in a book industry blog
about State's partnership with Amazon for Kindles for embassies. I am
sure there are great benefits to this program, but someday (maybe soon?)
I'd love to chat with you about why this news is so distressing to
independent booksellers across the country. Brad and I appreciate very
deeply that you are a stalwart and steadfast champion of stores like
Politics & Prose and all that they represent to their communities and to
promoting an informed and engaged citizenry. But right now, Indies are in
a battle for survival due in large part to the monopolistic and predatory
business practices of Amazon and the uneven playing field on which we
are forced to compete. I can't convey the scope and depth of this issue -- or
the emotion attached to it -- in one email. But I really hope we can discuss
it sometime.

On a related note, let me know when you're ready for
some more book suggestions. Did you ever read God's

Hotel, the book that Becky edited by the doctor
working at Laguna Honda in SF? It's a must read for
you. If you don't still have the galley, I'll send a hard
copy over to you.
