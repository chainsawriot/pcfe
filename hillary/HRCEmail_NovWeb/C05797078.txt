The True answer: Four years and 1 million miles = a grateful nation. Five years ago (March '08) her personal feeling
thermometer was 37% positive and 48% negative, today it is 56% positive and 25% negative.

Enjoy.

For your knowledge---until Kerry gets your help--he arrives with (31% positive and 27% negative).

Tom,

We will be releasing a special early set of numbers on the performance of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Her approval
rating is 69% and disapproval is 25%. Comparing to all the other Secretaries where there are numbers on approval--she
ranks higher than Henry Kissinger, John Foster Dulles, and George C. Marshall. Only Cohn Powell had a higher score.

Congratulations!!!

Peter
