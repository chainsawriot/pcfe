A couple of other quick, unrelated points:

-- I attended MCC Board meeting today on behalf of S. Jordan compact approved, so way clear for S to convey letter
tomorrow in Amman. Glad Philippine signing with Aquino now set for 9/23 in NY.

                                                                                                                     1.4(D)
