Cheryl,

A while back, the Secretary asked me to recommend some people for the Anti-Semitism Envoy job. I reached out to
several Jewish Community leaders who work on Anti-Semitism issues as well as Stu Eizenstat and they gave me a
number of names. Below are the names that I think would be the strongest candidates of those recommended. Let me
know if you want any further information.




Let me know if you would like any further information or would like to follow up in any way.

Andrew
