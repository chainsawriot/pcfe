Thanks, Wendy.

This may seem a bit counterintuitive, but in some respects we're a bit ahead of pace (and in others respects, slightly
behind). With respect to scheduling courtesy visits, we've reached out to all Committee members to gauge their
interest in a meeting. My suspicion is you're right -- they're all distracted by the debt talks and other associated issues.
But the requests tend to spike once a hearing is scheduled, when there's more urgency from their perspective.

Where we're ahead of pace is the review of your nomination materials by Committee Counsels. In that sense, last
week's cancelled recess bought us a couple of additional days. As you know, once that review is completed, we're all
clear for scheduling a hearing date.

Committee leadership (Majority and Minority) know you're a top priority of the Secretary and the Department. I'm still
confident you'll move through the Committee process in a fairly expedient manner. What is harder to gauge is what
happens on the floor once your nomination is reported out. Whether we'll be able to resolve whatever issues might
arise at that stage is difficult to discern. But I can assure you, we'll pull out all the stops.

And rest assured, while there are other nominees, we play favorites.
You're at the top of our priority list. And that doesn't come from just me. Cheryl and of course the Secretary share that
sentiment.

Miguel and Rob,

Thank you for all of your support. I look forward to our meeting tomorrow and to continuing to move ahead. I know that
Amber is already scheduling meetings but we seem to be a week behind the notional schedule that Miguel and Heather
shared with me that anticipated courtesy calls this week and a hearing perhaps late next week. I appreciate that one
can't push a river but wanted you all to know that I am ready to do courtesy calls this week, am a quick study, and
cancelled a business trip for this week anticipating there might be meetings.

I know the Senate environment is very complex at the moment with the debt ceiling debate leaving everyone in a hurry
up and wait mode on top of the usual July press. I know the Secretary and Cheryl had hoped for confirmation by the
August recess, witnessed by the amazing effort by everyone to get the nomination up by the end of June. I also realize
that that deadline may just not be possible. This note is to let you know that I am ready to do whatever you need me to
do as soon as it is possible to do so. Again, thanks for all of your assistance understanding that you have many priorities
on your plate, including other nominations. I also know that all nominees, including those of us who have been through
this before, are probably overly anxious to get going. Nonetheless, I am ready to go and look forward to hitting the
accelerator with you tomorrow. Thank you.

Best,
Wendy
