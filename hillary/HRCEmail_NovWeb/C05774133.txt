One of the best things we can do is get rid of the horrible term "Mommy wars"! There have been over 750,000 hits on
the piece since Wed night. Good luck this week - you make us ALL so proud.

AMS--

I'm surfacing for air and trying to catch up on all things NOT Egypt, Syria, Rio+20, G-20, Eurozone, and Supreme Court
waiting and, whoa, there you are in the midst of the so-called "Mommy wars!"

I leave tomorrow for Europe (again) and have your article at the top of my reading pile so will have more to discuss later.
Having made my own forays into this most personal and challenging of issues, I can imagine the whirlwind you're riding.
Hang on tightly!

All the best, H
