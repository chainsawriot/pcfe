Jake,
     I truly do understand how difficult it is to have a private meeting with S. So, I am entirely realistic when I ask to see if
you, Sylvia, and I might have a few minutes with her alone next week.
   It is most likely that both she and I will be out of office before we meet again. It would give Sylvia and me the
opportunity to express our views of the privilege of serving under her leadership.
     It would also give SyIva and me the chance to tell how we might hope to be allied together in the future..
    I know it will be hard to achieve but I thank you for trying.
       Sam
