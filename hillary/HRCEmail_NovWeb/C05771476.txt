Humanake,

Here is the Natalegawa call sheet. It does not/not have a point about the President's possible trip to Jakarta in
November
                 As DAS Joe Yun points out below, S knows the issue and may not need the point, but I will forward an
updated call sheet in the morning if

I also noted to EAP that this call is not yet scheduled, so the embassy should not get ahead of S on call times.

Laura:


Attached is the cleared call sheet. It does not have the tic on the President's possible visit to Jakarta in November. The
Secretary knows well the state of the play on this, so, of course, she might choose to mention it in any case.


Embassy Jakarta is checking when FM Natalegawa can receive the call.




Joe
