Dear Hillary,
Very sad days for our service. Your remarks, and those of the President, were dignified and honored the service
diplomats provide the nation. Thank you and please thank the President.
Chris Stevens was processing into the service as we were in the middle of Desert Shield/Storm and was no doubt
influenced and inspired by the efforts of our embassies in Baghdad and Kuwait during that time. He knew the risks, and
as you and the President noted, was willing to take them to make the world a little bit better.
Glen Doherty was a fellow member of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation Advisory Board, which fights to ensure
that our military is not further compromised by the Christian Dominionists who seek to turn it into an instrument of
their religious zealotry, an army for Christ rather than for the defense of our nation. He was invaluable in helping us
uncover several cases where religious indoctrination was taking place under the guise of military training. I will miss
him.
Thank you for your leadership at the State Department. You have been a terrific Secretary and I know you will be
missed. But I also know that you will continue to provide inspiration and leadership to countless billions around the
globe. Valerie joins me in sending our love during these difficult days.

With best wishes,

Joe Wilson
