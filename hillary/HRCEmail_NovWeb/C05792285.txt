PRETORIA (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Tuesday
that the crisis in Syria must not be allowed to descend into sectarian warfare and
she warned against "proxies or terrorist fighters" being sent in to join the conflict.
"We have to send very clear expectations about avoiding sectarian warfare. Those
who are attempting to exploit the situation by sending in proxies or terrorist
fighters must realize that will not be tolerated," Clinton said at a news conference
in the South African capital Pretoria. (Reporting by Andrew Quinn; Editing by
