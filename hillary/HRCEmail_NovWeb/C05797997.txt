Our HRC was fierce yesterday. Brilliant!
(And I loved your cashmere cape! Almost like you kept pulling it up to protect yourself from the stupidities
coming your way from some of the senators. Like a flak jacket.
I just did my interview with Edwidge Danticat. It needs to be edited and transcribed, so I'll send it to you in
about a week.

Much love,
Tommy
