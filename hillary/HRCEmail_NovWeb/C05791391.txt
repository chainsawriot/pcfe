It was great.

HRC owned the entire audience. Need to dial up God given potential at the beginning. Then close with it. She
looked shall I say fabulous. In charge of the whole and holistic data issue. And of course sounded like and
should be commander and chief ... love to all

Dangerous. You were terrific as well

        Agree with Maggie--she was far more engaging than the written speech would have led me to
        believe. Really brought the situation and the need to life. So glad I was there.

                I thought it was one of her best speeches. Is there some magazine on data; or
                website for data people where the speech can be printed or posted.
                It needs to be reprinted somewhere.
