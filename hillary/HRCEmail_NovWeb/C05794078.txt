Mohamed Saad El-Katatni, Speaker of the House
People's Assembly
Magless EI-Shaab Street
Kasr El-Ainy
Cairo, Egypt

Dear Mr. Speaker:

As former foreign ministers of our respective countries, we were dismayed to learn that on December 29, 2011 the
offices of seven American, European and Egyptian non-governmental organizations (NG0s) were subject to an armed
raid; their property confiscated, their staff interrogated and their doors shut. Following the raids, pressure on these civil
society organizations has increased as a criminal prosecution is proceeding, travel restrictions have been imposed on
some employees and interrogations are ongoing. Moreover, media reports indicate that up to 400 organizations may be
under investigation — most of them Egyptian organizations working in the fields of democracy, human rights and legal
awareness.

The groups raided on December 29, and groups like them, are present in countries around the world to support
democratic processes, promote human rights, advocate for freedom of the press and free association, and to assist in
the development of governing institutions. We know directly or by reputation many of these groups. We believe that
the work of non-governmental, inter-governmental and international organizations are an indispensable component of a
thriving community of democracies.

Domestic and international democracy and human rights NGOs can help support the transition plan that you and other
Egyptian officials have proposed as well as help Egyptian citizens participate fully in that process. Indeed, several of the
organizations that were raided were officially accredited election witnesses during the recent parliamentary elections
and issued constructive reports on the process.

Freedom of association and speech are fundamental to any democratic system. This is one of the most important
lessons that each one of us learned while serving our countries as foreign ministers. Non-governmental organizations
must be able to carry out their mandates openly and freely. Harsh and undue restrictions on civil society profoundly
undermine the progress that has been made in your country.

As has been the case in Europe, Africa, Latin America, Asia and elsewhere in the Middle East, the presence and ability of
these organizations to support the leadership and initiative of local democracy activists is, as you know, one signal the
international community considers to understand how an important transition is proceeding.

Egypt has made tremendous strides in the past year. Following a largely peaceful transfer of power to a temporary
military government, a referendum was held on constitutional change, new political parties formed, an election held and
a parliament seated which is reflective of the will of the people. We would urge that you not allow these positive strides
to be overshadowed by completely unnecessary actions against civil society.

We look forward to Egypt's entry into the community of democratic nations and its adherence to the principles of free
association. We would ask that you immediately end the onerous restrictions on civil society, cease the prosecution of
NG0s, free citizens imprisoned for exercising freedom of speech and move expeditiously on the path to civilian rule.
