31 ministers.

FOR            has four members, including foreign affairs, a minister delegue to territorial administration,
commerce, and elevage/peche.

CSM                         has three. IBK has one, the Tuareg at tourism. COPAM has two. Haut conseil has one. This
idea of a religious affairs minister bears monitoring.
