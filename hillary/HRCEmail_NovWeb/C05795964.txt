I'm sure that you guys have seen this already. But just in case you haven't here is Debra Sontag's article. Cheryl. Agustin,

Hopefully we will have an organized, clear and factual response ready for publication as this article is clearly slanted to
portray the PIC negatively. We should discuss this asap.
