Subject: Graham calls for delay on Brennan nomination (AP)

WASHINGTON (AP) - A Republican senator is calling for a delay in confirming President Barack Obama's
pick for CIA director until the administration provides answers on the deadly Sept. 11 assault in Libya.
   Sen. Lindsey Graham said Tuesday that he has tried repeatedly to get answers on raid on the diplomatic
mission in Benghazi, but his requests have been ignored.
   Until he gets a response, Graham said he would support delaying confirmation of John Brennan to be CIA
director.
   Specifically, Graham is pressing for an explanation on who changed the talking points that U.N. Ambassador
Susan Rice relied upon days after the attack.
   Graham said the administration's "stonewalling" must end.
