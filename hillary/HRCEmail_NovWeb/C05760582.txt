I am truly clueless as to how to advise       with respect to her aspirations! Any thoughts?

Dear Steve,

We most recently saw each other downtown at the Meridien Hotel.




State just announced the long anticipated appointment of Johnnie Cash as Assistant Secretary of State for Africa - a very
good man by all accounts. I have expressed interest in being one of his three deputies concentrating on financial
markets where I have a great depth of experience and knowledge. It won't be easy persuading people to keep their
markets open and private, having made such a mess of our own financial sector, but it is central to our long-term
security and development interests. More broadly, if the State Department is seeking an expanded role in dealing with
global economic issues, then my combination of business and government experience in Africa might be appropriate
somewhere in the Undersecretary for Economic, Energy, and Agricultural Affairs. In USAID there is a position where my
experience and skills could be helpful: Assistant Administrator — Bureau of Economic Growth, Agriculture, and Trade.

I was contacted last week by the administration for a position at EXIM Bank, but I am not the right person for export
financing for Boeing et al. I promoted the idea of shifting or emphasizing EXIM's focus to infrastructure/project finance
where the huge gap in emerging—frontier markets has only widened. I offered to help Fred Hochberg (seemed a nice
man — apparently worked in Clinton administration at SBIC) recruit someone and he kindly went back to Obama folks
suggesting OPIC is a better spot for me, but an opportunity to work at State for the Secretary would be my first choice.

Attached is my CV. I have, of course, been networking and long ago completed the formalities of submitting my name
for consideration for a policy position related to Africa applying on-line and providing references,



What I think would be most helpful is to be sure that my interest is registered at SOS with the relevant individuals and
sadly I am not sure that I know who they are, let alone have their contact details. I, of course, know some of the
Secretary's team that have moved with her to State, like Huma, but I would very much appreciate your help. Is there
any way in which you could facilitate a meeting with Johnnie Cash, Assistant Secretary for Africa? My apologies for the
length of this email, but I wanted to give you some context

Best regards,
