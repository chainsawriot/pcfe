She made us all very proud.

Thanks for everything you've done, on this issue and so many others.          HRC   is pretty
remarkable. So are you.

But we are grateful for everything you did to make yesterday possible for S.

She commented after spending several days getting prepped that some of the best answers were
yours and she was going to shamelessly crib . . . .

What she didn't know is that we already were way ahead of her in doing that in putting
together her q/a.

Thanks for making jake, pir and me look good. And for making this look and be doable for
her.

We kept saying - you all knew less than her and you hit it out of the park so she had no
choice but to bring it home.

So she did.

Thank you.

Best
Cdm
