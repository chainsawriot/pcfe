Hi Anne-Marie,

I read and loved your recent article in The Atlantic, and promptly shared it with my husband and friends.

I was taken aback, however, when the CEO of my company brought it up in a recent meeting. He was really
struck by some of the points you had made, and asked the senior management present to make sure they read
the article too. I work for a financial media company, and as you might expect it is male-dominated. My
company is also based outside the U.S. The fact that your article has managed to jump across the ocean and is
reverberating through male-oriented boardrooms is impressive, and makes me incredibly grateful to you for
speaking up about this hushed-over truth about women, careers and personal lives.

The challenge for me now, given that I have a receptive CEO, is to figure out which suggestions I can make to
help implement some of the sanity checks you mentioned.

In any case, thank you for speaking up.

Best,
Rachael Granby
