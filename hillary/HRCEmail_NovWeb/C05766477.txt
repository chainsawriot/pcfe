Re: Latest in NI negotiations

Just spoke with Shaun. He would like to speak with you this afternoon, London time, after 3 pm, perhaps 4:15
pm, or when you have a gap.                                                                             1.4(B)
                                                                                                        1.4(D)
Here's where it is:                                                                                     B1

Brown and Cowan have established a basis for a deal. Shaun is spending the next 36 hours working with all
parties to attempt brokering it. Shaun says they are close on the issues, but not at the point where they want to
cooperate to get the deal done. "Each side has an issue. There is no issue that can't be bridged. The problem is
they won't move over the edge." If they fail, McGuinness will resign.




Footnote: Cameron and the Tories have played a wrecking role. Cameron cares more about getting a few
parliamentary seats for a majority by an alliance with the Unionists than the peace process. Having made that
alliance he will be prisoner to it. It goes without saying (though I'll say it) that you've been consistently lied to.
