Questions before making Ouattara call--and copying Jake to help

What is status of their IMF debt plan and the cocoa reforms?

And is there any other issue from my visit that we had said we would follow up on like the request to fund the
construction of girls' schools?

Oscar is printing 3 call sheets for you.

1. Ivoirian President Ouattara AF and P would like you to make this call today and Jake endorses. There is also a
confidential IM on the situation in Mali that they would like you to read which we will send to you if you'd like to make
the call today. Let us know.

2. Ethiopian PM Meles -- you mentioned that you would like to see the call sheet before deciding to make the call.

3. Ugandan President Museveni -- you mentioned that you would like to see the call sheet before deciding to make the
call.

4. Per AF's recommendation, Jake says we can stand down on the call to Mashebane.
