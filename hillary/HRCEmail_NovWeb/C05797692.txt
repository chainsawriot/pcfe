a conservative news site posted these questions they say should be posed to the Secretary - most track existing
Q&A, but thought I'd share this formulation of them in case it's helpful for prep. originating site link is below
the questions.


1.What is the relationship between the current violence in Mali and Algeria and the situation in Libya?
How should the coming administration address the security situation in the region?

2. Was the Benghazi attack an intelligence failure or a security failure? There were signs that while the
attack was not explicitly forewarned against, officials were aware that the level of security at the embassy
compound was inadequate to repel a coordinated armed attack. Furthermore, the Libya government
warned of possible violence by Islamist militant groups.

3. Were there credible warnings of the attack or the threat of violence and did the Administration fail to
heed these warnings?

4. After the attack, you requested $1.3 billion to beef up security in Libya for the State Department, and
that money was diverted from the Iraq budget. Why was Libya not a priority prior to the attack despite the
tenuous security situation?

5.Lastly, do you feel that the security response to the attack was appropriate? Were there other measures
that you would take? There has been criticism that while the CIA sent a small force from Tripoli to secure
the embassy, the military itself failed to act. Critics have asked whether the military could have sent forces
of its own.
