Maria,

The summary from the embassy is below.

We anticipate that the next step in this process is                                                                        B5

(SBU) 1. SUMMARY: DCM Robert Wang and Embassy staff met with State Postal Bureau (SPB) Administrator Ma
Junsheng August 30 to discuss outstanding issues related to express delivery. Wang reiterated key U.S. requests, namely
that U.S. express delivery providers continue to have unrestricted access to the Chinese market through the use of
domestic agents; that companies be allowed to continue normal market practices, making decisions on pricing and
services according to market conditions; and that agreements on these and other issues should be formalized in
writing. On the issue of agents, Ma reiterated that the requirement for companies to have the appropriate licenses was
a matter of law and that affected companies should apply for correct licenses, but so far have not done so. Ma said
companies would need to apply for additional permits if they wished to operate or use agents beyond the cities for
which they have already received permits or where their existing operations have been grandfathered. On normal
market operations during the 3-year interim licensing period, Ma said Ftvill be allowed to conduct business as they        B4
see fit provided they 'don't create any disruptions in the industry,' but did not clarify what such disruptions might
include. He also said SPB would provide a roadmap/timetable for the issuance of permits applied for by U.S. companies
as the U.S. had requested. Ma rejected the assertion that the licensing requirement contradicted Chinese promises
made when it acceded to the WTO to provide national treatment to foreign companies in this industry. END SUMMARY

(SBU) 2. Ma began his remarks acknowledging Under Secretary Hormats' August 22 letter to Ministry of Finance Vice
Minister Zhu Guangyao. He suggested that, based on U/S Hormats' remarks in that letter, there appeared to have been
a misunderstanding of the Chinese position, and maintained that SPB had consistently sought a mutually agreeable

solution to the outstanding express delivery problems. He cited U.S.-China engagement on the issue over the last three
months as evidence of China's willingness to resolve the issue.

(SBU) 3. Ma then responded point by point to U.S. proposals he received from the DCM during their July 17th
meeting. He said that SPB would begin issuing permits September 1,
                                                                                                He said that 'there should be
no difficulty with the proposal' to develop a roadmap or timetable for permit issuance. Concerning the request that U.S.
companies be allowed to continue regular market operations during the three year interim period, Ma said that this was
not a problem so long as 'their activities do not create any disruptions in the industry,' without elaborating what might
constitute a 'disruption.' Finally, Ma said that SPB would help with
        nd he did not fully understand their concerns.

(SBU) 4. Regarding the use of agents, Ma said U.S. companies could continue to use them where permitted or
grandfathered, and that in this regard they would be treated the same as domestic companies. If they want to contract
with agents in new areas, they will be required to submit applications for new agents, he said. The DCM responded that
it is critical U.S. companies be allowed to continue using agents nationwide, not just where they have permits, and that
this stricture was likely to raise new problems because it would require the companies to apply for new permits outside
of where they are already operating. He also noted that the condition that U.S. companies' business decisions 'not
create any disruptions' during the three year interim period was likely to be problematic.

(SBU) 5. Ma then recapped his position: 1) there was 'absolutely no problem' with developing a roadmap for issuing
permits; 2) that the
            but SPB would help if it was able; and 3) that the requirement for agents to have appropriate licenses 'is firm
in our laws and regulations' and that if a company wants to undertake activities beyond the scope of its present license
then it must apply for a new license. Ma rejected the argument that requiring companies to acquire new licenses in any
way violates its WTO accession promise to open the market. He said that if

                             he concluded.

Dear Maria,

We spoke briefly this morning when you were looking for Gwen. We'd like to know if the call from
