Subject: PLEASE PASS ALONG TO SECRETARY CLINTON

Dear Secretary Clinton,

Deputy First Secretary of Northern Ireland, Martin McGuinness, arrives in DC this week, and I
understand you will be meeting with him. As one of your Observers to the International Fund for
Ireland, I have concerns about the situation on the ground in Northern Ireland and would welcome an
opportunity to discuss this with you.

My principle concern, based on my observations, is the degradation of, and lack of respect for, the
rule of law. I fear that, acting out of self interest, Unionists and Nationalist politicians in Northern
Ireland are presenting a rosier picture than what is warranted. With the British and Irish governments
distracted by by their economic difficulties, renewed American attention and energy is very welcome.

Your meeting with Deputy First Minister McGuinness illustrates America's dedication, not just to the
letter of the Good Friday Agreement, but to the spirit of the Agreement as well.

With deep appreciation for all you have done, and are doing, to sustain the peace in Ireland.

Sincerely,

Stella O'Leary
