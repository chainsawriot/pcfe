We are just leaving Catherine's Palace. The Russians went all out with top opera performers, ballet and other music. It
was all rather amazing in that stunning room. Everyone left on cloud 9. We'll miss you at the high-level meeting tomw
but your spirit will permeate the room. Glad you were here and that you finally got to see beautiful St. P. Good luck in
Geneva!
