I'll send him a polite response as soon as NEA clears some language I've suggested. They determined that asking Sen.
Specter to intervene, rather than continuing to work through official channels, would send the wrong message. And it
wouldn't have helped resolve the ICRC's problems in negotiating with the various opposition factions.

So no response to him? Even a non-substantive one?

NEA decided against it. I'll ask them for language to use in respondimg to Sen.whitehouse. I will also tell him that we
have information that, due to its sensitivity, cannot be shared at the moment although we have conveyed key elements
to the family.

Bottom line - we knew that when the generators for the refrigerator failed, those holding her remains would have to
bury them. We have heard reports to that effect.
which we will provide. But all of this is very close hold at the moment until we have confirmation, to avoid the sort of
media muddle that we saw with reports that edith bouvier had escaped.

Any news? I can't understand why no one contacted Senator Specter after I put you all in touch. He has known
the Assads for twenty years. How about the Russians?

Tell Arlen thank you. They tried to get in again today, and turned back because of danger in the neighborhood.
Has the State Department actually talked to him about this?
