Subject: Finally, The Proposal!

Thanks for your patience and understanding.

I hope that you will see that I tried very hard to incorporate the elements that I thought represented your mother and
grandmother. Those traits that I think she held dear to her:

Intelligence, intellect, ambitious young people working to make things better for others and bringing people together
from different backgrounds.

Please let me know what you think.

Much love, Gigi
