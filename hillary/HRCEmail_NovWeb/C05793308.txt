Neera--

Happy New Year to you and Ben and your family, and I hope 2012 is a great year for you and CAP.

If you think the reunion would be a good idea, please go ahead. There were so many wonderful people involved in the
campaign, and I am very proud of all they--and we--did. Onward!

All the best, H

On the reunion, I wouldn't be able to do it anything til the spring because my house is small and I need the backyard. I
obviously won't do it if you think it's a bad idea or would reflect badly.

But I did response for ABC News to the Republican debate last Sat night, and it just reminded me of the fact that you
kicked ass in the debates and more broadly, we had a campaign that changed the country. Just thinking about NH - I
mean that was historic. And at least for me, though it's taken a long time, the pain is over and I can feel pride in what
we did. And I feel like if we don't take some pride in it, then it paints the whole thing as negative, when it wasn't.

I wouldn't impinge on your schedule to come. And I can see how that would create problems for you. And look, I'd be
happy to take the heat. I deal w Plouffe and all these characters regularly, I know what they'll think. I'm happy to say
what this is and what it isn't. But people are thinking about 4 yrs ago now because of the Rep primary - so I hate to wait
til after the election. But I of course will if you prefer.

Anyway, it was great to see you. I can only imagine how exhausted you must be (now that I travel so much more for
fundraising, I'm perennially exhausted!) and yet you find time to come to things like tonight - I always admire your
generosity.

Merry Christmas Hillary.

Neera
