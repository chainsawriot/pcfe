Dear Kathleen,


It was a treat having you w me in Cartagena. I will need your help for the rest of the year to implement the 100k
initiative. I'm copying Cheryl and Lona so we can set up a time to meet when I'm back. And I'm copying Roberta so we
can be sure to schedule a time she can attend. This has such potential and I have lots of ideas.

Thx for all you're doing--H

Dear Madame Secretary,

Thank you. It has been a wonderful experience to travel with you and see you in action!!

The WE America event was terrific. It lift the hopes of so many women. Your example and your attention to
on the ground change is clearly having an effect. It is inspriring to see.

Your restraint and steadiness with the Congressional delegation was quite extraodinary. I thought it brilliant to
point out that Brazil can use the "cuba" card to solidify its support in the region. Rumors are that some did hear
the points you made. Sadly, they may forget them on the plane back!!

I am eagerly working on the education and skills develoment initiative. Much is already being done.., as
Walmart's contribution made clear. I want to make sure that we are providing the education to create a pipeline
of scientists, engineers and not simply skimming the top. The Summit helped to crystalize the challenge and the
chance to meet partners who could make this work.

All the best in Brazil, Belgium and Paris.

Kathleen
