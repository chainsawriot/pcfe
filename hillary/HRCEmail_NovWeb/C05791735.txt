Not much. We're trying to pin down whether Sharaa has in fact defected, is in the process of defecting, or is still in
Damascus. GID doesn't have good answers.

MEK has said they will move another convoy on the 23rd, so that's a step forward.

Ecuador has called an emergency OAS session on the Assange asylum case - we'll be badly outnumbered in that one.

Ban put out a statement condemning A'jad's comments about Israel, and his people say there is a chance he will not go
to the NAM summit (Morsi, meanwhile, has announced he'll go).

That's about it for this quiet August Saturday.
