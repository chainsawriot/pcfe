This is the next installment of my annoying emails.

My assistant Amira, who is phenomenal, is staffing your videos tomorrow (Case is out of town). Amira graduated from
Yale a couple of years ago and interned with Brian Deese at the NEC. He recommended her highly and I grabbed her last
year. She's really smart and driven, with really good judgment, and kind to boot. Over the last few months, she has
started writing meet and greet remarks, swearing-in remarks, and video scripts. She hasn't had the chance to meet you
properly, so it would be great if you could say hello when you see her tomorrow.
