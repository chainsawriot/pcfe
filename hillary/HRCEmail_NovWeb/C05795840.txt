Fidel Castro Suffered A Stroke, Venezuelan Doctor Says (MH)
Friday, October 19, 2012
Miami Herald
By Juan Carlos Chavez

Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and his state of health is so precarious that he has
trouble feeding, speaking and recognizing people, said a Venezuelan physician who assured El Nuevo Herald that he has
access to firsthand sources and information.

"He suffered an embolic stroke and recognizes absolutely no one," said Jose Marquina, a respected doctor who in the
past has claimed to have direct information about the illness affecting President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela.

"The people with a condition of this nature have difficulty eating and, of course, they end up with total deficit in their
neurologic capacities."

Rumors about Castro's health have circulated consistently in social networks and the media. But the speculations
intensified recently, to the point that word spread that he had died and that the Cuban government would make an
official announcement to that effect.

Castro was last seen in public in March, during the visit to Cuba of Pope Benedict XVI. Since June, he has not written his
opinion columns, called "Reflections." He did not send any message or congratulation to Chavez for his recent election
victory.

Castro is in his home in El Laguito, Havana, receiving constant and specialized medical care, Marquina said. The idea of
the Cuban authorities and Castro's family is to maintain him alive and far from public view, the doctor said.

"He could last weeks like that, but what I can say is that we'll never again see him in public," said Marquina in a
telephone interview from Naples.

Castro receives no therapy to improve his condition because his neurological state does not allow it, Marquina added.
Marquina described Castro's condition as "very close to a neurovegetative state."

"He is not receiving artificial respiration and is not connected to tubes, as some have said. What's probably true is that
Castro is being fed through nasogastric tubes," Marquina said.

He said that the death of patients with this type of clinical picture is generally caused by respiratory complications and
irreversible infections.

According to Marquina, the decline in Castro's health compelled Chavez to fly to Havana on Tuesday, to inquire about
his ally's condition.
