Subject: Meeting with Secretary Clinton

Dear Team,

Thank you for your comments about what you would like said at the meeting with Secretary Clinton and Senator
Graham. I will try to summarize them for you: first you want to express your appreciation for both her having such a
meeting and also for defending religious freedom throughout the world. You also want to express the depth of
commitment the faith community has to serving the neediest people in the world and give several examples of what you
have done. Maybe most importantly you want to share that in order to work hand-in-hand with the government there
needs to be mutual respect and an appreciation for differing religious beliefs, and that these beliefs should also be
respected. They should not become barriers to working together and we must make every effort to avoid such
conflict. Lastly, you expressed an interest in explaining how you want to impress on legislators the need for robust foreign
policy budgets and that you plan to work actively to protect both programs and funding for them. I hope that was a good
summary.

We should all meet in the lobby of the State Department at 10:00 sharp Thursday morning. At the end of the lunch
tomorrow we should also try to meet for a few minutes to go over how we might want to structure the meeting. Thank you
for your help in making this a meaningful moment in the challenges we have ahead regarding foreign assistance.

Best, Shepherd
