John--

All concerned bureaus at state have cleared. I've sent to Jim as well but haven't heard back yet. I think it's safe to
circulate.

The language on others' actions should have been sent last night. Unless Jim feels strongly, I can live with it in the q and
a.

I'm told this has broken into the press, so we're asking pa to join at 1.

Proposed timing looks good to us.
