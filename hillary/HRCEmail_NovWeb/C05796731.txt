Subject: Happy Birthday!

Dear Hillary:


There is a shocking allegation in the papers today that you have a certain birthday today! Just in case it is true, many
happy returns.


I thought you were sounding/looking great when we met                         a couple of weeks ago. Hope you get an
evening off today.

Best wishes from Louise and myself on the happy day.

David
