Madam Secretary,
Heading home today after useful trip to Beijing, Moscow and London. Had long secure call with Bill from London
yesterday so he could head to vacation. Also spoke with Tom before he took off. Know you are taking a much needed
break as well. Will work through Cheryl and Jake and others as needed over the next two weeks and seek to not disturb
your, Bill's or Tom's short break.
Best,
Wendy
