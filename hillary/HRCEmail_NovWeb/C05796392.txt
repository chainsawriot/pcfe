Per the discussion at Deputies, here are the revised TPs for HPSCI. Let me know what you think.

--The currently available information suggests that the demonstrations in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the
protests at the US Embassy in Cairo and evolved into a direct assault against the US Consulate and subsequently its
annex. There are indications that extremists participated in the violent demonstrations.

--This assessment may change as additional information is collected and analyzed and as currently available information
continues to be evaluated.

--The investigation is on-going, and the US Government is working with Libyan authorities to bring to justice those
responsible for the deaths US citizens.
