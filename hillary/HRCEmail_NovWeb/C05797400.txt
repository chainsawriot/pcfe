GALLUP: OBAMA SURGES, GETS WITHIN 3 POINTS
Brett LoGiurato I 2 minutes ago I 1,351 I 3

President Barack Obama has closed to within 3 points of Republican rival Mitt Romney in Gallup's daily tracking poll of likely voters, a
swing of 2 points from Tuesday. Obama also took the lead among registered voters.

Since Romney led by a campaign-high of 7 points on Sunday, Obama has cut the deficit to just 3 points.

On Tuesday, Romney maintained a big 5-point edge among likely voters over the president. That number was down 2 points from
Sunday's lead of seven, which had been Romney's strongest lead to date of the campaign.

Romney also led by a point among registered voters at 48-47.

Today's results will include the seven-day average of last Wednesday through yesterday. That means the results will feature all polling
from after the candidates' second debate, including one day of polling from after the third debate.

In other tracking polls released today, Romney led by 4 points in Rasmussen's survey.

We'll update at 1 p.m. ET with results...
