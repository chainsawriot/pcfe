Menendez -- on Saturday they are in speaking sessions from 9:00am until
4:00pm at the Goldman Sachs Tower in Jersey City, NJ. There is a lunch
session at 1:00pm-2:30pm at the Liberty House Restaurant in Jersey City.
That night, the banquet dinner is at 8:00pm at Ellis Island. Frankly, doing a daytime role could be easier as they will ask
you to sit for a good portion of the dinner, citing "royal protocol" with the Crown Prince in attendance.
