Hi Hillary--
FYI, email below -

                                                         who is my friend and who I told you
                          believes attendance at the ATFP Gala on October 20, black tie at Ritz Carlton 6-9 pm, by senior
Admin officials would be critically important now more than ever.

He has beer                    highly supportive of peace process, as you know. I was invitee to recent small dinner with



Can ou hel â€¢ re getting senior WH official and State Dept officials to attend the gala - see message below, ie,
                committed to attend.

Hamas and anti-US palestinian elements are attacking PA leadership                            -ironically, so are the left in
US CI Street etc.)

By the way, the APTF has invited the president and you to attend. If either were possible, that would be great.
Hope you are we

Lanny
