We successfully concluded our apec summit. Matvienka presided for Russia and the delegates competed with each
other to show they were implementing the SF declaration. It's amazing to hear what's been achieved in just one year!
Amb Klem who attended all the apec meetings this year said it was by far the liveliest and most constructive. The
Russian dep FM closed the summit and apologized for all the scheduling challenges and said he hoped all worked out to
your satisfaction in the end.
This was a critical passage for the institutionalization of women and the economy into Apec, and I'm glad Russia was
able to deliver. Thx for solidifying all of this. Many of the delegates referred to what you said in SF and how they were
heeding your call.
