Cheryl,

I am sorry I missed the Secretary's final town hall today.




The folks from my office did tell me that the Secretary said during the town hall that cyber attacks and cyber intrusions
comprise one of the biggest challenges and opportunities ahead today-- not surprising given her leadership in this area.
I very much appreciate the priority she has given to these issues.

If I don't get to tell her personally, I wanted to ask you to pass on to the Secretary, if appropriate, that its been a great
pleasure, privilege and real honor to work for her. I know she probably, and deservedly, hears this all the time, but it
has been the highlight of my career to work with her and I appreciate her support and vision. I also wanted to thank her
for elevating cyber to a new foreign policy priority -- something many other countries are now emulating. Though I know
I am but one in the multitude that feels this way, I will certainly miss her.
I was a big fan before coming here and am doubly so now.

Thanks to you too Cheryl for your help and support. I think we are on a good course now but there is much left to do and
the challenges are great. I'm sure we will get a chance to chat when things calm down.



Chris
