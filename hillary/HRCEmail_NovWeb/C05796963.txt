Egyptian FM Mohamed Kamel Amr

(SBU) Purpose of Call: To express our concern over the decisions and decrees announced by President Morsi November
22, particularly those that give him the power to rule largely by decree until a new parliament is in place.




(SBU) Background: President Morsi's November 22 decree removes judicial oversight of any presidential decisions from
the time he assumed power until a constitution and parliament are in place; reopens all investigations into the killing of
protestors during the revolution, including new trials for defendants who were previously acquitted (a broadly popular
measure, except among the judiciary); declares that the public prosecutor will be appointed by the president for a fixed,
four year term; prevents the judiciary from dissolving the Constituent Assembly and the Shura Council and extends the
work of the committee drafting the constitution by two months; and authorizes the president to take any measures he
sees fit in order to "preserve the revolution."

(SBU) The decree was immediately criticized by opposition groups and spurred country-wide demonstrations both for
and against President Morsi. Opposition politicians accused Morsi of acting as a "pharaoh" and a "dictator," and several
parties, including those led by Mohammed al-Baradei and Amr Musa, announced the formation of a "National Front" to
fight the President's declarations. The Front said it would also coordinate on demonstrations. Egyptian judges declared
a strike in all courts to protest what they see as the President's expanding his powers at the expense of theirs. Previous
clashes between secularists and Muslim Brotherhood (MB) supporters have turned violent, and protestors attacked MB
headquarters in Alexandria, Port Said, and lsmailiya November 23. The National Front condemned these attacks and
called for peaceful protests. Media reported that protests had begun across eight governorates; media report more
than 300 injured in all. In Cairo's Tahrir Square, police used tear gas to control the demonstrations. President Morsi
appeared before a crowd of supporters in front of the Presidential Palace November 23 to deliver a 45-minute defense
of the decree. The Department Spokesperson issued our statement on the decrees (attached) November 23; the offices
of the UN Human Rights Commissioner and EU High Representative Ashton Affairs also criticized the decree.

Release                                                                                            November 23, 2012

STATEMENT BY VICTORIA NULAND, SPOKESPERSON

The United States' Reaction to Egypt's November 22 Decisions

The decisions and declarations announced on November 22 raise concerns for many Egyptians and for the international
community. One of the aspirations of the revolution was to ensure that power would not be overly concentrated in the
hands of any one person or institution. The current constitutional vacuum in Egypt can only be resolved by the adoption
of a constitution that includes checks and balances, and respects fundamental freedoms, individual rights, and the rule
of law consistent with Egypt's international commitments. We call for calm and encourage all parties to work together
and call for all Egyptians to resolve their differences over these important issues peacefully and through democratic
dialogue.
