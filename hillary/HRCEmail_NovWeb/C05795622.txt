Dear David-

! hope you're well--and enjoying the Olympics--if that's possible in the midst of it all.

I will be out of the country in September but should be around in October. So, I'm copying Lona to follow up.

Enjoy the rest of summer!

Subject: Two Visits to DC

Dear Hillary:

I hope all is well (and that you are looking forward to the Olympics more than Mitt Romney!).

I just wanted to let you know I will be in DC on the afternoon/evening of Friday 7th September and for the day of
Wednesday 3rd October (and possibly Thursday 4th October).

I hope that you will be around and that we can meet up.

Best wishes.

David
