Subject:                           Gorgeous day in Little Rock!



The Ambassadors are so excited - arrivals start tomorrow at the Bill and Hillary National Airport. Just heading into the
Library - where the Cheese Dip Festival is taking place.

I hope you received the Briefing Book and sample gift basket. Stephanie just told me that the Dorothy and Virginia
exhibit is still up! And the original copy of the 19th Amendment is on display.

It promises to be a great weekend - wish you could be here! Will take lots of photos!
