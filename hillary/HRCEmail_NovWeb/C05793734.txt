Dear Lona,
Happy New Year.
You will have seen the exchange below. I know how difficult it is to coordinate schedules so wanted to reach out to you
for dates. Might I suggest dinner on February 14? I will be in DC that day en route to Tunisia to give a speech on doing
business in Africa. It could be a propitious moment to review the Arab Spring on its first anniversary. Alternatively, I
will be back in DC around the 23rd and am at your disposal thereafter.
With best wishes, Joe

Dear Joe,

I'd like to hear about your ongoing work. What about doing it over dinner w Sid and Jackie some time when you and I
are both in DC?
I'm copying Lona to ask her to begin trying to find a time that works.

And, please give my best wishes to

Dear Hillary-,

Thank you for your kind note and best wishes from the Wilson family for the New Year. I apologize for not replying
sooner. I wasn't sure how to respond to your kind invitation to drop by for a visit. I am honored, and would be delighted
to do so, but I know how busy you are and never want to waste your time, or impose. That said, I would love to bring
you up to speed on what we are doing in Tanzania and our plans in both Nigeria and Ghana. I will be in town in mid to
late February, and if you are in town, I will make an appointment then. I'm not sure who does your scheduling but I'll get
with Cheryl or Huma as soon as I know the dates.

You might know that we have engaged                      to help us navigate the fmancial institutions in DC. He and I
traveled to Nigeria together not too long ago and became good buddies. One of the things we have in common is great
respect and affection for you and your family.

Finally, thank you for your support of Global Zero. Everybody knows how tight your schedule is but appreciate your
commitment to the cause.

All the best and hopefully I will get to see you soon. I look forward to it. Joe

Dear Joe and Valerie:

First, Happy New Year to you and your family. May 2012 be a year of blessings and fulfillment for you and yours.

I miss seeing you and hope you'll let me know if, for whatever foolish reason, you come to DC where I'd enjoy a visit to
catch up.

And, I will not be able to attend the Global Zero Summit but will be sure we are well-represented for such a significant
event.

All the best always, H

Dear Hillary,
Below you will find a note from Valerie on a Global Zero summit at Yale in February. I want to take this occasion to
wish you, WJC and Chelsea and Marc all the very best this holiday season and in 2012. You have been a voice of reason
in the cacophony that passes for discourse in our international affairs, and a beacon of hope for women throughout the
world. Thank you and your family for your tremendous service to humankind. With warmest personal regards. Joe

Dear Madam Secretary,

              Joe and I have watched your world-wide travels from afar with amazement and
admiration (how do you do it??) — your energy and conviction of cause is evident, and we feel
fortunate that you are representing our country so magnificently. Thank you.




       Your office should have received a formal invitation several weeks ago from Global Zero
to speak to students from around the world interested in stopping nuclear proliferation at Yale
University on February 18th and 19th . Confirmed speakers include Ambassador Richard Burt,
Dr. Hans Blix, Dr. Lawrence Korb, Ambassador Steve Pifer, General (ret) Jack Sheehan and
myself. We would be truly delighted and honored if you could consider attending this special
event that will be so effective toward inspiring and igniting young people's passion and
concern about the nuclear threat. They will return to their various college campuses in the
United States and around the world to start Global Zero chapters so that politicians clearly
hear the voice of the people on this issue so critical to our civilization's survival. This
conference comes on the heels of two very successful Global Zero gatherings already this
year: London in June and at the Reagan Library in October.

       Also, we will be screening "Countdown to Zero" at the coming New Year's Renaissance
Weekend in Charleston, SC and hosting a panel afterward. I look forward to engaging more
folks on proliferation. To my way of thinking, if we don't get this right — then none of our other
concerns matter much.

    Attached, please find another copy of the invitation as well as information on the Yale
Summit

        Joe and I send our wishes for peaceful, happy holidays and a healthy and successful
2012.

       Thank you again for your consideration and please know that you are welcome any time
to our home in Santa Fe.

        Sincerely, Valerie Plame Wilson
