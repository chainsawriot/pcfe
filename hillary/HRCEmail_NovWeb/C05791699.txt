Subject:                       Ideas Week



Hillary- the founder of Groupon started Ideas Week in Chicago and it has been an amazing success for two
years now. Last year I did a panel with Mayor Bloomberg. This year they would love for you and I to appear on
opening night and talk about the state of the union. Great opportunity on many levels. Would be October 8. I'd
love for you to join. Let me know what you think.
