This is outrageous and disappointing after all our efforts. I'm copying Philippe so he can follow it in case it gets any
traction requiring us to respond.

Dear Cheryl:

Just wanted to give you a heads up that a film called "Stuck" produced by Craig Juntenen, an adoption advocate,
debuted in DC last night. Craig is a proponent of Intercountry adoption. The film is very dismissive and derogatory about
the roles that the Department and UNICEF play in the Intercountry adoption process. The film will be shown on Friday at
the Traverse City, MI film festival.

Also, I spoke with Neil Boothby. He mentioned that you suggested a role out of the National Action Plan at the UNGA.
Please let me know how we can assist.

All the best,
Susan
