Subject: FW: Afghanistan Q+A for S.'s SASC Hearing Tomorrow

Jake/Dave â€” I just wanted to flag that Frank Ruggiero wrote back tonight from the field and made the exact same
suggestion as I did. He said that on Kandahar, in addition to emphasizing the importance of GIRoA taking the lead and
ownership of operations, S should "note the importance of government and development lines of operation in Kandahar
and Marjah, but emphasize without enhanced security, GIRoA government officials cannot do their job, either due to
lack of freedom of movement or assassination."
