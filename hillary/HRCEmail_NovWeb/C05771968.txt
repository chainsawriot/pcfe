Quartet envoys call
Monday, October 5, 11:00am EST
David Hale (US), Marc Otte (EU), Sergey Yakovlev (Russia), Robert Serry (UN), and Gary Grappo (OQR)

Hale updated the envoys on Senator Mitchell's recent consultations in the region, noting that the parties' positions had
not shifted, but that both President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu wanted talks to continue. The United States
continued to seek a reinstatement of the moratorium and to discuss with the parties ways to meet their political needs
while portraying the episode as a delay of the talks, not an impasse. Hale said that recent Israeli press reporting on
Netanyahu's cabinet consultations was a good but not definitive sign that some Israelis may be realizing it cannot afford
deadlocked negotiations and therefore should consider renewing the moratorium. Mitchell had also pressed the
Egyptians, Jordanians, Qataris, and Emiratis to support Abbas and not foreclose any options at the upcoming Arab
                                                                                                                        1.4(B)
League meetings, and we were calling all API committee members. Hale urged the Quartet envoys to do the same at
high levels.                                                                                                            1.4(D)
                                                                                                                        B1




Acknowledging that the United States was hearing many of the same concerns, Hale said the focus was on creating the
conditions needed to continue the talks. He denied that any US letter had been delivered to the Israelis, but said
we continued to explore how to proceed in a way that met each side's needs without crossing their red lines; he
declined to discuss details. A 60 day window, Hale averred, would give the parties a chance either to accomplish very
little or to accomplish a great deal, depending on their attitude.

Noting that the Israeli cabinet was scheduled to meet on October 6,                 whether Israel might announce a
renewed moratorium before the Arab League meetings in Sirte. Regardless of the timing of any Israeli announcement,
Hale urged the Quartet to press Arab League members not to limit Abbas's options or impose artificial deadlines during
the meetings, noting good cooperation from Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, and the UAE so far. "Syria, Lebanon, and Algeria also
need to be reminded that they have a stake in comprehensive peace, which requires progress on the Palestinian       1.4(B)
track."             that, whatever Israel announced, the Palestinians and the Quartet would have to consider their 1.4(D)
response carefully.                                                                                                 B1

Finally, Hale said that the United States had not formally agreed to attend the French-hosted meeting between
President Sarkozy, President Mubarak, Abbas, and Netanyahu in late October. He also noted that the United States
viewed the Quartet as a better forum for coordination of the international community's support of Israeli-Palestinian
talks than the French-proposed "friends of the peace process" contact group.

The envoys agreed to reconnect next week or sooner, pending developments in Sirte or a possible Israeli announcement
of a renewed moratorium.
