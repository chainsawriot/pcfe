The Secretary's trip to Istanbul: U/S Sherman referred to previous conversations with Ambassador Ricciardone about a
possible S visit to Istanbul after her Africa trip — and asked if the PM and FM would be available.

Baseball Bat: Finally, U/S Sherman raised the reaction to the POTUS-Erdogan group photo and explained the
significance of the Hank Aaron bat. Sinirlioglu laughingly said the hubbub was by the opposition and was a cultural
difference that would be fine.

Subject: RE: Turkey

Frank reports strong Turkish support for S visit on Aug. 11. PM/FM likely to be available for Istanbul. I told
Frank we wanted only bilat visit, but as predicted Turks want to invite other FMs as well and turn it into a core
group.

Discussed this here. Believe Istanbul is best option, with hope to see Erdo, Day, and the Syrian
            And bilateral only — core group too complicated. I will explore possibilities with Turks.

Subject: RE: Turkey

I'm back in DC. Adding others. I've asked Frank to quietly explore this with no commitments. I'm sure Turks
will be favorable. Need to think about whether to do in Ankara or Istanbul. And whether to invite anyone else
(When I was there the other day they we're pushing to get some sort of core group together again.)
Perhaps Beth and I can grab Bill for a few minutes today to discuss options/preferences.

Not sure if you are still traveling. You still endorsing the idea of her visit on the 11th? Can we see if the turks will be in town? We
talked about it informally but can we find out for sure?
