Dear Cheryl,

Margaret Carpenter did her best to arrange a meeting between us at various points during the recruitment process. I
wanted to let you know that I am at USAID, Deputy Assistant Administrator for the EGAT Bureau. It is an honor to serve
and very much wanted you to know that I appreciated the efforts you made to have me considered for various positions.

I would be grateful if you could let Secretary Clinton know that I have always appreciated her interest in the various
projects that we have talked about over the years.

Warm regards,

Wendy Abt
