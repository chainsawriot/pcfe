Whenever you read this, I just want you to know how much Jackie and I have been thinking of you
and hoping for your good health and recovery. And many of your friends have reached out to express
the same feeling, from Gene and Diane Lyons to Sean Wilentz, and Joe Conason to, yes, Cody and
Derek (Strobe spent New Year's with Derek), and especially Carville, who was very upset (he's an
emotional kind of guy, in case you hadn't noticed), and Begala, who was praying for you--and many
others, Lynn Rothschild and Tina Brown (who wrote a very nice column with a good swipe at the evil
bridge troll John Bolton), and on and on. (I've hooked up Sean, who flew to New Orleans for a few
days, with James, who's giving him a tour of the music scene tomorrow, Thursday, and bringing him
to the field of the Battle of NO. James is on the 200th anniversary commission and Sean, of course, is
the Andrew Jackson expert.) So, very soon, Come Home, America!--at least for awhile; rest up, take
care of yourself; and, then, a lot more ahead. Talk to you whenever. As Studs Terkel used to say at the
end of his radio program, quoting Big Bill Broonzy, "Take it easy, but take it." Much love, Sid
