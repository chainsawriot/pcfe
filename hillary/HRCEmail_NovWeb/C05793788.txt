Dear Colleague,

I would like to bring to your attention the letter below regarding reports that President Obama may be
considering Ambassador Susan Rice to succeed Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State. Jam very concerned
about this possibility, and I intend to send the following letter to the president in opposition to any efforts to
nominate Ambassador Rice for the position of Secretary of State. The deadline to sign is Friday, November
16that noon.



November 16, 2012

President Barack Obama

The White House

1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW

Washington, DC 20500

Dear Mr. President:
      UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05793788 Date: 11/30/2015
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05793788 Date: 11/30/2015



        We, the undersigned, are deeply troubled by reports that you may be considering Ambassador Susan
Rice to succeed Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State. Though Ambassador Rice has been our Representative to
the U.N., we believe her misleading statements over the days and weeks following the attack on our embassy in
Libya that led to the deaths of Ambassador Stevens and three other Americans caused irreparable damage to her
credibility both at home and around the world.

       In her interviews over that time, Ambassador Rice propagated a falsehood that the attacks were
"spontaneous," the outcome of a protest "spun out of control," and the result of a YouTube video. Only on
September 19 — eight days after the attack — did the American people learn from National Counterterrorism
Director Matthew Olsen that the intelligence services considered the attack an act of terrorism and that al Qaeda
may have played a role.

        Ambassador Rice is widely viewed as having either willfully or incompetently misled the American
public in the Benghazi matter. Her actions plausibly give U.S. allies (and rivals) abroad reason to question U.S.
commitment and credibility when needed. Thus, we believe that making her the face of U.S. foreign policy in
your second term would greatly undermine your desire to improve U.S. relations with the world and continue
your trust with the American people.

         As you know, there have been repeated Congressional requests for information on the events of
September 11, 2012. Over the past month, our Senate colleagues have sent 13 separate letters to senior
Administration officials, including to you. Many Members of the House of Representatives have also sent
letters requesting answers. Our questions remain unanswered, and your Administration continues to deny
Congress access to critical information necessary for effective oversight.

       Recent reports of discrepancies between the Department of Defense and the Central Intelligence
Agency's public timelines of the events on September 11 only exacerbate the problem, and we believe these
inconsistencies deserve closer examination.

         In light of this troubling situation and the continued unanswered questions, we strongly oppose any
efforts to nominate Ambassador Susan Rice for the position of Secretary of State.

                                      Sincerely,

                                      Members of Congress

CC: All U.S. Senators

Yours in Liberty,

Jeff Duncan (SC-03)

Member of Congress
