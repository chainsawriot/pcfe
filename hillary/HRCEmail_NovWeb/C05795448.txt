I didn't get details on that yet. Will tomorrow. I expect it is Pardo,
is Gen. Nimrod Sheffer, Amos Gilad, or some combination of them and their teams. They are the usual interlocutors
with Egypt.

Credit goes to our ambassadors and most of all, you, Madam Secretary.
The best news is Dan's today: over 100 convoys entered via Kerem Shalom and the Israeli team arrived in Cairo to
discuss/address/deal with the next step! David
