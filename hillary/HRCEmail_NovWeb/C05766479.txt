  Re: Latest in NI negotiations

  Just spoke with Shaun. He would like to speak with you this afternoon, London time, after 3 pm,
  perhaps 4:15 pm, or when you have a gap.

  Here's where it is:

  Brown and Cowan have established a basis for a deal. Shaun is spending the next 36 hours
  working with all parties to attempt brokering it. Shaun says they are close on the issues, but not
  at the point where they want to cooperate to get the deal done. "Each side has an issue. There is
  no issue that can't be bridged. The problem is they won't move over the edge." If they fail,
  McGuinness will resign.
                                                                                                          1.4(B)
                                                                                                          1.4(D)
                                                                                                          B1




  Footnote: Cameron and the Tories have played a wrecking role. Cameron cares more about
  getting a few parliamentary seats for a majority by an alliance with the Unionists than the peace
  process. Having made that alliance he will be prisoner to it. It goes without saying (though I'll
  say it) that you've been consistently lied to.
