I left the schedule and call sheets on your bench.

- sending you a revised call sheet for FM Al-Saud. The Saudis have agreed to support us in HRC but folks agree that it
would be good for you to re-affirm the support.
- Indonesian FM cannot speak at 11:00am today. We can offer 9:30am or 10am on Sunday morning, while you are with
Isabelle, or during your flight to Perth.



Rest of the schedule below:

10:00 am       PHONE CALL w/SAUDI FOREIGN MINISTER AL-SAUD
              Private Residence

              Note: Ops to connect the call to the residence.



10:30 am       PHONE CALL w/ FRED SMITH Private Residence

Note: YOU Call him at                 anytime between 10:30am and 11:30am                                                B6
