       Attached is a starting grid for the Holiday Party at Whitehaven on Dec 17th.
       The first tab are those past and present Senate confirmed and the
       second tab are those who are not senate confirmed at Asst Secretary
       level.
       Please add those from 7 you want added - I believe you wanted Joe added.
       Will this include spouses?
