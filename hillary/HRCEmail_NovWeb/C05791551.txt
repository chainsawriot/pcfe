New Haiti PM vows to fight poverty, corruption

(AFP) – 7 hours ago

WASHINGTON — Haiti's new Prime Minister Laurent Lamothe vowed Tuesday to overcome forever the "bad
decisions" of past governments and give hope to "the voiceless" with an aggressive strategy to fight poverty.

"Haiti's governments in the past have made a lot of bad decisions, as well about governance, that created a
situation where Haiti depends on international assistance for just about everything," he said.

"Today, we're making decisions away from that," Lamothe added after talks with US Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton. "We are committed to doing the right thing."

Haiti, the most impoverished nation in the Americas and scarred by dictatorships and political upheavals, is
struggling to recover after a 2010 earthquake that killed 250,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands
more.

"The new Haitian government is committed to improving the fight against corruption, which we've made as our
number one priority -- education, fight against extreme poverty," said Lamothe, who only took office in May.

But he told reporters at a joint press conference with Clinton that the Caribbean nation now suffered from
raging unemployment with some 52 percent of people out of work.

"Too many Haitians are living in difficult circumstances with less than a dollar a day," he said.

He pointed to moves by the Haitian government to increase its own revenues so it had money to fund programs
such as a new energy policy aimed at bringing electricity to every home in the country.

"And of course, we are thinking of the voiceless, those that don't have the opportunity to ever speak, the most
vulnerable ones, in a very aggressive anti-poverty strategy," he said.

He highlighted a new program called "Dear Little Mother" under which 100,000 mothers in Haiti get paid cash
for keeping their children in school as well as taking part in vaccination programs.

Clinton -- whose husband former US president Bill Clinton is the special UN envoy to Haiti -- said the nation
was working hard to confront the challenges ahead.

The United States was focusing its support on agriculture to help improve rice and corn yields, health care,
infrastructure and the rule of law.

US efforts had removed seven million cubic feet (two million cubic meters) of rubble left from the quake and
helped find temporary shelter for more than a million people made homeless, Clinton said.

She also pointed to the opening of a new industrial park in northern Haiti that would create some 20,000 jobs.

"My husband and I have a very big place in our hearts for Haiti and we want to see Haiti succeed. But what it
comes down to is good leadership and responsible citizenship," Clinton added.
