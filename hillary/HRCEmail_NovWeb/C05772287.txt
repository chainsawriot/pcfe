Thanks to Anne-Marie for her help, support and for the overly generous comments. In this case, it took a village. I feel
very lucky to have had the chance to work with all of you on this and so many other things. I'll miss you!

Subject: It's sent in.

Attached is the final version of the Foreign Affairs article that I just sent in to Jim Hoge. I really
think it looks very strong, all the more so when I compare it to Secretary Gates' article at the
beginning of this year. And the reaction from Mike and Gayle at the WH was overall very positive
â€” they said it made a strong and clear case for what we are doing and want to do. I just wanted to
take a minute to say how glad I am that Lissa was able to make the time to work on this as
intensively as she has. We could not have done it without her, and it gave her a final chance (for
now) to articulate and integrate your views and your work as clearly and compellingly as only she
can. It is a fitting farewell; I just don't know what we are going to do without her.
