Subject: Chelsea Clinton visits Nigeria on health mission (AP)

ABUJA (AP) - Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of the former U.S. president and the current U.S. Secretary of
State, visits Nigeria's capital as part of a trip organized by her father's foundation.
   Clinton visited Nigeria's Aso Rock presidential villa on Tuesday and met with President Goodluck Jonathan.
She later spoke about the Clinton Health Access Initiative and its efforts to reduce child mortality in Nigeria, an
oil-rich but poverty-stricken nation.
   Clinton said she supported efforts to increase health coverage in Nigeria. She also lauded work being done to
end diarrhea-related deaths of children in Nigeria by distributing rehydration tablets. The Clinton Health Access
Initiative estimates making the tablets available to children could help prevent as many as 220,000 child deaths
a year in Nigeria.
