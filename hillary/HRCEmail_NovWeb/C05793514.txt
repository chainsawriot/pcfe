Hillary,

If we might find a time to chat briefly, I would like to get your advice and counsel on a few alternatives on where I might
continue to serve in the Administration. All is well at the CFTC, but it would be wonderful to benefit from your views on
how to consider other opportunities to contribute.

I know how challenging your schedule must be, but if free, just let me know what moment to talk works best or even call
me on my cell at

Gary
