Subject: Short conversation with the Secretary

Hi Cheryl:

Following the staff meeting, the Secretary was very gracious to me this morning, and after we
discussed my following in Brian Atwood's footsteps, she asked me about good choices for my
successor. I told her I had mentioned four names to you -
                                    , and I sung their praises. She seemed most interested in
but said she'd been promised            I told her I thought       might prefer PRM, and the Secretary
seemed intrigued.

Thought I ought to pass that to you.

Best,
Eric
