Don't worry too much about it. I'm sure I'll muddle through whatever.

We're going to think about some new angles - and I have a couple angles - but I do want to provide some context.

Because I was nervous that we couldn't thread the needle on the Podesta speech, we set this up as a townterview (so
there wouldn't be an expectation that you were giving a major speech). We have a charismatic Danish host who will ask
a series of questions - on the future of Europe, Afghanistan, Syria, jet lag, etc. - and invite audience participation. I
concede that you may have to contend with some thorny questions, but I think the vibe will be good. So you shouldn't
feel like you need anything more than a scenesetting topper before settling in.

Still and all, we owe you the best possible opener and will keep working it.

Subject: Any other speech ideas?

As you know, I'm concerned about this event tomorrow but not sure there's anything I could say in the speech that
would assuage that.

Also, I know the original idea was Podesta's, but I don't see how I can deliver a progressive economic speech in Denmark
that wouldn't be viewed as either political vis a vis the election or intrusive into the eurozone deliberations.

So, there's not much to say unless you have other ideas.
