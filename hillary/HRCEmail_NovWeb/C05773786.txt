Subject: Note for Secretary Clinton

Joanne,

Do you mind passing this note along to the Secretary from Mr. McLarty?

As always, I appreciate your help with this.

Best,
Katie



Dear Hillary,

Your conversation (it really was a performance) with Jim Baker moderated by Charlie Rose was a true tour de force. I
genuinely wish you could have heard some of the comments after your session. At this point I think you may truly have a
majority of Republicans (or at least a significant minority) who are willing to vote for you for President. You wowed them
and everyone else. And as for our mutual friend, Secretary Baker, he's still got it and he's Texas through and through.

Enough said, but since I didn't get an opportunity to see you at the event I wanted to be sure to convey my feelings to
you.

On a final note, Donna and I just returned from the U of A where we had uplifting and great visits with the students that
we are sponsoring on their effort to travel to Ghana. It's a joint consortium of the Walton Business School, Fulbright
College and Clinton School of Public Service and Vital Voices is integrated into the visit as well since the Ghana effort is
focusing on women entrepreneurs. In that regard, we have some developing thoughts that I'd like to share with you
when we're able to arrange our dinner. We have much to talk about but I promise to listen more than I speak when
we're together.

Hope and trust your time in Rio was a bit more enjoyable and productive than you thought it might be. It was frankly
important that the US be represented at the highest level at the Rio +20 and your being there accomplished that.
Understand from my partner, Nelson Cunningham, that you're going to be speaking to the US-Spain Council at Ellis
Island with Senator Menendez. You're covering all of the bases Secretary Clinton but of course your workload is rather a
light one these days. 0

Personally,
Mack
