Jake,

Hi from London.

As you know from my update email the Anti Hate campaign we launched is a partner with the Olympics. Cheryl had
asked that I speak to Alec about making the S mark on this campaign as powerful as possible.

I had a super mtg yesterday with Cameron's innovation guy thanks to Alec. Jonathan Luff is very, very eager that they
make the most of the campaign and while he knows FLOTUS is leading the delegation, stressed Cameron would love to
see S at the games somehow. He also said if she did, he'd want to do something around the campaign since she
launched it.

I'm writing because I know she will see Cameron in the next few days for mtgs.




                              Jonathan said this meniton by S to Cameron would be very useful. Cameron may mention
the campaign to S as well.

Do you think you can make a side comment to Cameron happen to give the push we need?

Thanks,
Farah
