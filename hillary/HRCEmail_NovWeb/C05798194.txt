Cheryl.

I wanted to reach out to you personally to say Thank you for all of your support. It has been a great experience.

I also want to let you know that I will not be at S last meeting\reception at her home because I am participating in a local
elected leaders women's conference              My speech is on Thursday and will miss this very special farewell for S.
Boohoo!

Can not believe I am not there to raise the glass with the other team members.

I am looking forward to meeting you for lunch after you get a little rest.



Talk soon.
