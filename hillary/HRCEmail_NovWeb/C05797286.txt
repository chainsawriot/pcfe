The Secretary's Call Sheet for
Former Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri [sawd ha-reer-ee]

Sunday, October 21, 2012 at 9:30am


(SBU) Purpose of Call: To express condolences for the death of Hariri's close ally and confidant Brig. Gen. Wissam al-
Hassan fwee-saam




•    (SBU) Death of Wissam Al-Hassan: I was truly shocked by the atrocity in Achrafiyeh [ash-raaf-eee-yah] on Friday
afternoon. Please accept our condolences on the loss of Brig. Gen. Wissam al-Hassan, a man who I know meant a great
deal to both your father and you. He was a true Lebanese patriot and served his country very effectively. I can only
imagine the horrific memories that Friday's vile attack brought back for you and your family. The United States
condemns this terrorist attack in the strongest terms and we stand with the Lebanese people at this critical juncture.

(SBU) Background: ISF Brig. Gen. Wissam al-Hassan was a key confidant of both Saad Hariri and his father Rafik, who
also perished in a car bomb in central Beirut. Al-Hassan was admired by many anti-Asad Lebanese, who were delighted
by his August arrest of Asad-ally and former minister Michel Samaha (mee-shell sa-ma-ha] and exposure of a SARG-
directed plot to assassinate March 14 figures. Al-Hassan was also a pivotal figure in the early investigation into the
slaying of Rafik Hariri.
