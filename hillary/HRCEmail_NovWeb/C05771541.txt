Subject: Changing the Game on the West Bank

I am trying hard to limit my emails to one a day, but to follow up on my email about a Pledge for
Palestine (which several of my best staffers are now working up with                        as an
actual proposal with options that we can send you asap), why don't we launch a public diplomacy
campaign on the West Bank around The ARC video? The campaign could focus "what peace could
look like," and include US and EU diplomats in Israel, Jordan, and Ramallah, Tony Blair and his
people, etc. showing the video and talking about the investments already underway. If we asked
her, Judith could do a spectacular job with this. And why not bring Alec in and get a 21st c
statecraft dimension — we might be able to send the video or a short version to cell-phones; or at
least messages about where it is being shown.
        Indeed, we are thinking about tying a Pledge for Palestine fund to actually funding The ARC
— again, this is not a pie-in-the-sky proposal but one carefully worked up and costed out by Rand. It
is also something we could try to get some of the companies and individuals on our Partners for a
New Beginning board to invest in.
       We HAVE to get out of the box we are in — govt to govt positions are locked in. Fayed and
Abu Mazen have to be seen in terms of what they have done and what they could bring, and
obstructionists have to be seen as standing in the way of a realizable vision of economic growth
and opportunity. Let's do something new.
