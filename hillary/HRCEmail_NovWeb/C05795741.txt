Hillary: These are some rough notes for Bill for his convention speech. I've sent to his secretary but don't know when he
might get them because it's August, people are on vacation, etc. Could you forward this to him? I don't have his email.
Hope it's helpful in thinking about the speech. He can use or not use, but want to make sure he gets it. Thanks. Sid
