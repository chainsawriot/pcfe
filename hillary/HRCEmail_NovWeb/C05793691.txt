Just to add more on this: the French deployed 30 soldiers to their embassy; the remaining 170+ remain at the
airport. (We had heard the total was 200 soldiers.) Those 30 would also be used to protect our staff at the Chief of
Mission Residence (CMR), which is adjacent to the French compound and the PAO residence, which is next door to the
CMR. Those soldiers are not currently deployed to our properties, but would come over if necessary.

Separately, the CAR government has dispatched some gendarmes (4-5) to our embassy and have also promised to
deploy gendarmes to the CMR.

Subject: France deploys soldiers to protect embassy in CAR (Reuters)

PARIS (Reuters) - France has deployed soldiers already in the Central African Republic to secure its embassy
in the capital Bangui, after protesters threw stones at the embassy and some managed to enter the compound,
the defence ministry said on Wednesday.

   President Francois Hollande ordered the ministry to take all measures to ensure the security of the embassy
and French nationals in the country, his office said in a separate statement.

   France has 250 soldiers in the country, based at Bangui's airport, for an existing peacekeeping mission, the
defence ministry said.
