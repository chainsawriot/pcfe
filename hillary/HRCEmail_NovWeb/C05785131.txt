Cheryl::

I promised you I'd let you know the very moment I had made a decision on the Humphrey School.

And in what has been the most difficult career decision I have ever confronted, I have decided to accept their offer. It was
so difficult because I cannot imagine a more meaningful and fulfilling position than the one I now hold. And I cannot
imagine a more inspiring leader than the Secretary â€” or more support than that which I've received from you, and from
others on her senior-level team.




I've always believed deeply that how one leaves a job is as important as how one executes his or her responsibilities while
on the job, and I'm committed to ensuring that my transition does not impair the Department's humanitarian (or QDDR)
work. To that end, and with the Congressional schedule very much in my mind, I have arranged with the University a mid-
October start date, which should give me the chance to bring to closure a number of very important Bureau humanitarian
initiatives and, more importantly, should give the Department adequate time to ensure a smooth transition. And I will do
everything I possibly can to help you on that front.

Because news of this may get out, I'm planning to send the Secretary a personal note today (on which I will copy you), but
I wanted to be sure you were the very first person to know.

Kind regards,
Eric

PS I have tried to call Maria (who knew I was considering this), but she hasn't gotten back to me. I will email her as well if
I do not hear back today.

This email is UNCLASSIFIED.
