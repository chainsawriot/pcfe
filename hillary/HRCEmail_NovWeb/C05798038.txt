Dear Huma,

As you start preparing to move on to life after the State Department, I wanted to say thank you. The small things you
did, and the personal touch of the Secretary, always made me feel appreciated. Despite the hectic pace of the life you
all live, you all genuinely care about the people around you and it shows. I hope that wherever you go next, we keep in
contact and that I meet more people like you and the rest of the team as life's journey continues.




I don't know if you remember that, but when we were in El Salvador for President Funes' inauguration, I missed
                          As they are both big fans of the Secretary, I asked you if she might sign her name on a card for
them. You quickly said yes, and when you turned the card back to me the following day it had a beautiful message
inside both congratulating them and telling them how proud they should be                  And when the Secretary
boarded the plane to head to Honduras, she told me that once she left, I should be sure to call            and wish
them a                    from her as well. That card is framed (with the inside message copied and next to it) and on
the wall in                   Nith a photo of me and the Secretary beside it.




Thank you not only for making that moment happen, but for helping me feel like I mattered not only as an employee but
as a person.

I hope that the Secretary is recovering well, and that you and the entire team and your loved ones have a 2013 filled
with good health and happiness.

Best regards always,
Jason
