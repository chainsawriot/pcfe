Madam Secretary,

Tomorrow morning there is a pre-brief for you                    but I also wanted to send you a quick note with a little
bit of context in advance.




Please let me know if you need any further information.

And last, but most importantly, congratulations on your daughter's wedding! Mazel toy! It looks like it was a beautiful
day.

Best,
Mike
