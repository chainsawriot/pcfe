EUR had already researched Capricia's lineage and rank - and she does in fact seem to be the highest ranking Croatian-
American official in the Administration.

I met her dad in his home town, and she and I have been in touch about that. Hard to say categorically -- there may be
some Croatian-American Under Secretary in some other Cabinet department -- but she's the highest one we know of.
Cheers. Jonathan

Wow, you're like Capricia's biographer!

So she's highest in the admin?

This came up recently at the swearing in earlier this month for the new U.S. Ambassador to Croatia, Kenneth Merten.

I believe she is. U.S. Senator Mark Begich is considered the other prominent Croatian-American in public/government
service. FYI, technically her father (Franjo/Frank Penavic) is an ethnic Croat from Siroki Brijeg in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Great

Somewhat of a silly question, but can we determine if Ambassador Capricia Marshall is the highest ranking Croatian-
American in the USG? Or something to put her in context, for when the Secretary introduces Capricia to them,
something they'd appreciate.

Happy to help; I'm her boss. Susan McFee is the desk officer. She's TDY in Zagreb for the S visit.

Hi - I'm with Phil on S's trip and I have a question for the Croatia desk officer - who is that?
