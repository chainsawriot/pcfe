               U.S. Embassy Statement on MOU and the Transfer of Prisoners

The United States has transferred over 3,000 prisoners to the Government of Afghanistan. We
look forward to continued implementation of the MOU to which we are committed.
Ambassador Grossman made clear in his discussion with the President that the United States
fully respects Afghan sovereignty. There is no question of our commitment to fully implement
the MOU in recognition of Afghan sovereignty and the need to protect the security of Afghan
civilians, Afghan National Security Forces and Coalition forces.
