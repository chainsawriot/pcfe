Folks --


Here is a first draft. It needs a lot of editing and tightening. I'm happy to take your edits for that, but I'm also happy to
do it myself if you just send me comments on substance. JoAnne, you'll see that I need some help on the history of this
up top, though. You'll see that there a few sections here -- a draft memo, that "hard questions" Jake wanted, and TPs
for the lunch and PSG.


Barney, this comes out of the meeting you couldn't make yesterday. I think the assignment is self explanatory, but I'm
happy to give you some background by phone if you want.


If you can have comments to me by mid-afternoon-ish, I'll go in tomorrow night and send it to a wider group for
comment by about 9:30am Monday.

Thanks,

JB
