Clinton challenges Africa to embrace democracy
MATTHEW LEE I August 1, 2012 09:54 AM EST I Associated Press±

DAKAR, Senegal — U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is challenging African leaders to embrace
democracy and partnerships with responsible foreign powers to improve living standards and address core
causes of extremism.

Clinton told a university audience in Senegal on Wednesday that unlike other countries, America is committed
to "a model of sustainable partnership that adds value, rather than extracts it" from Africa.

The comments were veiled references to China, which is rapidly expanding its involvement in Africa in search
of energy and resources for its own growing economy.

Without mentioning China, she said that unlike other countries, "America will stand up for democracy and
universal human rights even when it might be easier to look the other way and keep the resources flowing."
