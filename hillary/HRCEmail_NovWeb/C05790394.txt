Thanks so much for getting to this so quickly. I'll send off that revision.

I'm planning on leaving sometime between 12/1 and 12/21. That phrasing seemed the most felicitous since I don't know
the exact date.

Thanks

My chief suggested revision below:

Daniel Benjamin, U.S. Ambassador-at-Large and Coordinator for Counterterrorism, has been named the Norman E.
McCulloch Jr. Director of the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding. INSERT HERE: Benjamin, who
will remain in his current position at the State Department through the fall, begins at the Dickey Center on January 1,
2013. Benjamin succeeds Kenneth Yalowitz, who served as director for more than eight years before retiring last
December. [



Note: does fall mean through 21 Dec?

Cheryl,

Sorry to disturb your Memorial Day. The Dartmouth folks finally sent me a draft press release, which they are eager to
get out tomorrow. It was not in great shape, so I've rewritten, but if there is any way you could have a quick look, we'd
all be most appreciative. I fixed it so it was clear that I would be at State for quite a while to come and would start in
Hanover in January.

Bests,

Danny
