Cheryl,

I just had a productive exchange with                                              (she has been away). But it
validated something I suspected -- that she predicts will lose my current job as
                    if I take the job with State. This is because I have a very conservative board who will be
frustrated if I take this much time away, and also they are generally pretty far to the right.

But surrendering my current job is not necessarily a problem, because I'm willing to give it up if I can find a
replacement position for after January 2013, when the Secretary steps down. But it means some more work to
verify that        will re-hire me in a new position, or that another university will. I had earlier asked if you
thought        might be amenable, and you said that it was hard to know, but if there are any possibilities there,
this might be a good time to ask. I also have good contacts at            and will write the president,
        In other words, I will do all I can to make this happen. I want to work for you and the Secretary, and do
a great job.

thanks,

 Cheryl,

 I apologize to you for the delays -- I'm sure they are frustrating to you. I'm doing all I can this week to move it
 forward. And, as always, I'm happy to do any memos or writing of any kind if it helps you. Will write back
 soon.

 best,
