Subject: Palestinian's UN recognition quest on hold (AP)

RAMALLAH (AP) - The         Palestinian foreign minister says the Palestinians are putting their quest for
international recognition at the U.N. on hold for now.
   Foreign Minister Riad Malki says President Mahmoud Abbas has decided not to apply at the General
Assembly session next month, although he will informally appeal for recognition in a speech.
   The decision stands in contrast to last year, when the Palestinians asked the Security Council to admit them
as a full member state.
   That bid failed in the council. Since then, they have said they will apply to the General Assembly for lesser
"nonmember state" status.
   Analysts expect the Palestinians to resume their campaign after the U.S. presidential election.
   Malki spoke August 28 from Tehran, where he was attending a summit of non-aligned nations.
