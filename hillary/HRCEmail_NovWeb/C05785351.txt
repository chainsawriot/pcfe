Great news.

The Committee wants to accommodate our request to hold Bill's confirmation hearing the week of May 23 and having
his nomination up there helps us make the case for moving forward expeditiously.

Thanks to everyone who helped push this along.

Today is a big one...

This afternoon the White House will announce its intent-to-nominate Bill Burns as Deputy Secretary, and forward his
nomination papers to the Hill.

I will let you know as soon as this is out.

Thanks.
