       Unbelievable but predictable. I sent this along and hope it is used. Can you think of anyone you
       can send it to?

       The WH should use this on all the Sunday shows, saying that this is the true GOP agenda and
       Boehner is behind it. Name Boehner. Force Boehner out. Sid

       AUDIO: GOP Rep Says Shutting Down Govt, Even The VA, Is Worth 'The Pain' Because Govt
       Is Full Of 'Gangrene' <http://thinkprogress.org/2010/09/10/westmoreland-shut-down/>

       Lynn Westmoreland and John Boehner <http://thinkprogress.org/wp-
       content/uploads/2010/09/westmoreland.JPG> During a speech at the Faith and Freedom
       Coalition <http://www.ffcoalition.com/> convention today, Rep. Lynn Westmoreland (R-GA)
       explained that as a recruitment officer for the NRCC, the Republican campaign committee in
       charge of electing House Republicans, he picked candidates that would stand with the caucus in
       unified campaigns to slash government, starting with health care.
       If Republicans take back the House, Westmoreland said, they would use their new majority to
       force a budget battle akin to the fight staged by former Speaker Newt Gingrich with President
       Clinton and shut down the federal government. Westmoreland cautioned that he was fully aware
       that such a move would close down hospitals for veterans and shut down National Parks. But,
       Westmoreland argued that taking down the government is worth "the pain" because health

  reform and government programs are like a "gangrene" that "need to be cleaned out":

  WESTMORELAND: If we hold the line, if we get those courageous men and women to be part
  of our majority. If we say look, the American people we're listening to the American people, this
  is what we're going to do. If government shuts down, we want you with us. We want you with
  us. We gotta have you because later on you all will call us and say look I didn't get my check.
  Daddy can't go to the VA. You know, the National Parks are closed. We need to be sure that you
  are with us because let me tell you this, all Americans need to understand. We need to
  understand this and I hope you can help share this analogy with people. Just as when you talk
  about what is going to possibly happen, you know I was unfortunate to cut myself with a
  chainsaw. I don't know how many of you have cut yourself with a chainsaw. Chainsaw is not the
  cleanest instrument if you're going to cut yourself. [...] He said this is going to sting a little bit
  and it hurt like crazy. But you know what, if he didn't clean out that wound, it would have never
  healed. I would have got gangrene. I would have died from it. And what has happened with this
  country, we have put bandaids on things that need to be cleaned out. It's going to take some pain
  for us to do the things that we need to do to right the ship.

  Listen here:
  Gingrich, who spoke after Westmoreland, has repeatedly
  <http://thinkprogress.org/2010/04/09/gingrich-shutdown-2-0/> advised that the GOP should
  follow through with a plan to shut down the American government.
