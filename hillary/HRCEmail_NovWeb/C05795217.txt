Spain's king ousted as WWF honorary president

  MADRID - (AP) The World Wildlife Fund's branch in Spain says it has ousted King Juan Carlos as its honorary
president, a title he'd held since 1968, because the monarch's recent elephant hunting safari was incompatible with the
group's goal of conserving endangered species.

   The fund said in a statement that "although such hunting is legal and regulated" it had "received many expressions of
distress from its members and society in general." It says members voted in a meeting in Madrid on Saturday to "to get
rid of the honorary President."

  News of the king's April elephant hunting trip in Botswana upset many Spaniards who considered it an opulent
extravagance at a time of economic distress in the country.

  The Royal Palace declined immediate comment on the WWF announcement.
