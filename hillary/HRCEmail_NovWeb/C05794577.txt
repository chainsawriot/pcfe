There is probably no greater islamic authority for sunni muslims than him (there are actually a few of them, but he's the
oldest). And they don't do this often.

Subject: Saudi Grand Mufti calls attacks on foreign embassies un-Islamic (Reuters)

RIYADH (Reuters)   - Saudi Arabia's Grand Mufti, the highest religious authority in the birthplace of Islam, on
Saturday denounced attacks on diplomats and embassies as un-Islamic after deadly protests against a U.S.-made
film mocking Islam's founder.

   Sheikh Abdulaziz bin Abdullah Al al-Sheikh also called on governments and international bodies to
criminalise insults against prophets and excoriated the film that has prompted a wave of fury across the Middle
East.

   "It is forbidden to punish the innocent for the wicked crimes of the guilty, or to attack those who have been
granted protection of their lives and property, or to expose public buildings to fire or destruction," he said in a
speech carried by state news agency SPA.

   Describing the release of the crudely made short film as "miserable" and "criminal", he added that attacks on
the innocent and diplomats "are also a distortion of the Islamic religion and are not accepted by God".

    At least nine people were killed after noon prayers on Friday in demonstrations across the Middle East.
