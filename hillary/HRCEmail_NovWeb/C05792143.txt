CHINESE PRESIDENT HU REAFFIRMS SUPPORT FOR EURO RECOVERY
(SBU) During German Chancellor Merkel's visit, President Hu underscored the important role of the IMF in
resolving the European debt crisis, media report. He added China is ready to safeguard the stability of the
global financial system. The China desk comments China previously expressed concern about bailing out
Europe, but appears to have decided the consequences of inaction could be worse. The Office of the Chief
Economist adds the Eurozone crisis poses considerable risks for China. President Hu's comments might reflect
frustration with the slow resolution of the crisis and could suggest Chinese authorities want the IMF to play a
more decisive role. (Ops/China desk tekon and e-mail, Ops/Office of the Chief Economist tekon and e-mail,

GHANAIAN PRESIDENT MAHAMA TO RUN IN DECEMBER ELECTION
(SBU) Ghana's ruling National Democratic Congress party formally nominated President Mahama, who took
office following the death of President Mills, to face National Patriotic Party candidate Nana Akufo-Addo,
media report. The Ghana desk comments Akufo-Addo and his party are predicted to win the election and
recapture parliament. Disappointing oil revenues and the concealment of Mills' failing health eroded electoral
confidence in the governing party. (Ops/Ghana desk tekon and e-mail, AP)

ANGOLAN POLICE ARREST OPPOSITION MEMBERS ON EVE OF VOTE
(SBU) About a dozen opposition party members demonstrated at the electoral commission building to demand
observer credentials for the August 31 national election, media report. Embassy Luanda comments the electoral
commission has handled most preparations well but has faced problems credentialing observers, leading many
opposition parties to fear the election will not be free and fair. The main opposition party, which fought the
incumbent party during the civil war, declared it will reject the results if it considers the process
fraudulent. (Ops/Embassy Luanda tekon and e-mail, Reuters)
