I'm sitting here in Haiti with Grace Nelson and Pam White and we're singing your praises. (Nan Ellen is here too). Pam
was eager to do events to celebrate the difference women are making in Haiti.

It was 14 years ago almost to the day that I was here with you. The group of women from Haiti who were at VV/Uruguay
conf. came to the ambassador's residence to tell you that you had so inspired them that they were forming a Haiti
version of VV. I told everyone gathered at the residence tonight about that meeting which had taken place with you on
the same spot where we were all gathered tonight.

The NGO is today the premier women's organization (and many were here tonight), They managed to get a 30 percent
quota for women in govt passed and they now hold over 30 percent of the ministries, They are also the driving force for
growing women-run SME's.

Grace was so excited to hear about the launch of the State Dept Artisans Alliance that she's going to come to the launch
event on Tuesday at State. The Alliance will be housed at Aspen. You can't make the launch, but we have mention of it in
your Business Council remarks and we'll have a few of the key leaders there for a photo at the end of the Council
meeting.

Anyway, your inspiration continues to be very palpable here all these years later.
