I hope that the notification of date might make them somewhat more restrained.                                            B1

Subject: Message to Haddad



I called Essam Haddad, and I conveyed the message about the date, with the additional message that Bill Burns asked
me to convey.

Haddad said they are recalling their ambassador from Tel Aviv for consultations and they have asked their Permrep in
New York to call for a special meeting of the UN Security Council. He sounded                  about the loss of life in B1
Gaza. Haddad said that he had tried to call me about three hours ago to discuss the steps they were planning to take 1.4(D)
but had been unable to reach me. He reiterated several times that the                                          and that
targeted killings were "not acceptable." He said demonstrations were anticipated in Cairo tomorrow calling for a break
in relations. (He reiterated that there would be adequate security at our Embassy. ) Apparently, the Arab League is 1 . 4(B)
holding a meeting as well.                                                                                             1.4(D)
                                                                                                                       B1

                 I- they are not planning on breaking relations or expelling the Israeli Ambassador in Egypt - and there
have been                                                                                as well, although he was less sure
about the second. He said that Shehata talked to his Israeli counterpart but "with no results." They sent a stiff message
to the Israeli ambassador in Egypt.                                                                                         1.4(B)
                                    We had some back and forth about the threat to Israel from the rockets in Gaza and 1 . 4(D)
the threat to Israel. I understand that Amr is trying to call S about this.                                                 B1
