Issa targets Hillary: Big mistake
By Brent Budowsky - 10/10/12 04:03 PM ET

Don't miss the story in The Hill "Issa closes in on Clinton" about Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) aiming at his
biggest target yet, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The story is correct. The Issa strategy will backfire. It will
prove to be a disaster. House Republicans, whose brand is not exactly soaring with voters, are making a huge
mistake using congressional hearings as a partisan weapon to exploit a national tragedy to attack one of the
most admired and respected public servants in the nation.

There is now an independent and nonpartisan investigation of exactly what happened in Libya. A partisan
witch-hunt by Republicans using taxpayer money against Secretary Clinton, as a partisan weapon in the closing
days of an election, to exploit a tragedy to score political points is exactly what the American people believe
has gone wrong with Washington, and is exactly why the Republican brand is in such disrepute with many
voters.

Many independent voters will be offended. Many female voters will be offended. Many voters tired of their
taxpayer money being wasted for political shenanigans will be offended.
