The women's conference was a huge success, very substantive and, I believe, will further galvanize women's leadership
in Kosovo and the region. Your video made big news and helped President Jahjaga who is being attacked by various
political leaders who are challenging her staying on as president. She is very popular, a bridge-builder in the country and
does wonders for Kosovo's image, but that doesn't seem to matter to the old-style operatives.
It was emotional to be there and to see so many who risked much during the conflict to inform us and to care for their
people. I saw both Vjosa and Aferdita who visited with you at the WH and told you what was happening to the Kosovars
back then.
They are both exceptional leaders today.                                                                                    1.4(D)
                                                                                                                            B1

MKA did the opening of the conference and I did the closing. We had many good meetings both separately and together.
One was with a group of Serb and Kosovar women who are working together in the communities across the divide to
address real problems. They are precisely the kinds of people who need to be in the dialogue with the Serbs, or at the
least the issues they know so well have to be addressed in any formal discussions.

Everywhere, the request I got was the same: "Please tell Mrs. Clinton what she means to us." I don't know how we
continue all this, but I hope that somehow the State Dept will keep much of this going.

                                                                         The embassy brought together women              1.4(D)
leaders from across the country from all the communities to create an agenda for action. We made it one of your          B1
strategic dialogues with civil society. It was an impressive group.

Capricia gave me a bracelet to give to President J from you. She wore it constantly and said to tell you that you were
with her at all times and she's very grateful for your support. MKA told her she was "one gutsy lady."

 I hope you're surviving all the challenges. I heard you saw         and provided excellent advice. Thank you!              B6
