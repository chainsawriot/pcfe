  The world's best loved species are being slaughtered by widespread and dangerous criminal networks. Driven by a
  voracious demand for illegal animal parts and products, the black market in wildlife rivals illegal arms and drugs.
  Increasingly, wildlife traffickers are the same kingpins involved in trafficking people and arms and narcotics.

  WWF is joining the call to action put out by Secretary of State Secretary Clinton to raise awareness and engage
  conservationists like you on Wildlife Conservation Day, December 4.
