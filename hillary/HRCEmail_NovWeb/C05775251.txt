Cheryl,

Thanks for your tireless help on this. The package went over yesterday with a cover nomination letter from Raj. The
letter from the Secretary will help further empower me to get this difficult job done. As part of the process I submitted a
personal statement on my vision for the DAC.
You and the Secretary may want to look at it. I hope it captures the importance of the position and warrants all the good
work you put into it. With only a few hours to go, no other candidates have emerged. I won't celebrate until midnight
Paris time! Many thanks.

Brian
