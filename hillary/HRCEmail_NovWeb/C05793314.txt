   December 16, 2012

   The Honorable Hillary Rodham Clinton
   U.S. Department of State
   2201 C Street NW
   Washington, DC 20520

   Dear Secretary Clinton,

   On the heels of the recent Global Zero Summits in London and Los Angeles, Global Zero will bring
   together hundreds of outstanding students from around the world for a special Global Zero event at Yale
   University in New Haven, Connecticut, February 18-19, 2012. We are very pleased to invite you to
   deliver an address at the Global Zero Student Summit, which will serve as a springboard for a new group
   of Global Zero student leaders and will mark the launch of Global Zero's 2012 campaign.

    Convening for two days, these young Global Zero leaders will participate in intensive policy and
    campaign training and strategize on building the movement. The program, hosted in partnership with
    President Ernesto Zedillo and the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization, will include sessions with
    eminent leaders and experts on key steps to initiating the first in history multilateral nuclear arms
    negotiations; the $1 trillion per decade cost of nuclear weapons globally; reduction of U.S. and Russian
    tactical nuclear weapons in the European theater; nuclear weapons issues in the context of presidential
    elections in the U.S., France and Russia; and movement building and civic engagement in the 20
    century.

    As you know, Global Zero student leaders are an increasingly powerful force in the Global Zero
    movement. Your presence and remarks would inspire these students to new heights of leadership,
    commitment and creativity — essential fuel for the campaign — and we would be honored by your
    participation.

    The Global Zero Student Summit at Yale will begin at 9:00 a.m. on Saturday, February 18th and conclude
    at 2:00 p.m. on Sunday, February 19th.

    Thank you for giving this your consideration.

    Sincerely,




    Bruce Blair
