Subject: AW: our interview

Dear Anne-Marie,

for the printed version, which appeared in DIE WELT this Monday, we unfortunately had to cut the interview quite a bit:

http://www.welt.de/print/die welt/politik/article106411170/Hillary-Clinton-ist-brillant-und-denkt-global.html

However, I have published it in full length and with a much more detailed introduction in my weblog:

http://freie.welt.de/2012/06/04/hillarv-clintons-chefdenkerin-nato-wird-qlobal/

All the best, and looking forward to hopefully see you again,

Richard

Betreff: our interview

Dear Richard,
Thanks very much for sending me the translated version of the interview. I think it came out very well and am delighted
we had a chance to do it, even if it had to be shorter than might have been ideal. Attached is a version with a very few
changes in red (in English, I'm afraid). If you can make those, I am delighted to have it published.
Best,
Anne-Marie
