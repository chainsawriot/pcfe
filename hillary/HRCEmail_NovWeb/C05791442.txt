Hi Cheryl.

I know we did not see each other this week.

I want to let you know and it is in the weekly S Note that I leave today for Russia.

I will be arriving Sunday to begin my U.S.-Russian Federation SubNational Engagement Visit. I will be visiting Oblasts
across Russia: from Moscow to Vladivostok.

Phil, the EUR Team, Russia Desk and Amb. McFaul and the CGs teams in the Consulates have already provided excellent
support to the formation of my agenda and the visit.
I understand I will be meet with DCM Gwaltney and the Embassy team on 23rd July, and I look forward to discussing
engaging Russian central government and local officials and to hearing about the ways that this type of engagement can
be beneficial to all of our efforts.

Let S know the Russians are totally supported of MFA Minister's direct request to her re the launch of this effort.
I will keep you posted.

Have a great weekend.

Need to meet when I return.

Thanks for your help and counsel.

Reta Jo
