                           Drawdown of Private Security Contractors:
                                 Impact on USAID Programs

     To comply with the decree to disband Private Security Contractors, $1.5 billion in U.S.
     mission-critical programs begin demobilizing on or before November 3rd. To
     include:

     •   Stabilization.

            o The $350 million Local Government and Community Development (LGCD)
              program began initial shut down operations in mid-October (see
              demobilization timeline below).

            o Nation-wide roughly 329 unfinished projects will be canceled, valued at
              approximately $21 million dollars.

             o This is a critical program for Operation Hamkari.

     •   Roads:

             o Expect loss of over 18,000 Afghan jobs with shut-down of major road
               projects.

             o $495 million in additional road construction contracts across the country via
               Louis Berger/Black & Veatch will be terminated and the contractor begins
               demobilization by Nov. 1.

             o In several incidents, registered private security contractors for major road
               projects have already been disarmed and disbanded by the MO!.

     •   Agriculture:

             o Visas renewals for international security personnel for the major wheat-seed
               distribution program, AVIPA were refused by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
               as a result of the decree.

             o If security cannot be extended into all the AVIPA distribution areas, there will
               be a major disruption of operations, and unacceptable delays in getting seed
               and fertilizer to 260,000 farmers.

     •   Energy:

             o The Kabul Electricity Program connecting 70,000 customers to the electrical
               grid, will begin demobilization by November 1 of activities that require
               mobility.
