Marc,

A relatively calm meeting with HRK this afternoon. We'll have a cable tomorrow.
                                                                                                                B1
                                                                                                                1.4(B)
    •    I raised Afridi again, same talking points as I used with her before.                                  1.4(D)
    •    I got the impression she believes agreement is near on GLOCs, wants to see a deal.
    •




           Pakimil talks. And as for apology ....
    •    She was not defensive, but emphasized that the Pakistani leadership has been restrained since Chicago, even as
         (she claimed) the U.S. leadership has not.
    •    I said: make no mistake. Everyone/everyone in Washington has had it up to here in Pakistan, whether because
         of GLOCs, HQN, Afridi, you name it. I said: it's very/rpt/very bad in Washington. She said: I know. I said: I
         don't think you do. Talk to Sherry.
    •    At the end of the meeting, I hit her with DS visas and with the Amcit incarcerated in Peshawar.

Cameron
