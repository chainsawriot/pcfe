I will write at greater length this weekend on substance, which is what matters here. But thanks very much for reacting
so fast and for trying to call; that meant a great deal. And take a long walk in the beautiful autumn woods this weekend!
No need to respond; I fully understand if you do not want to put anything in email.
Best,
Anne-Marie
