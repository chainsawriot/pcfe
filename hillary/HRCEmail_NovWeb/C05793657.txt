Madam Secretary,

Hope you and your family have a happy holiday, and hope you're feeling better. It was nice to see John Kerry get
announced, but he has a very tough act to follow. You've built a very special and enduring place in this institution, and
around the world.

And it'll be nice to spend Christmas without Dana Rohrabacher and Dan Burton rolling their eyes at me ....

Warm regards,

Bill
