Kerry got Lugar to agree to put it on the business meeting agenda tomorrow â€” which, of course, doesn't mean it will
pass or not be held over. Still, it's a positive development and means we have a shot....

See below from Senator Kerry. He is meeting with Lugar at noon to try and work it out.
Any day that the Secretary feels frustrated by the Department, she should just remember that it could be worse: she
could still be in the Senate.

David: I'm not a problem in getting it on but we need do get the GOP to sign off because it's within the seven days notice
and they're playing hardball. Has nothing to do with staff of HRC calling. We're trying to deal with a small group of very
difficult people who don't do reasonable and easy things easily. We're trying and I am personally involved
