                 Why does Hillary Clinton appear so capable at Senate hearing? Because she knows her
                 brief and the issues better than anyone in the room.

            1.   Daniel Drezner Pdandrezner

                 Conspiracy-mongers are gonna go nuts after Clinton's testimony today. For someone with
                 serious health scares last month, she looks fabulous.

                 Shorter Hillary Clinton: "You can't handle the truth!"

            1.   Market Bull pMarket Bull

                 Nobody puts Hillary in a corner.

            1. David Rothkopf @dirothkopf

                 Hillary Clinton is doing magnificently in the Benghazi hearing. Strong, clear, focused on
                 solutions. She will be missed.

           Toughest exchange in hearing w/ Wisconson GOP Sen Johnson over talking pts Clinton
           not taking any guff from these guys #mitchellreports

      1.   Josh Rogin @ioshrogin


           Subtext of Clinton shouting at Sen. Johnson: There's nothing you can do to me now, so
           I'm not taking any more of your shit.

      1.   Josh Rogin Pjoshrogin


           "What difference at this point does it make?!" whether there was a protest. Clinton yells
           at Ron Johnson. Damn.

      1.   Laura Seay ptexasinafrica


           I'm a little in awe.
