Huma and Ted: To close the circle on this issue, I spoke to President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and the Liberian Perm Rep
yesterday afternoon (9/26). President Sirleaf wanted to alert us that an American citizen had been engaged in suspicious
activities and would not be allowed to leave Liberia until a police investigation is completed. President Sirleaf asked that
we not interfere in the Liberian legal process. I told assured President Sirleaf I would contact our embassy (which I did)
and that we would not do anything that undermined Liberia's investigation/legal system. The embassy believes that the
liberians are handling this case appropriately and we have informed the Liberians we do not intend to interfere will their
proceedings. Johnnie

Importance: High

The Liberian PR called our offices this morning with an urgent message. I tried calling the PR to get the topic, but just
went to voicemail. I thought I should pass the message now and Eric or I can keep trying to reach the PR to get the topic
if you want us to do that.

Thank you,
