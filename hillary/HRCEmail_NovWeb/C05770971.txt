The Secretary's Call Sheet for
Indian Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee

Purpose of Call:
                                                                                                                                 B5



Points to Raise:




Background: It was reported in India Friday that a Parliamentary Standing Committee report sent to the Indian cabinet
was amended in a manner that effectively created -- by removing the word "and" between two sensitive clauses (17 (a)
and (b)) -- an additional, non-contractual path to liability, rendering the draft bill CSC non-compliant. The importance to
industry, both American and international, of this three-letter word cannot be overstated. GE and Westinghouse have           1.4(D)
told us they will not enter the Indian market if the bill is not CSC-compliant.                                               B1

                  The recommendations of the standing committee report are being drafted into the bill, a copy of
which we have not yet received. (The bill should be tabled in parliament on Wednesday, August 25.)

                                                                                                                  1.4(D)
                                                                                                                  B1
