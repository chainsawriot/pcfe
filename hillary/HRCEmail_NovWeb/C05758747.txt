Cheryl,




Great meeting you yesterday. I enjoyed the conversation and am looking forward very much to working with you. The
security interview went fine, I believe. I owe them some more information which they will get over the weekend.




Separately I have attached a bio for                    as promised.




Talk to you soon. Thanks again,




Best wishes,
