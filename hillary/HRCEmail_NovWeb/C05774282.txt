This is all coming to S from SRAP along with specific talking points. I am only sending this to you because sometimes not
everything makes it all the way through that system. So if the Secretary sees what comes in and wants the "list she
asked for" that is attached above but I am pretty sure it will come attached to the talking points from Vikram.

Please find attached a copy of the detailed information that the Secretary asked the Administrator to provide. I have also
inserted herein proposed "transition" narrative, modifying slightly what Vikram produced to address our needs.

Just let me/us know if you have any questions, comments, revisions, etc.

Thanks,

Michele
