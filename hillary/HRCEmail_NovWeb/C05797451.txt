Subject: RE: Added protection

We've otten the extra protection - - twenty â€”seven police currently deployed around Embassy compound,
            Senior police contact reports that an additional 300 police are on standby at nearby police compound,
approx. 8 minute response time, according to RSO. RSO believes added police protection is adequate under present
(calm) circumstances.

                                                                                                              B7(F)
