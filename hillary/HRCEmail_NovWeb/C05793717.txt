Subject:                          Thoughts and prayers



Boss - I'm not sure if they've tried to wrest your blackberry away from you (or if I'm encouraging bad behavior by writing
you!), but I wanted to let you know you're in my thoughts and prayers.
And more important, that I'm trying to push forward on all fronts - we're delivering points to HBJ's guy tonight; we
talked to JK's friend today and are trying to get a meeting set up soon; and I want to get the Somali president here so
you can announce recognition. Etc. Etc. Because I have faith you'll be back very soon and I want to deliver for you.

Take care of yourself,
Jake
