Not really odd since no other P5+1 country is affected. She told me and I told her not to worry.

Subject: Summit of the Americas and Iran Talks

Cheryl,

As you know, I had planned to attend the Summit of the Americas April 14-16 in Cartegena. It now appears that Helga
Schmid, the EU political director, having looked at Cathy Ashton's schedule and pulsed other political directors
schedules, would now like to offer the Iranians either April 13-14, 14-15 or 15-16. Those talks will likely be in Oslo or
Vienna. Checking flight schedules, it is virtually impossible to do both. I assume that given the Secretary's participation
in the Summit along with Roberta, Carmen, John Feeley and Ambassador McKinley, that the Secretary would approve
my releasing the dates to Helga to schedule talks during that time with my attendance. I very much wish I could be in
two places at one time but Star Trek is still only a television show. Please let me know as soon as possible whether my
assumption is correct. Helga hopes to get back to her counterpart as soon as possible. Thanks you.

Wendy
