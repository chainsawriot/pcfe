Just prior to your speech in Dakar, you will meet (in a receiving line) with Binta Diop and a few women from the
women's campaign initiative. They have been recognized as having played a very crucial role in the outcome a peaceful
outcome to the election (at a time when chaos could have ruled the day). Just after he was elected, the President went
out of his way to thank the women for the role they played (they had established a Situation Room and excellent
grassroots operation) in enabling a peaceful transfer of power. Binta is the head of Femmes en Solidarite. She is well
known globally, and you may have met her over the years. She is a huge fan of yours. The Senagalese women's efforts
are now being recognized as a model that could be replicated for elections in other African countries.

On another note, Binta told me that Zuma has recently reached out to her and is also consulting with Sirleaf, Banda, etc,
on ways the AU can better incorporate women into its work and address some of the key challenges in Africa. I think you
are tentatively meeting with Zuma.
