Cheryl, Scott is traveling between NJ and Indiana today and is reachable by phone

These are two different groups of people. The first group he emailed to you and Pat at 10:37 pm are regarding his

Just confirming scott - you are emailing the Secretary at 11:17pm about the folks you emailed Pat and me about at
10:37pm and said:

"Cheryl and Pat, after months of work, I understand that you have one of our Schedule B appointments on your desk for
approval                                                          . I have two additional Schedule B appointments
pending L and M clearances that I hope will reach your office in the coming week for approval
                                                                                  These three individuals will complete the
hires we'd planned for our Washington team. I would sincerely appreciate your assistance to bring these key players on
board. With best wishes, Scott"

Or are these diff folks you raising with the Secretary?

Secretary Clinton, over the past five months, we've been in close contact with Pat Kennedy and Cheryl Mills to
hire additional people in the field using available supplemental funding from Congress. We have reached a
critical period now as we try to get civil society and rebel groups to the Doha peace talks and we continue our
work on implementing the CPA milestones. Shuttle engagement can't do this job effectively and the Embassy
is not resourced to do this mission; therefore, I need your support for two additional senior staff members in
Sudan. These two individuals will focus on building relations with Darfuris and supporting the peace-building
process in Darfur, in addition to implementing CPA agreements in the South. They will work under Chief of
Mission authority when they are in country, and will coordinate closely with the Embassy in Khartoum and the
Consulate in Juba.

The next six months are extremely critical as we prepare for the upcoming Doha negotiations and try to
prevent renewal of North-South conflict. I'm convinced that we must immediately place staff in Darfur and
Juba/Khartoum with relevant technical skills to augment embassy staff. I regret that I've had to raise this issue
to your level, but I strongly believe we face an increasing risk of failure if we don't get the requisite full-time
presence on the ground in Sudan as soon as possible. I'm available to discuss this matter with you by phone
anytime before I depart for Moscow on Sunday. Very respectfully, Scott
