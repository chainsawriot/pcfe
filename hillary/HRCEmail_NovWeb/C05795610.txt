Cheryl: Thanks for checking in. Outstanding first week thus far. Quite grueling, but everything has been very helpful for
our Burma policy. (think we made the right call in providing her with support - the crush of interest in her is stunning
and really requires our guidance and gentle shepherding to navigate. By the way, she is very grateful for all that S did
with and for her. She feels bad that she left the Oval without a chance to give S a proper goodbye and thank you.

DS and Shelpa are outstanding. Regards -

Patrick

Subject: ASSK and media

Team:

ASSK did Christiane Amanpour (CNN), Ann Curry (NBC), and Charlie Rose (PBS) this morning here in New York. Broad
coverage today/tonight expected. Likely highlights:

--Support easing of sanctions. Lifting will come later, but it will come. Appreciate what sanctions have done (political
not economic impact), but it's time to give our people a chance. Need transparency and accountability. Need
democracy- and human right-friendly investment.

--Sanctions did not hurt the people, it was economic mismanagement. IMF says the same.

--Won't reveal what I discussed with POTUS (didn't address sanctions with him, rather with Congress), but he did
introduce me to his dog, Bo.

--I like the generals, it wasn't personal. My father was a general; I know and respect the Army.

--Rohingya - need to speak about their situation but not provoke more problems. All in Rakhine are poor and need help,
not just one population.

--Burma or Myanmar. A matter of personal choice and a question of freedom of expression.

--I have what I hope are good relations with President Thein Sein.

--Burma shouldn't be a point of contention between the U.S. And China, but rather an opportunity.

--Plenty of personal points on house arrest, sacrifice, family, sons, husband, etc.

Regards. Press event with UNSYG next.

Patrick
