Subject: Cairo outcomes

Apologies for spamming you with email - I just discovered that most of my emails weren't going out and I was not
receiving many of the messages sent to me. Below is a comprehensive summary of the outcomes on Syria. You've seen
my separate emails on Abu Mazen.

The Council meeting concluded with the adoption — by consensus — of a new resolution. Embassy Cairo's unofficial
translation is attached. The key elements are as follows:

    Emphasized need to immediately and fully stop all acts of violence and the murder of Syrian civilians. Ask the
UNSC to issue a resolution in this regard.

    Ask the Syrian armed forces to immediately lift the military siege imposed on residential districts and villages, and
assume their responsibility to protect civilians.

     Emphasize the commitment to full implementation of all Arab League Council resolutions.

      End all forms of diplomatic cooperation with the representatives of the Syrian regime in countries, agencies and
international conferences. Ask all countries that care for the lives of the Syrian people to follow the Arab lead.

      The use of violence against Syrian civilians with this extreme cruelty, including the targeting of women and
children, lies under the jurisdiction of the international criminal law and requires the punishment of its perpetrators.

     Emphasize the validity of the economic boycott procedures and the ending commercial dealings with the Syrian
regime, except for those that directly affect Syrian citizens, according to AL resolutions.

     End the mission of the Arab League Monitors Delegation.

      Ask the UNSC to issue a resolution to form a joint Arab-UN peace keeping force to supervise the implementation of
the ceasefire.


     Demand the Arab group in the UN present a draft resolution to the UNGA as soon as possible that includes the
Arab initiative and other AL resolutions.

     Demand the AL SYG name a special envoy to follow the proposed political process outlined in the AL's January 22
resolution.


      Welcome the call of the Tunisian Republic to host the Friends of Syria conference scheduled for 24 February 2012.

       Open channels of communication with the Syrian opposition and provide all the kinds of political and financial
support for them, and ask them to unify their lines and enter into a serious dialogue that preserves their cohesion and
efficiency before the Tunisia conference is held.

      Open the way for Arab and international relief organizations to allow humanitarian relief material to reach afflicted
citizens and counter the deteriorating humanitarian situation. In the case of the obstruction of food and medicine from
reaching Syrian civilians, the Arab League asks the UNSC to assume its responsibility.

     Call for popular donation campaigns to be organized to help the brother Syrian people and reduce their suffering.

     Establish an Arab international mechanism to offer support and humanitarian assistance for the brother Syrian
people.

     Ask the Organization of the Islamic Conference to support the international effort regarding Syria, and assume its
responsibilities in this regard.
