Team:

ASSK did Christiane Amanpour (CNN), Ann Curry (NBC), and Charlie Rose
(PBS) this morning here in New York. Broad coverage today/tonight expected. Likely highlights:

--Support easing of sanctions. Lifting will come later, but it will come. Appreciate what sanctions have done (political
not economic impact), but it's time to give our people a chance. Need transparency and accountability. Need
democracy- and human right-friendly investment.

--Sanctions did not hurt the people, it was economic mismanagement. IMF says the same.

--Won't reveal what I discussed with POTUS (didn't address sanctions with him, rather with Congress), but he did
introduce me to his dog, Bo.

--I like the generals, it wasn't personal. My father was a general; I know and respect the Army.

--Rohingya - need to speak about their situation but not provoke more problems. All in Rakhine are poor and need help,
not just one population.

--Burma or Myanmar. A matter of personal choice and a question of freedom of expression.

--I have what I hope are good relations with President Thein Sein.

--Burma shouldn't be a point of contention between the U.S. And China, but rather an opportunity.

--Plenty of personal points on house arrest, sacrifice, family, sons, husband, etc.

Regards. Press event with UNSYG next.
