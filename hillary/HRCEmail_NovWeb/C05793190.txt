Dear Cheryl,

On the way to my office today I was thrilled to read Dan's email about his meeting with the Secretary.
All of our family are so grateful to you for arranging this. Something about kindness to a grandchild that is very special
to a grandparent :-)

Please do thank the Secretary for taking the time to talk with Dan.

I hope to see you sometime soon.

All the best for the holiday and the New Year

Jim
