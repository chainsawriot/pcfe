Subject: Bloomberg headlines pushing markets lower

    •    U.S. stocks declined after German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the new Greek government should not be
         granted additional leeway on the terms of its bailout and Spanish bond yields advanced to a euro-era record.
    •    American exporters from Dow Chemical to Hewlett-Packard Co. are preparing for a further decline in demand
         from Europe as the region's deepening debt crisis threatens to derail a source of strength for the U.S. Economy.
    •    Greece's two traditional political rivals are in a race to forge a coalition as the state's cash dwindles, bank
         deposits flee and Europe demands renewed austerity pledges before releasing more emergency aid.
    •    The euro erased an initial advance, stocks fell and borrowing costs in Spain and Italy surged on concern an
         election win by Greece's biggest pro-bailout party would provide only a brief respite from Europe's financial
         crisis.
