Cheryl,

Thanks for your e-mail. The combination of Maria's and my travel schedules plus scheduling calls with the candidates,
who also have busy schedules, has caused this to go slowly. We should have 3 top candidates by early October. It is
unlikely that we will get anyone physically into the job until Jan/Feb 2011 - as the top candidates are currently in
academic roles.

FYI- I have gotten positive feedback from some in the science community regarding our process and consultation with the
science societies to identify candidates.

Best Regards,
Kern-Ann

I am fine with the response but can I ask - why is this taking so long?

I b/I it does hurt our credibility on imp of this role that we do not have a final list of 3 candidates to decide from.

Fine for me, but I would add one sentence at end saying we plan to complete phone interviews in early October and will
proceed with face to face interviews of the final candidates before making the selection.
Thanks,
Maria

FYI â€” Once again Senator Bingaman's staff has asked for an update on our process for identifying the next Science
Adviser. I suggest we have H send the following response. Please let me know if this works for you.


Thanks.
Kern-Ann



We are currently conducting phone interviews with candidates for the position of Science Adviser. These candidates
were identified through a consultative process with several science organizations and societies, including the National
Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the
American Chemical Society and the American Physical Society. This consultation resulted in a long list of candidates
which we subsequently reviewed with the science organizations and societies. Based on the current round of
interviews, we anticipate developing a shorter list of candidates for interviews in Washington.
