Latest report:

Amb. Patterson spoke with President Zardari on this issue and he expressed concern that people in Pakistan will not
believe that this was anything but an intentional leak by the usg. He said nobody will believe that someone was able to
get this volume of info from a secure usg system.

Not surprising.
