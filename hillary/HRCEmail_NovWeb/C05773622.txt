Dear all - see below.
I will probably call Dr B on Tuesday .
We may want to talk at some stage and compare notes after Moscow. But I hope to see my EU 3 colleagues in
Lux on Monday? I will be in Vienna on Tuesday (OSCE annual security conference but also IAEA) and then
go to Brazil for my PD dialogue (which I already cancelled once because of Iran )
Best Helga

        Helga,

        So far unconfirmed by IRI Gov, but the two together do not point to the right direction....

                 Iran to suspend nuclear talks until sanctions are
                 lifted: website
                 June 21 â€” An Iranian website close to moderate circles of the ruling
                 establishment in Iran suggests suspending negotiations with the major
                 world powers over country's nuclear program until the sanctions are
                 lifted.

                 The website baztab.net which for its critical stance against the Iranian
                 President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is filtered, suggests that the West

          would continue talks with Iran to the very end and would use it to
          "persuade the public opinion of its peaceful intentions, saying it has been
          trying to settle its dispute with Iran through diplomatic ways however it
          remained no other alternative but attacking Iran."

          Baztab believes there would be no benefit to Iran to negotiate but also
          suffer from sanctions, "especially when it is also downgraded to experts'
          meeting."

          "We have to change the game," proposes the website adding: "Iran has
          to tell 5+1 and Catherine Ashton that in case of implementation of the
          sanctions against the central bank and seizing of oil purchase by EU,
          talks would be suspended."

          On June 28, the US will instate sanctions on companies working with
          Iran's central bank; days later, on July 1, the European Union will launch
          an embargo on Iranian oil, which could knock out a third of the country's
          revenue./-

   Rafsanjani attacks world powers' dishonesty'

   Jun 20 - The former Iranian president has criticized world powers for their "bullying"
   and "dishonesty" in recent nuclear talks in Moscow, newspapers reported on Thursday.
   The comments suggest that Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and his allies, who support the
   broad lines of Iran's controversial nuclear program but are more open to compromise
   with the West than hardliners, are also frustrated by the lack of progress in negotiations.
   "The talks proved that the Western side is (not interested) in interaction and they are
   not honest. They have based their policy on bullying alone," Rafsanjani was quoted by
   several Iranian dailies as telling a group of clerics. He also urged Iranian unity to thwart
   its enemies./-
