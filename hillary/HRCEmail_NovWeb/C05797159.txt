.... as oneof the 5.6 billion well-wishers as you get rid of what's ailing you (and I use that number only cuz the
other 1.4 haven't gotten the word). Anyway, I've had both conditions you're recovering from, but not
simultaneously, and I can only imagine how miserable it's been. At least you're spared the Benghazi Follies on
the Hill. Take care, let yourself be taken care of, and above all, take it easyâ€”God knows you deserve that,
without the maladies. Strobe
