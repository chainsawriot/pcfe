Can Bill get Preval or Belerive to "address" nation or go out w him. Preval's absence in person or on radio is starting to
be big problem.

Yes to more food sites - he says 14 - unclear if same 14 that wfp had made into 4.

Ken keen is sending troops to hospital for 5 days and then doing an assessment.

Don't know re hospitals and our folks - our hhs folks never showed up at general hospital yesterday so trying to fig that
out.

Questions arising from press reports:



  Why can Israel set up a full field hospital w operating rooms and the US military can't/won't and only offers surgery on
the Carl Vinson which has to fly patients over and even flew Sanjay Gupta there to do an operation since they did not
have a neurosurgeon?


  If we are going to start air drops of food from C-130s as Jim Jones advocates, do we have Haitians on the radio
explaining that's what we're doing and asking that people proceed calmly because a lot of meals will be dropped every
night?

  Have the Haitians agreed to more food sites yet?
Are our troops starting to provide more security at food and medical sites? Will they stay at Paul's hospital overnight?
