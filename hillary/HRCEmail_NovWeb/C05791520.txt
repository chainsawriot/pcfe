Subject: Syrian Oppsition Meeting in Cairo: Agreement on composition

From our team in Cairo at the Opposition meeting, final session:

After about five hours the group agreed on a composition of the "follow up and communications committee." They will
propose to their political bodies that it be a 21-person committee with three seats for the SNC; 2 seats for the KNC; and
one seat for the other 16 groups.

This odd formulation was a result of the SNC's need to be perceived as the heavy weight and the Kurdish demand that it
have more seats than the Turkmen. Despite getting their wish, the Kurds attempted (right before the vote) to add
another seat in their umbrella which angered every participant in the room. Finally, after an Amb Ford scolding, they
conceded.

Three people were selected to collect the names from each of the 18 groups.
They are scheduled to submit the names of each group's participants to the Arab League in seven days.
