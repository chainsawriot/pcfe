STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON

Resignation of Kofi Annan as Joint Special Envoy for Syria

Earlier today, I spoke with Kofi Annan and thanked him on behalf of the United States for his service as the UN-Arab
League Joint Special Envoy for Syria. Five months ago, he took on the heavy task of trying to bring an end to the killing
of civilians in Syria and to forge a path toward a peaceful political transition and an inclusive, democratic post-Assad
Syria. He worked tirelessly to try to build consensus in the international community, end the bloodshed, and usher in a
government that would meet the legitimate, democratic aspirations of the Syrian people. Unfortunately, the Security
Council was blocked from giving him key tools to advance his efforts.

I wish Kofi Annan well in his future endeavors. To the Syrian people: the United States continues to stand with you and
we remain committed to an effective and swift political transition as envisioned under the Annan framework.
