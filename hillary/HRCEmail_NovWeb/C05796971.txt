Well, what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger (as I have rationalized for years), so just survive and you'll have
triumphed!

Dear Bill and Tom,

I'm sorry that I cannot be on the Hill today as we had long planned, but very grateful that you both will be. The
Department and I appreciate your leadership everyday.

So, I'll be nursing my cracked head and cheering you on as you "remain calm and carry on"!

Happy Holidays---H
