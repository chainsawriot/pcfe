Remember those great 4th of July parades in Park Ridge that ended w popsicles in the park near Thompson's. Does
anybody do that anymore?




Now heading back to DC to watch fireworks from the terrace on the 8th floor of the State Dept w about 350 foreign
ambassadors and people from State. My last time to do it so I figured I should. Capricia is in full 4th of July mode so no
telling what will happen!

And, please, enough w the Sox. Tom is bad enough, but I can't believe he's enlisted you

Well, Sara Paretsky, the new Sox fan, can be excited: we took two out of four from the Yankees IN the
Bronx. Quite a weekend. (and tell Jake, his Twinkies are sorta okay). Speaking of NY, are you there for the
4th? Going to march in the Chappaqua parade?

Chicago mystery writer Sara Paretsky is a longtime Cubs fan, but now, "I'm gone, I'm done, I'm
throwing away my Cubs caps and warm-up jacket, I'm staying away from Wrigley." Why? Because of
Joe Ricketts. "It gives chutzpah a new definition to back a campaign against the president of the
United States because you hate even the small safety net we have, and then, as patriarch of the
billionaire family that owns the Cubs, ask us for $300 million to rebuild Wrigley," the author says

Sara Paretsky: Why I'm done with the Cubs




By: Sara Paretsky June 19, 2012
It's over. Joe Ricketts, you've done for me what 45 years of losing never could. You've broken my Cubs addiction.
It began with hot Kansas days, looking for a baseball in a field of corn. In May, the shiny green stalks are already higher
than the heads of everyone but the centerfielder. Once again, Sara Paretsky, on the corner, has hurled the ball past the
first baseman's head and into the field beyond. Two runs score, and Wakarusa handily beats Kaw Valley. Everyone in the
Kansas River Valley in 1960 knows it will be a long season.
When Rafael Dolls loaded the bases on May 26 this year and then hit a batter to bring in the run that gave the Cubs their
11th loss in a row, I had a little empathy. Not a lot, but some.
When I was 12 and 13, I played third base for our two-room country school. I had a strong arm for a kid; my cousin David
didn't want me "throwing like a girl," and he taught me well. I could get the ball from third to first, but David hadn't been
able to teach me to aim. Kaw Valley had the losingest record in our rural league.
I am inured to losing. When the Kansas City A's arrived in 1955, we became fans, my brothers, my father and I. Who else
was there to root for? St. Louis?
The A's were beyond abominable. In 1956, they finished 52-104, but worse than that, they acted as the Yankees farm
club, giving away Roger Mans and Bobby Schantz, among others.
When I moved to Chicago in 1966, I was primed to become a Cubs fan.
I hunkered down. I let my hopes soar in '69, only to die. I lived, I died, I lived, I died. I had the chance to watch Fergie
Jenkins and Billy Williams and Ron Santo. VI Warshawski's reporter friend, Murray Ryerson, is described in his first
appearance as looking like Rick Sutcliffe.
I still have a signed photo of Bill Buckner on my desk. I don't care about his'86 World Series error. He played in a lot of
pain, took an hour to prep his legs before games, had some great stats, and (true story) carried out the garbage and
shoveled walks for his elderly next door neighbor who only learned from me that he was a sports star.
1984 was my nadir. I actually let them break my heart. I was working for CNA Insurance in downtown Chicago. All up and
down the building's 44 floors, we sat with our desk drawers open, heads cocked, listening to radios while pretending to
develop marketing plans. Leon Durham's Kool-Aid-filled glove â€” now that I don't forgive.
After 1984 I dialed back a little, but I stayed with the team. I joked that it was better to be a Cubs fan than a Yankees fan
because great art is built on suffering.
In 2003, I was on a book tour and went into my event with the Cubs poised to clinch the NLCS in Game 6 against the
Marlins. I came out just in time for Bartman. I knew then that the Cubs would lose heart and lose the series, but I came
back to them the next year and stayed . . . until now.
I know Major League Baseball owners are in the 1 percent. Maybe most of them agree with Joe Ricketts, that tax dollars
shouldn't be used to weave a safety net for the rest of us. But it gives chutzpah a new definition to back a campaign
against the president of the United States because you hate even the small safety net we have, and then, as patriarch of
the billionaire family that owns the Cubs, ask us for $300 million to rebuild Wrigley.
I'm gone, I'm done, I'm throwing away my Cubs caps and warm-up jacket, I'm staying away from Wrigley. You don't get
one more thin dime from me, Joe Ricketts. I'm supporting my own adult children who've been out of work for two years in
this economy; you take care of yours.
Sara Paretsky is the creator of private eye and basketball player VI Warshawski; her most recent novel is "Breakdown." This essay
was produced by and also appears on ChicaqoSideSports.com.
