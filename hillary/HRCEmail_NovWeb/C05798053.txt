Cheryl:
It has been an honor and a privilege to work at State at the same time as you and the
Secretary. You have been a model and a joy to work with. Eduardo Bahtia and Julissa are right to
rave about you, I do now as well!

Thank you for all your support, it was crucial during my confirmation fight. It simply would have been
impossible without yours and the Secretary's support!

I saw the hearings this week, and think the Secretary was masterful. Please know that if in the future
there are times when support is needed, I will be there. In the meantime, I know your family will be
very happy to enjoy and see a great deal more of you!!!!

Warmly,
Mari Carmen Aponte
