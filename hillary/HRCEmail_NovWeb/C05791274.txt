Subject: US Jewish leaders criticize West Bank report (AP)

JERUSALEM (AP) - Dozens of American Jewish leaders have appealed to Benjamin Netanyahu, asking that
his government reject a recent report claiming Israel is not occupying the West Bank.
   In a letter to the Israeli prime minister, they predict the report could jeopardize prospects for peace with the
Palestinians and tarnish Israel's image. The letter was obtained Monday by The Associated Press.
   Signatories included businessmen and philanthropists Charles Bronfman and Stanley Gold; the former head
of the Israel lobby in Washington, Tom Dine, and former Jewish Agency board chairman Richard Pearlstone.
   The signatories wrote they fear the report will "add fuel to those who seek to delegitimize Israel's right to
exist."
   The Israeli report by former Supreme Court Justice Edmond Levy says Israel has a legal right to build
settlements.
