Subject: Miscellaneous items for S mtg w/Thein Sein

All: Just finished mtg   Soe Thane. He outlined three items TS intends to raise during the mtg this afternoon (may be
more but these were three he spotlighted from notes).

One concerns desire for a Fulbright School in Burma akin to what has been established in Vietnam (Saigon) that trains
govt officials. It's USG funded and organized in collaboration w/Harvard. I don't know much about it but perhaps other
SEA hands do?

TS may also request support for World Bank/ADB infrastructure loans.
                                 Likely appropriate timing for discussion/support given expected WB/ADB arrears
clearance by end of year.



                               They want to know exactly what we want them to do here. I said we can have that mtg
in DC when they're in town early next week.
                                                                                                            1.4(B)
