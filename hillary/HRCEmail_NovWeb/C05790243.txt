Dear Hillary,
I hope this finds you well and less exhausted, but I doubt the latter, knowing the pace you are keeping. I am writing to
introduce you to our dear friend, Kirk Ellis, the writer of the John Adams PBS series, whom you will meet on May 24' at
the Fine Arts Committee meeting on the 8th floor. He is brilliant, witty, entertaining, a true Renaissance man He is a
leader in the rich cultural and art world here in Santa Fe and a genuinely nice person.
                 I know that you will enjoy his company, however briefly your paths cross.

Valerie joins me in wishing you all the best.

Joe
