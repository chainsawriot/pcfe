I siad I thought it was a good idea but needed to be looked in the context of the other institutions. But was led to
believe at our meeting that Melanne was in charge of this and that she should be brought into the fold but what she was
doing was on its own track. And she suggested to me that everyone knew she had been working on this for a long time
and was the decisionmaker.
