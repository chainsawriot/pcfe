Good Morning Madam Secretary:

Per your request, I am working on locking in calls to Ambassadors Patterson and Crocker on Sunday morning.

They are currently scheduled as follows:

8:00am - Ambassador Crocker
8:30am - Ambassador Patterson

Does this work for you? Both are available in the 8am-11am window.

-Rob
