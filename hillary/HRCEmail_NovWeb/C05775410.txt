Good. We'll need to use this to get the UAE to match the number and the other Gulfies to contribute as well.

Excellent news if true. I heard the P's were very happy with the meeting and got a commitment that the SAG would give

We'll run some traps here.

See below from our Charge in Riyadh: good news if Saudis come up with 100 mil on top of the 60 mil (I believe) they've
sent so far this year to the PA.
