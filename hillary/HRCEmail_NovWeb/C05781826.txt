Bill called me Friday evening: he said Scowcroft called him to say that he had heard of hold on his nom. Scowcroft
informed that he had shared this with GHW Bush, who had already called Senator to argue to release. Scowcroft could
call, as might others (Armitage, Baker). Secretary Rice is also informed of the hold and can call.

Bill, who departs for Middle East today, wrote me yesterday re: Rice call, that his sense would be sooner the better -- on
grounds of need to fill position, not getting into Taiwan stuff. Also recognizes that this timing is up to us.

I can tee up Rice call when we're ready to launch. Rice and HRC will see each other in Budapest later this week.
