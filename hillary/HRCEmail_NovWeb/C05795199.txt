Have you seen the memo from Eric Goosby about speaking opportunities at the AIDS Conference this summer? We
should discuss.


Have you discussed internally the idea of taking business delegations to Cambodia, Korea and Vietnam as Kurt
suggested?


Do we have dates for the Diplomacy Center events from Elizabeth Bagley?


Pls be sure I offer a video or a letter for                   birthday party.

On March 23         is having a birthday party fo    at the Willard Hotel and begged me to come by. I told her I had to
go to Saudi Arabia but now I'm not. So I don't know what time it is but would be willing to stop by if you think it is
important. What do you think?


I told Marcia Dyson I would see her so pis add her to list.

Do we have a date for the UAE women's event?
