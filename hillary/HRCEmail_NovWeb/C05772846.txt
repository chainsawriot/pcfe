Jake-- couple of things--



Have been thinking of writing S an e-mail urging her to weigh-in asap on getting Cuba regs out. Sooner the better.
Though out of my lane-- having been getting calls from Cuban American dems worried that administration will trade off
inaction on regs with House reps in exchange for other administration equities. Thoughts??

Heading to Paraguay and Uruguay-- back Thursday. Best, Arturo
