FYI. I was wrong. This meeting was in fact in Geneva.

Further to the meeting of the P 5 with India and Pakistan in Geneva on Monday, June 10: please let S know prior to her
meeting with her Indian counterpart. Thanks.




We ended with a discussion of next steps, and I suggested several options for a next meeting, including on the margins
of the ATT negotiations in NYC in July, in July-August in Geneva, or in early September as we begin to gather for the

UNGA. All agreed that a next meeting should be pursued, although Akram did say that he would have to check back
with Islamabad about his attendance.
Most commented that July in NY would be good timing, so we will pursue that as a first priority.

Overall the environment of the meeting was very good, and discussion was cordial. There was no sign of bilateral
tension between India and Pakistan. Akram and Mehta interacted in a friendly manner.
It was a good start to a process that we hope will become established this summer.

We've had a scrap of good news here in Geneva: our P5+ meeting with the Indians and Pakistanis went well yesterday.
We have bee trying to get this group together since last July, to discuss where we go from here on moving forward a
Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty process. The discussion yesterday was serious and all agreed that another meeting this
summer would be useful. Further reporting upcoming; will keep you informed. RG

Dear Venkat: I know that you will have had a report directly from Sujata, but I wanted to let you know that, from my
point of view, the 'atmospherics' yesterday here in Geneva were positive. There was no attempt to exploit bilateral
issues or post unwarranted criticism, I am glad to say. I hope to arrive back in Washington in time to participate in some
of our high-level bilateral consultations--uncertain because United Airlines cancelled my flight today, alas. If given the
chance to say a quiet positive word about our meeting yesterday, I will do so. I hope we will have the chance to meet
again before too long.

Yours sincerely,
RG

Dear colleagues:

Thank you very much for a solid and informative stock-taking yesterday. I thought that the format of informal discussion
was very useful, and came away with a clearer sense of the challenges that are facing us as we prepare for the UNGA 1st
Committee in four months' time. I will stay in close touch as I meet with different colleagues in the coming week, and
also confer with my team in Washington. We will then have a chance to take counsel together about next steps, but I
hope we will have another chance to get together before long, perhaps in July.

In the meantime, may I remind you of the confidential nature of our discussions? I think they will be most effective if we
keep them informal and close-hold.

Thank you again for an interesting and useful discussion. I expect to be in touch again soon.

Yours sincerely,

RG
