Bob,

Unfortunately, I won't be in DC either night so will miss you. I hope your portrait unveiling goes well (and that you
approve of your likeness!)

Let's keep trying for a visit. All the best, H

:Hillary,

It's a long shot, but I will be in D.C. next week-end for my portrait hanging at the Pentagon on Monday the
29th. If you're not traveling, maybe we could get together around five or six p.m. either Friday the 26th or
Monday the 29th.

Bob

I just want to offer my personal condolences over the loss of four fine foreign service officers. The Ambassador
was a perfect role model of the kind of person we need representing us around the world, and the others had so
much to give -- and already had given so much.

I know it has been a hard week for you, and I wanted simply to express my sympathy and tell you I \Nras
thinking of you.

Bob Gates
