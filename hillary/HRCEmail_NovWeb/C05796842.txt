(SBU) Beth, Jake, Huma,

(SBU) I just got back from Doha this evening and went immediately to meet with Najib Mikati.                              1.4(B)
                                                                                                                           .4(D)
                                                                                                                           1
                                                                                                                           5

                                                                                                     1.4(D)
                                                                                                      1
                                                                                                      5
