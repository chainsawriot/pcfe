Tony--

Good hearing from you and Happy New Year!

I'm thrilled to be back at the office and trying to catch up on a pile of work and postponed meetings. I'm copying Huma
and Lona to ask whether there's any time we could meet tomorrow.

If we can't, could we schedule a call in the next few days?

All the best, H
