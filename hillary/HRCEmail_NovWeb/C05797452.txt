                                    Friday, January 11, 2013

   • (SBU) Farewell: Laurent, I also wanted to take a moment to thank you for your support
     during my tenure. Thank you for your personal friendship as well as the steadfast support
     of France on Syria, Iran, Libya, Mali and a multitude of other challenges. Working
     together as friends and as partners, we have accomplished a great deal, and I am certain
     my successor will value greatly our relationship with France. It has been a great pleasure
     working with you.

(SBU) Background: The military and security situation in Mali has deteriorated sharply in the
last 24 hours. The French believe it is crucial not to allow northern rebel groups to proceed
south of Mopti in central Mali. Today, the French air force earned out an air strike in Mali in
support of Malian government forces trying to push back the rebels. On December 20, the
UNSC adopted Resolution 2085 to authorize AFISMA to support Malian authorities to recover
areas in northern Mali that are under the control of terrorists, extremists, and armed
groups. Resolution 2085 also urged Malian transitional authorities to finalize a roadmap to
fully restore constitutional order and national unity, and establish a credible framework for
negotiations with all parties in northern Mali who have cut off ties to terrorist organizations.

(SBU) The EU authorized a mission on December 10 to provide 250-400 EU trainers to train
the MDSF; training likely will begin in March, followed by military action in northern Mali
around September. The EU has already pledged funding, but mote resources are needed. The
EU has said that it will not provide equipment for the MDSF. France is demarching many
capitals around the world to ask for equipment, supplies, and/or infrastructure support (and
possibly logistics and salaries) for the MDSF.

(SBU) Georges Ibrahim Abdallah was sentenced to life in prison in 1987 for his involvement in
the 1982 murders of U.S. military attaché Charles Ray and Israeli diplomat Yakov Barsimentov
in Paris, as well as for the 1984 attempted murder of the U.S. Consul General in Strasbourg,

Robert Homme. A former leader of the Marxist-Leninist guerilla group Lebanese Armed
Revolutionary Factions, Abdallah is reputedly one of the longest-serving prisoners in Western
Europe. He became eligible for release in 1999, but seven successive appeals were consistently
denied on the grounds he has shown no remorse for his crime and likely will resume his
revolutionary struggle if released and deported to Lebanon. Although the French Government
has no legal authority to overturn the Court of Appeal's January 10 decision, we hope French
officials might find another basis to challenge the decision's legality.
