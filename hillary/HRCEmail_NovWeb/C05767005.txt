Is there another spot for him? I think he has lots of skille/languages. Is there a problem I don't know about?

he has been tentatively offered a position, Jake Sullivan has encouraged him, but that somehow the whole thing is
tangled up and he hasn't heard for weeks. In the new year, can this get untangled? Thanks. Sid
