Re: NI latest


Shaun Woodward and I spoke this morning. Here is where things stand:

Reg Empey and the UUP have suddenly introduced a non sequitor, a potential monkey wrench into the works.
They demand that there must be radical changes in the education system before dealing with the justice and
policing issues. Of course, this new demand can't be dealt with before March 9. It's an entirely spurious issue
that has nothing to do with the agenda of the peace process and whose only intent can be to upend it. Sinn Fein,
needless to say, would not and cannot support the UUP demand.

Shaun's immediate gambit is to offer creation of a new separate process that after six months might reach some
agreement or at least calm the waters. His proposal would give the UUP a way to back down and save face, if
Empey and the UUP want to do that. Shaun will hold a meeting with the UUP and other parties later today and
will know by late tonight whether Empey is susceptible to reason Or digging in.

The motives behind Empey's and the UUP's intransigence are complex, ultimately irrational and self-
destructive. While Empey has been lured down this primrose path by Cameron's alliance, Cameron now,
publicly at least, supports the peace process, though too softly in private. Despite the supposed promise of
benefit from allying with the supposed inevitable Cameron government, the politics are not at all what they
seem on the surface.

It is emphatically untrue, in fact, that Empey has a political incentive to remain intransigent in hopes of winning
power in the Parliament as part of a Cameron coalition. On the contrary, Empey now has zero—zero-
possiblity of gaining even one parliamentary seat. The single seat the UUP might have secured has been lost to
it in what has turned into a debacle. Its only candidate with a chance for winning, Sylvia Hermon, the very
popular incumbent from North Down, widow of the former chief constable and politically capable in her own

right, was opposed to the alliance with Cameron and the Conservatives, even refusing a position as a whip.
Hermon has always leaned Labour, not Tory. The UUP, furious at her, deselected her, Hermon announced she
will run on the Independent Ulster Unionist line, and the UUP has slated its own candidate to run against her.
She will win. The UUP will lose its sole seat. Labour will then designate her as a whip, according to Shaun;
deal done.

More: The DUP will hold all nine of its seats and likely to win increased support. Empey's intransigent stance is
encouraged by the UUP leadership, driven by deep seated antagonism to the DUP. But the resentment will be
counter-productive in the upcoming elections. If Empey goes along with his dead-enders the UUP will almost
certainly lose a certain percentage of its following that supports the peace process to the DUP. In summary,
Empey has no prospect of winning parliamentary seats and if he provokes an assembly election would likely
lose assembly seats.

The key events are March 6, Saturday, when the UUP assembly party meets to discuss the latest peace accord,
and March 8, Monday, when the UUP will decide.
