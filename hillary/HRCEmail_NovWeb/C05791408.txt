Reports are that they reached consensus on a statement with general principles including peaceful resolution of
maritime disputes, resolving the conflicts in accordance with international law, and an early signing of a legally binding
code of conduct. The statement does not reference specific disputes. This apparently happened late last night out
there, so still waiting for a copy of statement. Will send when I get. Singaporeans have come out and said that it goes
some of the way to repairing the damage from last week.

 Southeast Asian nations are "on the cusp" of agreeing a statement of
 unity on the South China Sea dispute, Indonesia's top diplomat said
 Thursday after meeting his Cambodian counterpart.

 Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa has taken on the role of
 mediator after the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean)
 failed to reach a common position on the row at a gathering in Phnom
 Penh last week.

 "Despite suggestions to the contrary, in actual fact Asean remains
 united," Natalegawa told reporters in the Cambodian capital, on the
 third leg of a regional peacemaking tour after visiting Hanoi and
 Manila on Wednesday.

 Natalegawa said he was working to identify "basic Asean positions on
 the South China Sea", which would dispel the perception that the
 10-member group is divided.

 "We are now on the cusp of formalizing this consensus," Natalegawa said.

 Cambodian Foreign Minister Hor Namhong, whose country holds the
 rotating Asean chairmanship, told reporters he hoped to announce the
 bloc's joint position on Friday, pending "approval from all Asean
 foreign ministers."

 China claims sovereignty over nearly all of the resource-rich sea,
 which is home to vital shipping lanes, but Asean members the
 Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei have overlapping claims in
 the area.

 Divisions over members' territorial disputes with Beijing prevented
 Asean from issuing its customary joint statement at the conclusion of
 its meeting last Friday, an unprecedented occurrence in the bloc's
 45-year history.

 Diplomats said a key sticking point was a refusal by host Cambodia, a
 close China ally, to mention specific incidents in the sea, pitting it
 directly against Manila, which wanted a reference to a months-long
 standoff with China over the Scarborough Shoal.

 The rift has held up progress on a proposed "code of conduct" between
 Asean and China aimed at preventing flare-ups in the contested waters.

 After holding talks with his counterparts in Vietnam and the
 Philippines on Wednesday, Natalegawa urged Asean nations to push on
 with the pact.
