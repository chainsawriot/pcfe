Including mine. Her remarks were really moving. Chris was an amazing man. Such a huge loss. You know, I was in Libya
before coming here and in my almost ten years, I have never worked with such a calm, cool headed, funny
diplomat. Made it all seem really easy- even in one of the hardest places to work in the world.

Please tell the Secretary how much her words meant to us down here. The statement was amazing and the delivery was
so heartfelt and genuine.

We're really blown away.

Please thank her for us.
