                                                     the GOB is moving to take control of Grameen Bank succession by
reasserting control over the search for a new Managing Director to replace Yunus. The Cabinet approved a proposal to
revise the Grameen Bank Ordinance to do this. This would also have the effect of reducing the role of the Bank board
members who largely represent the owner-borrowers. The GOB seems to be stepping up its pressure. Yesterday, the PM
was interviewed on a BBC broadcast in which she was asked by she is going after Yunus, who is a celebrated Nobel
laureate who has done much good for Bangladesh and the world's poor. She attacked him for charging high interest
rates and made other        accusations. Our embassy and SCA are enga!ed
