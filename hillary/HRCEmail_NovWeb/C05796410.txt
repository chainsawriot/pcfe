Subject: Meeting Request

Dear Lona,

I am writing on behalf of former Senator Timothy E. Wirth, President of the United Nations Foundation, who is hoping to
schedule a time to meet with Secretary Clinton to discuss his future plans.

I look forward to hearing the Secretary will have time to meet with him.

Thank you,
Elisa
