Subject: Aleppo Citadel

Dear Ms. Mills, I am taking the liberty of attaching a link to an article that appeared in today's New York Times in case
you did not see it, about the growing concerns about potential damage to the extraordinary Temple of the Storm God,
within Aleppo Citadel. The fate of cultural property may seem a small matter within this vicious conflict, but several
important sites within Syria have been damaged. If there is any renewed negotiation at a diplomatic level, or other
action on the part of the United States, we hope a consideration will be given to the protection of cultural heritage.

Thank you again for your consideration.

Bonnie Burnham
