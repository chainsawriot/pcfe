Subject: Syria: Attacks on Al Meydan (SBU)

Deputy JSE Jean-Marie Guehenno just emailed to me the message below from UNSMIS, which it received from one
contact in Al Meydan. UNSMIS indicated that the information is consistent with explosions and smoke the monitors are
able to hear and see from their hotel, precisely in the direction of that area. They will have difficulty, however, getting a
patrol into the area.

Guehenno said that this information, if true, is cause for great concern. He fears that the government will "try to restore
its capacity to intimidate the population by conducting particularly brutal operations."

Members of the Coordination Committee in the neighbourhood of Al Meydan requested UNSMIS to dispatch
observers to the area. According to the source, government forces are preparing "a massacre" in an area called
Al Kaa.

The security forces are besieging the area and shooting with tanks and artillery; the Free Syrian Army is resisting
as best as it can. Government forces are about to enter the area from two directions, from the al-Majeed mosque
and from al-Doba mosque.

Many civilians are trapped; there is little food, medicine and blood. Many are wounded. A building with many
civilians has just been attacked in al-Kaa Square.
