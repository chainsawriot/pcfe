(SBU) The Palestinians in New York circulated a draft resolution at the UN November 8 and are considering November 29
as their target date for a vote. The Arab League Foreign Ministers will meet in Cairo November 12 and will discuss this
and other pressing issues, including Syria, Sudan, and the Helsinki Conference. There will be an Arab Leagueâ€”EU Foreign
Ministers meeting the following day. The facilitator of the Conveners group for the 2012 Helsinki Conference on a
Weapons of Mass Destruction Free Zone in the Middle East, Ambassador Laajava, has asked the United States to make
high-level calls to Arab League members to press them to respond positively to his proposals.
