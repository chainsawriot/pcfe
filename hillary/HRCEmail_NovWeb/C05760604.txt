Cheryl,

I'm sure you've already seen this story in the NYT. I just wanted to say that I am very sorry that it has played out as it
has.

http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/27/world/americas/27mexico.html? r=1&ref=world

It is unfortunate that the press focus has been on failed states. I would have hoped the stories would have focused on the
work that I have done the past three years leading the Foreign Policy program at Brookings and directing a major
international project on global governance that has called for bringing Mexico, Brazil, China, India and South Africa into
new institutional arrangements for global governance. In the study we stress that none of the major transnational
challenges of the day — from the economic crisis to climate change — can be solved without engaging the world's
emerging economies, starting with Mexico, and giving them an equal seat at the table in an expanded G8.

The other key theme is the work I have done in bringing together "government-wide" initiatives to work in partnership with
other countries. One cannot treat drugs, immigration, energy and international politics in separate cones. Rather, they
affect each other, and our foreign policy needs to integrate these interconnected elements into a coherent strategy that
produces results. The point is that we want to work with our international partners in ways that address their realties —
and not let policy be derived from our bureaucratic structures.

I understand that the situation with Mexico is complicated. I am ready to help in whatever way I can to produce the most
productive outcome.

Carlos
