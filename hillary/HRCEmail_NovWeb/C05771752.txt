FYI -- the DNI call to Collins took place. Clapper wanted you to know.
Nothing definitive, but she appreciated the outreach.

Subject: DNI and New START Calls-Update

To All:

While at a WH meeting yesterday, Secretary Clinton asked the DNI if he would call Senator Collins to provide his insight
and garner her support on New START. Therefore, we wanted to let everyone know that the DNI did talk to Senator
Collins this morning at 0945. She was receptive to his comments; however, not very revealing on her position.

For Rich and Dave:
Would you please ensure that Secretary Clinton is made aware that the DNI did place the call to Senator Collins?

Many thanks,
Deborah
