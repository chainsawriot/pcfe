Sorry — I've been flat out. (And I've agreed to have dinner with Anne-Marie at 7!)

    1. We'll get you a new CGI draft tomorrow morning for you to noodle on. Feel free to call when you've looked at it
       and we can talk about other directions if it doesn't feel right.
    2. Tom   met with Barak today; I will get readout from Sam V tomorrow afternoon. Wendy is going to write points
       for you.
    3. Yousef called to say now that Jeff is gone ABZ has no one to talk to on a regular basis and asked if he could talk
       to Bill Burns.
    4. Ben Rhodes sent me the draft UNGA speech which I will forward to you shortly.
    5. Bill/Wendy are currently in a SVTC on some information that they may want to report to you on — but unclear
       whether there is anything to it.
    6. We've nailed down a $15 mm non-lethal support and $15 mm humanitarian support announcement for next
       Friday's Friends of Syria meeting.
    7. Hold on Rick Olson was lifted by Paul.
    8. Protestors stormed Ansar al Sharia's headquarters in Benghazi, and a huge number marched against militias.
    9. I saw Dennis Ross today for one of our S/P sessions. I can fill you in on the latest on his effort. Also, he will send
       you some stuff in advance of your relevant meetings (he was just in Israel).

That's the key stuff for now. More medium-range stuff to discuss in NY.
