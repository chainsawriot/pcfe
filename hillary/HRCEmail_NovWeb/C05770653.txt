The office has no wifi because of security. But there's a more permanent Internet link for the iPad that I will set up the
next time I have it

Are you in DC or NY?

Let me ask Justin/Huma
And on Monday I'll set it up so that it has a near permanent Internet feed

I don't know if I have wi-fi. How do I find out?

 Pulse - automatically updates when you open it. If you look to the left of each name of the news org, you'll initially see a
circle like symbol. That means it's updating.

Oh, actually the problem you are having is that it needs to find WiFi - do you have WiFi in whatever home you're in now?
We just need to set that up once and it will subsequently connect whenever it senses that wifi.

How do I get the Pulse to update? It still shows what it did when you first demo'd it for me.

Do I need to charge it? If so, how? I have no cords.

Does Huma now know enough to help? Can you show me on Monday?
