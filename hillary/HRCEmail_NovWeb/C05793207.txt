Subject: Officials: Serbia's NATO ambassador leaps to death (AP)

BRUSSELS (AP) - Officials say Serbia's ambassador to NATO committed suicide by leaping from a                                                       busy
parking garage platform at Brussels airport.
  A Serbian government statement said Wednesday that the envoy, Branislav Milinkovic, 52, died instantly on
Tuesday night.
  A diplomat who could not be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media said Milinkovic
suddenly jumped from the 8- to 10-meter-high (26- to 33-foot-high) platform while waiting with the Serbian
delegation for foreign ministry officials due to hold talks with NATO officials.
  Serbia is not a member of the military alliance, but has a mission in the headquarters complex. Milinkovic, a
former journalist, previously served as Serbia's ambassador to Austria.
   The death occurred during two days of meetings of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels.
