Two Sudans Reach Deal on Fees for Oil Pipelines

By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN
Published: August 4, 2012
The New York Times

NAIROBI, Kenya — Sudan and South Sudan have reached a deal on oil pipeline fees, a highly divisive issue that nearly
drove the two countries to war this year, African Union officials announced Saturday.

After some not-so-subtle pressure from Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who visited Juba, the capital of South
Sudan, on Friday, it seems the Southern Sudanese increased the amount they were willing to pay to Sudan, which
controls the pipelines for export. The conundrum the Sudans face is that both countries are extremely dependent on oil,
but while the export pipelines run through the north, the bulk of the crude oil lies in the landlocked south, which
seceded from Sudan last year after decades of guerrilla war.

In January, after having failed to reach an agreement with Sudan on a pipeline fee, South Sudan abruptly shut down all
production, beggaring the economies of both countries. Fighting erupted along the border in April, and many people
feared that the two sides were sliding again into a war that could ripple across East Africa. The last time Sudan and the
rebels from the south fought, from 1983 to 2005, the conflict left more than two million people dead.

But on Saturday at 2:45 a.m., Thabo Mbeki, the African Union's lead mediator and a former president of South Africa,
emerged from a lengthy negotiating session in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and announced: "The parties have agreed on all of
the financial arrangements regarding oil."

It was not clear exactly how much South Sudan is going to pay. The two sides had been very far apart, with the south
saying it would pay no more than $1 per barrel and the north insisting on $36.

According to one person with knowledge of the talks, South Sudan had agreed to pay about $10 per barrel, which would
still be a relatively low amount and very favorable to the south. The Sudanese state-run news media presented the deal
differently, though, saying the figure was closer to $26 per barrel, which apparently includes a lump-sum payment of $3
billion, amortized over several years, that the south has offered to the north.

A day earlier, Mrs. Clinton met South Sudan's president, Salva Kiir, and urged him to strike a deal. At a news conference
afterward, she said, "We need to get those resources flowing again."

"A percentage of something is better than a percentage of nothing," she added.

The impact of an oil deal could be huge because the lack of oil production was fueling inflation on both sides of the
border and making both governments increasingly belligerent and edgy. Diplomats say they hope that cooperation on oil
could spell cooperation on other fronts and lead to a workable peace.

But the two sides have a history of making deals and never fully carrying them out, and many thorny issues — especially
over disputed territory — remain unresolved.

Already, Sudanese officials are sending mixed signals. On Saturday, one minister said, "Sudan and South Sudan have
reached a final agreement on fees to transport South Sudan's oil through Sudanese territories," while another member
of the Sudanese negotiating team stated that the deal "does not fulfill the ambitions of both sides" and that it would be
put into effect only after security arrangements were worked out.

African Union officials said the next round of negotiations would resume this month.
