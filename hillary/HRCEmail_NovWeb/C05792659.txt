Ex-Sen. George McGovern, who lost
presidency to Nixon in historic landslide, in
hospice care
By Associated Press,
                 —
PIERRE, S.D. Longtime former U.S. Sen. George McGovern, the Democratic presidential candidate
who lost to President Richard Nixon in a historic landslide, has moved into hospice care near his
home in South Dakota, his family said Monday.
"He's coming to the end of his life," his daughter, Ann McGovern, told The Associated Press. She
declined to elaborate but noted that her 90-year-old father has suffered several health problems in the
last year.
George McGovern, who became a leader of the Democrats' liberal wing during his three decades in
Congress, lost his 1972 challenge to Nixon, who later resigned amid the Watergate scandal. McGovern
has turned his focus in recent years to world hunger.
It was after a lecture tour last October that he was treated for exhaustion. Two months later, he fell
and hit his head just before a scheduled interview with C-SPAN for a program focusing on failed
presidential candidates who've had a lasting impact on American politics.
McGovern also spent several days in a Florida hospital in April for tests to determine why he
occasionally passed out and had difficulty speaking.
His daughter said he has moved in the Dougherty Hospice House in Sioux Falls, where he moved in
August to spend more time near his family. He had been splitting his time between homes in Mitchell,
S.D., and Florida.
 McGovern was a member of the U.S. House from 1957 to 1961 and a U.S. senator from 1963 to 1981.
