Flagging for you an issue that my sensitivities did not pick up on to until now.

Chris Painter is coming on board to do cyber -- when I interviewed him it was to do cyber
security but over the course of the process apparently evolved to rdoing_7ber issues. In
that vein, it is clear he and Jim see that as meaning that all of         work is approved and
coordinated through him consistent with the mandate of his office. In particular, one of the
talking point bullets for folks after your speech is:

â€¢     As announced in the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, the Secretary is
establishing the Office of the Coordinator for Cyber [Security] Issues and has named Mr.
Chris Painter as its head. [NOTE: Many submitted edits that the office is titled Office of
the Coordinator for Cyber Issues, as per the QDDR.]

I am confident Jim will identify the encompassing of the work and agenda      does as part of
his goal; Phil Verveer also sent me a message last night indicating that he too thought it
critical that Chris' role be clear that he has all cyber.

I am disinclined to mess with what       has been achieving so would seek to make that
distinction clear, even if just an exception of one. But where are you on this?
