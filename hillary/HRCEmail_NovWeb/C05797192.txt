(I've been waiting for the NYT jab...)

This is actually something you've spoken about often, the impossibility of pulling a Kissinger in this day and
age, sneaking to China without anyone knowing. Let me pull that from something and spruce it up for Cole -
who I thought was a sports nut.

I'm happy to respond. What's the deadline?

I'm copying Philippe, the well-known NY Times travel consultant, who has thought about this question, to ask for his
thoughts.

Subject: Cole's Paper

He is writing a paper comparing your tenure as Secretary to that of Kissinger as it relates to the media. He
makes the argument that Secretary Clinton's tenure as Secretary is harder than Secretary Kissinger's because of
the 24 hour news cycle.



This is Cole:
My question for you is: (and no need to respond if of course you prefer not to! - not essential for the paper):

How do you think your job would have been different in the time of Kissinger - specific to the effects of media
between now and then?

Thank You,

Cole Marshall
