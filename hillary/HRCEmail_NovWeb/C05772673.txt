I spoke with the Ambo and our Mil colleagues.

They are working the Security issue ASAP to get a DMAT team in the area (Red Zone) ASAP.

Will keep you posted.

Tim, et al:

I just spoke to Mark Hyman (the doctor with Paul Farmer) on his satellite phone.

He is on his way back to the general hospital.

He said given triage situation everywhere, when I asked him to prioritize his needs, he gave them as follows:

1. food and water

2. electrical generator to perform surgery - some source of power

3. surgical supplies

4. medical supplies

He made one big point - that b/c this is the general hospital, there are more than 1500 patients with more coming in
seeking assistance and the hospital is not operational on any level. That transport of these patients is not wise or a
possibility. We need to establish this as working hospital given that folks seek it out first.

Thank you all for what you are doing

Working on this now

All

I connect this information with Tim Callahan on the ground in Haiti (Mark he is head of the Disaster Assessment team).

He is working this issue.

I understand from Susan that there is limited or no medical supplies or equipment that has hit the ground since last
night; I am assuming the opportunity to address first food and water exists.

Whatever can be done will be done.

We should wait for updates as available with priority being action over updates.

Thanks all.
