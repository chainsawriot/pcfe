                                             Tripoli, Libya
                                  Emergency Message for U.S. Citizens
                                            January 24,2013

The United States continues to advise against all travel to Benghazi. At least two other
diplomatic missions have advised their citizens to leave Benghazi immediately. Although there
is no specific information pointing to specific, imminent threats against U.S. citizens, the
potential for violence and kidnappings targeting Westerners in Benghazi is significant. We
refer all U.S. citizens to the travel warning for Libya issued January 2, 2013, advising against
all travel to Benghazi. Because of ongoing instability and violence, the Department's ability to
provide consular services to U.S. citizens in Benghazi and other regions referenced in the travel
warning is extremely limited. We strongly encourage all U.S. citizens to take appropriate
precautions as the security situation in Libya is volatile. Review your personal safety plans,

remain aware of your surroundings, including local events, and monitor local news stations for
updates. Maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to enhance your personal
security.

We also recommend that U.S. citizens traveling to or living in Libya enroll in the Department's
Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) website. STEP enrollment ensures you receive
updated information on travel and security within Libya, and makes it easier for the U.S.
embassy or nearest U.S. consulate to contact you in an emergency.
For further information, U.S. citizens should consult the Department of State's Country Specific
Information for Libya. Stay up to date by bookmarking our Bureau of Consular Affairs
website, which contains the current Travel Warnings and Travel Alerts as well as
the Worldwide Caution.
You can also follow the Bureau of Consular Affairs on Twitter and on Facebook, and download
our free Smart Traveler App available through iTunes and the Android market to have travel
information at your fingertips. You may also follow U.S. Embassy Tripoli on Twitter and on
Facebook for information for U.S. citizens.
