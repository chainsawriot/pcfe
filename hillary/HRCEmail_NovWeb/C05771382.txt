Here is a read-out of DNI Clapper's call to Senator Chambliss: Excellent 30 minute secure call; Chambliss VERY
appreciative for the outreach; DNI answered all his questions and DNI believes he is inclined to support the Treaty;

In addition, we checked in with Joe Manchin and Chris Coons yesterday, and both are solid on New START.
