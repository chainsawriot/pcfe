- were you able to review the action memo to send a cable to Algerian PM Sella!? NEA needs an answer by Sunday.

- Rob has a new batch of letters for you to sign. If you want to work on them over the weekend, I can drop them off at
the house. Just let me know.

Slight change - the draft testimony came in from Dan so I'm including it in the front pocket of the supplemental briefing
binder.

In about 20 minutes I will leave a pouch with two binders:
- the supplemental briefing is to replace the binder that cheryl gave to you this morning for prep.
- the supplemental reference binder includes additional background materials and is the first time you are seeing it.

Later this evening, Maria will send to you a pouch which will include a new draft of hearing testimony for your review
and an action memo from NEA that they would like approval for over the weekend (a cable to Algerian PM Sellal).
