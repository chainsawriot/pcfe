Huma is out at Nobu with Cheryl, Jake and Philippe.

I am out to dinner with my family 1 block away and will be back by 10:30pm but let me know if you need me back
sooner.

We do not have Roy lined up tomorrow but let me know if you want that changed.

Tomorrow's book will be on your dining room table shortly.
