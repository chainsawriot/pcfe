Had a great discussion w       He's amazing, v helpful but he does not want this job. He spoke to S last night and felt v
good about.

We have an idea for him to chair a boarD for ftf. We have a board - bifad (boards for intl food and ag development) and
we could name him chair and make bifad the ftf board. I will work up some options. He and catherine b are coming to
meet w me on fri.

I feel good about this although I had gone in loaded for bear (w my pitch :-))

Raj
