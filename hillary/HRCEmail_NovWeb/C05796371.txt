Below is what I had already sent to Ayelet, so she knows what I had already sent to Politico. I know not to fight with
her, so don't worry. Not smart, and no reason to. She's not at fault. We're in the same boat. Her hard work was
overshadowed. But I don't blame you for making sure I didn't go to DEFCON 1, from your clips it's clear I've been
doing so a lot lately. But it's only when DEFCON 5 through 2 don't work. BUT, I will say your calling her my 'girlfriend'
is more accurate than ever as it's a similar reaction my exes would have had. Thankfully that was years ago, pre-
Twitter.

For what it's worth, I just told someone who asked for comment on your Tweets: "Ayelet was fun to work with and
believe me we share her frustration with what's happened. Marie Claire put us all in a jam - especially Ayelet who put
months of hard work into this piece. It didn't need to be jacked by their PR people to make a splash. It would
absolutely have stood on its own, probably garnered just as much attention. Just the right kind of attention. They
didn't do her any more favors than us. Hopefully that won't detract from the attention her piece deserves."

Ayelet, please know that I haven't said a word about you. You've seen what I've said to Marie Clare and others and it's
100% directed at Lea and her idiot PR person who let this get out of hand. Not you. Haven't said a single disparaging
word about you. Because I don't think it. Has been quite the opposite in saying that we were all put in a jam by their
original email - which Lea admits was wrong. Marie Claire, through Jill Wantanabe, didn't do you any more favors than
us. The piece didn't need to be jacked the way they did. It stood on its own. Their PR stunt overshadowed
everything.

Also, as a matter of style this is way more than 140 characters...

          I protected Reines and other staff members because I respected their
          off-the-record rants. Something I can't help regretting right now.

r         Maybe Reines and the rest might ponder the comments I did NOT
          publish. He should think very hard before attacking my credibility.

          Clinton's whiner comment came up in the context of work life balance.
          She said lots of great stuff, that included.

          Clinton did not say Slaughter herself was a whiner. I never said she

            her over-protective bulldogs go insane. We were absolutely talking
          about women and work life balance when she made the whining
          comment.

          Now I'm pissed. I wrote a very laudatory piece about Hillary Clinton
          which absolutely accurately quotes her. It gets picked up and ...
