 Seeing you would be a joy in the new year. I'm in nyc one week a month now (which is great because I get to
 spend more time with people like Jon davidson and lynn, brigitte et al). Ill talk to Susie about a rendezvous.




Btw, things are going well with the stj voting rights center at stanford, I have another million to raise which I'm
going to try to accomplish on my next trip to nyc.

 Always your friend, in good times and bad,

 Yashar

  A few things, my friend--


  I love your blogging and am thrilled at your success both because it is YOU and because of the subject. Women all
  around the world need male champions and translators of their/our experiences. And I'm impressed and gratified that
  you have found your voice and an audience. Can't wait for the books! Thank you.

  Howls


  Happiest of New Years to you. Let's try for a visit early in 2012. Maybe you and Susie and I can rendezvous in DC or NYC.
  Blessings and love to you---H

      told me and was so surprised and it filled       heart with joy. I am so grateful you did this amidst your busy
  schedule.

  On a side note, I have not been emailing you my work, but wanted to tell you it's going incredibly well. One of
  my articles was the 22nd most shared article (of any website in the world) on Facebook this year. It was
  incredible to get the news considering my article was flanked by things like Warren Buffett's popular op-ed in
  NY times about coddling the rich and Steve Jobs' Obituary.


  A Message To Women From A Man: You Are Not Crazy

  My website has only been up 4 months and has had 3 million visitors and I have two books going to auction in
  late January. The point is, it was helping you on your campaign in 2007/2008 that ignited my passion to write
  about and for women. Thank you.

  My love to you and your family,
  Yashar
