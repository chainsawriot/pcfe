See below. As we have reported repeatedly to Secretary and rest of Washington, we do not see a crisis or even unusual
problem with 501. I was in Anbar with Abu Risha yesterday, along with GEN Austin. Didn't hear any complaints.

Subject: Leaders deny Iraqi Awakening Council members defecting to al Qaeda



To all:

This is a current story on CNN that quotes two SOI leaders and rebuts
today's
NYT article. MG Askari (MOD Spokesman) also said that he'd provide
reinforcing fires.

Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- The leaders of Awakening Councils in two Iraqi
provinces Sunday denied a report that hundreds of council members have
defected to al Qaeda.

"There is no way that my fighters would join al Qaeda, no matter what,
because their principles and their goals are to hunt down al Qaeda members
in Iraq," said Sheikh Hussam al-Majmaei, leader of the Awakening Council in
Diyala province, who has more than 13,000 fighters under his command.

The New York Times reported Sunday that hundreds of fighters appear to have
rejoined al Qaeda in recent months, many of them after gaining extensive
knowledge of the U.S. military. The report cited unnamed Iraqi government
officials, current and former Awakening Council members and insurgents.

Al-Majmaei said that in the past two months, 150 fighters from the Diyala
Awakening Councils have left -- not because they wanted to join al Qaeda,
but because they became targets for al Qaeda and other insurgent groups.
"Those who left their jobs with the Awakening Council started working in
different jobs and most of them became farmers," he said.

"All the fighters in Diyala province who are under my command are from
well-known tribes and they are our sons and our people," al-Majmaei told
CNN.

Awakening Councils, also known as the Sons of Iraq, are mainly comprised of
Sunni Arab fighters who turned on al Qaeda in late 2006. The U.S.-backed
movement is credited as being one of the main factors that contributed to a
drop in violence across Iraq, but council members have become targets for
remaining jihadists.

Sheikh Hamad al-Jabouri, leader of the Awakening Council in Salaheddin
province, said all of his 11,333 fighters support and help the Iraqi
government.

"Some politicians within the government want to give a bad reputation to our
fighters because they want to get rid of us and to pass their political
agenda," he said. "I am a tribal leader and I have a very good relationship
with the government, like any other tribal leader in Salaheddin, and if some
parties want to give us a bad reputation then this means they have an
agenda, even though those politicians are within the government."
