Sorry. Just saw this.

I wanted to thank the Secretary and your entire team for your help. You guys were really there for us when it counted. I
hope this thing will hold - but no matter what, your efforts are deeply, deeply appreciated. I know my boss wants to
thank the Secretary as soon as we can arrange the call.

Happy Thanksgiving.

Ron
