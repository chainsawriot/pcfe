GHANA MAY EXTRADITE FORMER OFFICIAL TO COTE D'IVOIRE
(SBU) Ghanaian authorities executed an international arrest warrant for former Ivoirian budget minister Justin
Kone Katinan on charges of economic crimes committed during Cote D'Ivoire's post-election violence in 2010
and early 2011, media report. Embassy Accra comments the Ghanaian government currently is reviewing
Katinan's granted refugee status, which it may revoke prior to transferring him to Ivoirian authorities. Embassy
Abidjan comments this Ivoirian-Ghanaian bilateral issue must be resolved transparently as it could create
precedent for future cases. (Ops/Embassy Accra telcon, Ops/Embassy Abidjan telcon, Reuters)

NAM SUMMIT COMMENCES IN IRAN
(SBU) Iranian Foreign Minister Salehi stated Iran will present a comprehensive Syria proposal on the sidelines
of the Non-aligned Movement summit in Tehran, media report. Iran Regional Presence Office Dubai comments
this is an example of Iran's use of the forum to advance its foreign policy priorities to distract from its own
violations of international obligations.

VENEZUELA REFINERY ACCIDENT SPURS ALLEGATIONS OF LAPSES
(SBU) The gas explosion at the Amuay facility, the country's largest refinery, follows repeated mishaps during
the last decade across installations run by state oil companies, media report. The Venezuela desk comments the
accident may highlight the Chavez administration used profits to fund ambitious domestic programs instead of
reinvesting in oil production facility maintenance. (Ops/Venezuela desk telcon, Reuters)

SYRIA UPDATE
(U) Opposition activists accused President Asad's forces of killing 440 people across Syria on August
25. Activists claim 200 of the dead were in Daraya, where many were executed by gunshots at close
range. (Reuters)
