David Petraeus will testify on Benghazi
By    KATIE GLUECK     11/14/129:32 AM EST Updated: 11/14/12 9:54 AM EST
Gen. David Petraeus will testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein told POLITICO

Wednesday morning. But the exact schedule has not been set for his testimony.


"Mr. Petraeus has indicated his willingness [to testify]. He is eager to come before the committee so we will work out the details," Feinstein said.


Earlier Wednesday, Fox New reported that the former director of the CIA who resigned last week over an extramarital affair, will still testify voluntarily on Friday

before congressional intelligence committees regarding the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya.


Petraeus was initially slated to offer testimony on Benghazi at closed hearings before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday.


Feinstein, the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on CNN's "The Situation Room" on Tuesday that she believed Petraeus would eventually

appear before the committee because he is a "responsible person."
