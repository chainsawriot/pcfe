The Egyptians mentioned this to me (and I wrote up the report), but have the Saudis (before this call)?

At 1800 Riyadh, the Saudis will announce that they are inviting the Iraqis to meet in Riyadh. They will invite the
president, the prime minister, and the heads of parties. The Saudis will provide the venue but will not interfere in the
discussion.

There is now no pending call request.
