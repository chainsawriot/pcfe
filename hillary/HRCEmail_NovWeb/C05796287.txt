Dear Madam Secretary - I met with Secretary Patricia Espinoza yesterday to brief her on the work of the USMex
Foundation following our annual board meeting in San Miguel Allende on Tuesday. Just want you to know that she
expressed such admiration for you AND gratitude that you have treated her with such respect and genuine kindness. She
said she considers you a role model and looks forward to supporting your work after you leave government. Btw - I had
the opportunity to brief old NAFTA friends who are part of Pena Nieto's team. Bottom line is that we are gaining great
traction in Mexico. Thanks for all of your help. This could simply have not happened without your help. Un Abrazo, jose
