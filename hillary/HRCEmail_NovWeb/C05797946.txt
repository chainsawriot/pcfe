Subject: Hollande says France has begun Mali military operation (Reuters)

PARIS (Reuters) - France's armed forces began a military intervention in Mali on Friday afternoon to help the
government there stem a push southwards by Islamist rebels who control much of the north, President Francois
Hollande said.

  "French forces brought their support this afternoon to Malian army units to fight against terrorist elements,"
Hollande told reporters in Paris. "This operation will last as long as is necessary."

   Hollande added that United Nations Security Council resolutions meant France was acting in accordance
with international laws.
