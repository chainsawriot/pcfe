Thanks for the info:

-- we have a statement ready to respond to the Kyl op ed. We also have briefed Durbin and McCain and both staffs so
they hopefully are ready for sunday shows. We also did a conference call with meet the press producers with the
negotiaing team. In addition, we have a fact sheet and excerpts from previous testimony ready to be sent to all senate
offices rebutting the alleged "secret deal" with Russia. We will continue making the national security case and working
with bob corker, but he wants some distance between us and him - that's what allowed him to be with us in committee.

Thanks again.

Rich Verma

Subject: New START intel out of TN:



- Corker is still being savaged by Heritage activated county commissioner level START opponents -weird, not exactly
grass roots - and there's not nearly enough pushback (need national security message.)

- Kyl has a an op-ed tomorrow and doing news shows Sunday. They expect McCain, Durban to join him - The opponents
are still pushing modernization and now this new thing alleging the admin cutting "secret deals" with Russia on
defenses

- they really need help with pushback - including the kinds of points Gen Adams was highlighting about the
breakthroughs with allied/Russia agreement on missile defense in Lisbon - and some urgent help in Tennessee - can we
get Castellaw, others?
