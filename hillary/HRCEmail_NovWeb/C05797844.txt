Bob,

Thanks for the kind words of condolences and support for our losses and for the work that we are doing around the
world in difficult and dangerous places.

 hope we have the chance for a visit--and, maybe a drink-- in the next few months.

Al! the best, H

Hillary,

I just want to offer my personal condolences over the loss of four fine foreign service officers. The Ambassador
was a perfect role model of the kind of person we need representing us around the world, and the others had so
much to give -- and already had given so much.

I know it has been a hard week for you, and I wanted simply to express my sympathy and tell you I was
thinking of you.

Bob Gates
