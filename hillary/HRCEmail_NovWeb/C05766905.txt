Apologies for Cross-Posting



Dear Colleagues:



I am pleased to announce that I have been asked to join the State Department as the Deputy Assistant Secretary
of State in the Bureau for Population, Refugees and Migration. I anticipate assuming this position before the
end of the year.



You may have received a previous email from me indicating that I had accepted a post as a Senior Fellow at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies. As I was preparing to join CSIS, I received a call from the State
Department asking me to become the DAS in PRM. While the timing was unusual, this can often be the case
with political appointments.



I am most grateful for the gracious understanding of the CSIS team to take the opportunity to serve my country
on vital humanitarian issues, as well as to the Center for American Progress for giving me the opportunity lead
the Sustainable Security Program there.



For the time being, I can continue to be contacted at                      until my official State Department       B6
contact information is available.



Sincerely yours,


       UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766905 Date: 11/30/2015
