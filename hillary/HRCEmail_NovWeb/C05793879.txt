Latest from mike.
On russia call now, and dcm and advance have heard same from mfa that this is a case of reciprocity. They are treating
this meeting the same way they perceived medvedev was treated at camp david. Basically a last minute confirmation
and a brief meeting. But they say not to worry, meeting will be taking place.

So we have engaged NSA Patrushev, MFA folks, and others in Kremlin today to get our message across on the
importance of sit down bilat.




Just explaining, not excusing.

We also continue to hear from people in Moscow that everything will work out fine:
