Subject                           Would love to talk to you today                                                   B6


Sorry you had to give up Jack Lew
Know you are thinking about next step. I want yo to have what and who you need, but I think                    would be
terrific.
Know that            name has been all over blogosphere, nothing she is happy about Don't have to tell you how
extraordinary she is Know she wants you to have exactly what you want and need I had always hoped she would have
Jim Steinberg job but know that is not what is on table and Lew job is great one If you decide you want        I think I
can help You know how hard it was when AID fell through So if she is what you are looking for, let me know If not, she
will be fine with what works for you.
Would love to talk to you about this today or in next few days Barb
