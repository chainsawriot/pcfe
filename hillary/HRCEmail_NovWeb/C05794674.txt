Jakeâ€”I'm doing this speech on Tuesday July 24 at Mark Penn's request. See his topic suggestion below and let's discuss:

Thanks for coming to the holocaust museum genocide conference. It's a worthwhile event and CNN is the media
partner. Think it would be great to give one of the bookending speeches I think you should give as you wind down your
term with the future of human rights in a global economy being a topic I'd suggest. The advance we have seen in human
rights in the last 4 years and how economic development will lead to unstoppable demands for expanded rights. (just a
thought).
