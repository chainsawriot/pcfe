Hi Cheryl. Before you disappear to a beach on a secluded island (or whatever is your equivalent), I wanted to
congratulate you on everything you have accomplished in the last 4 years. Obviously, the Secretary's tenure has been
nothing short of a triumph, personally and professionally. I know that so much of the praise she's enjoying is the direct
result of an incredible effort on your part. Thanks for everything you've done - I hope you get some fun and relaxation
for a nice long while. If you ever get a minute, I'd love to catch up with you and hear about what you are thinking for
your next act. Be well, and all the best. Joel
