Subject: Update for HRC on MillenniaIs gender equality project

Hi Cheryl:

I hope you're doing well and got a few days off this week. Congratulations to all of you for the great work on
the cease fire.

HRC asked me to keep her up to date on an initiative I'm involved with, to mobilize the Millennial generation to
embrace the cause of gender equality in the U.S. Melanne suggested I send the update to you.

I've attached a short update memo, and a quick-reading "visual briefing" with info I thought she would be
interested in seeing. Would you kindly pass that on to HRC for me? Please let me know if you need anything
else.

All the best, Doug
