I think this is a great idea. Can we get it ready by Thursday or Friday?

This just came from Vartan. Maybe it's something you want to do this week with Karzai here.



Dear Secretary Clinton:

Carnegie Corporation has been a supporter of the World Digital Library, a major project of the Library of Congress and
James H. Billington, the Librarian. dyer the last several years, we have given them grants totaling $4,000,000, including,
in December, a renewal grant of $2,000,000. In the course of working out the renewal grant, I asked Dr. Billington
whether he could do a singular service to Afghanistan and the Afghan people by having copies of the entire corpus of
the Library's holdings on the country—a vast collection including history, literature, arts, etc.—put together and given
to the country's National Library and eight of its top universities, as a kind of repatriation of Afghan heritage. Dr.
Billington heartily agreed.

Then we discussed the best way of transmitting this corpus to the Afghans. We both thought that it would be a fitting
tribute for you, as you conclude your amazing and successful tenure as Secretary of State, to be the person to hand this
to the Afghan foreign minister or Ambassadors, in Washington or New York, during the month of January. We'd be
happy to announce it at the State Department, the Library of Congress, or Asia Society, UN, or even Carnegie
Corporation. Naturally, we are all at your disposal and will accommodate you in any way we can.

I'm delighted that you are well and have resumed your duties.

Yours,
Vartan
