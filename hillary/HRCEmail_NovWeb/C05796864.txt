Cheryl,

I just wanted to express my support and prayers for Secretary Clinton as she regains her health.
I'm in CA for the Holiday break and all I've been asked was about Sec. Clinton's health and that many people across the
country are praying for her speedy recovery.

I also wanted to also send my support and prayers to you as we begin another New Year.
Thank You for your service. I don't know how you do it, but know that I'm thankful and appreciative of your leadership.

Take Good Care Cheryl; may you have a blessed New Year. And know that Secretary Clinton and you are in my prayers.

Peace and Love,

Vida



PS: I don't know what your plans are post State Dept, but my hope is to see you again sometime in 2013 and to break
bread w/you over lumpia and empanadas :).
Please do not hesitate to forward us your contact information post State Department
service.
