bear Cheryl,




You may recall that we met late last year when Secretary Clinton received Bernard Schwartz
and me to discuss our proposal to raise a significant amount of private funds (without her
involvement) to enable Baruch College to re-name and expand its School of Public Affairs as the
"Hillary Rodham Clinton School of Public and International Affairs" and to establish, in parallel,
the "Hillary Rodham Clinton Library" to house her correspondence as First Lady, Senator and
Secretary of State. When we concluded the meeting, Secretary Clinton indicated that she was

intrigued by the proposal, but that it was premature to make a decision, given that she had not
yet decided about her post-government plans.




Bernard and I responded that we fully understood this point and that we were prepared to be
patient while her thinking evolved. During this time, we have refrained (and will continue to
refrain) from any fundraising efforts or any public discussion of the idea. We are, in fact,
eager to coordinate closely (and quietly) with you and the Secretary's other key staff as her
thinking and planning evolves over the coming months. At the same time, I can report that
Bernard and I have privately discussed the matter with the CUNY Chancellor, Matthew
Goldstein, who is enthusiastically supportive of the idea and prepared to be helpful in a variety
of ways.




At this point, I am seeking only to gain assurance that the proposal continues to be under active
consideration by Secretary Clinton, and that we might be able to engage with you and/or Huma
Abedin at an appropriate point in the coming months to discuss the details and our plans for
implementation.




Sincerely,




Mitch Wallerstein
