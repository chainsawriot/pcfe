Reading the Secretary's remarks at Wellesley, I realized that we both participated in the August 1968 demonstrations at
the DNC in Chicago. We also both went through the Panther/Cambodia demos at Yale in 1970, but I was arrested and
she (thankfully) was not.

My mother also took me to hear MLK in Washington in 1963.

Please convey my regards.
