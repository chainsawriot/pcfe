                Why does Hillary Clinton appear so capable at Senate hearing? Because she knows her
                brief and the issues better than anyone in the room.

                Conspiracy-mongers are gonna go nuts after Clinton's testimony today. For someone with
                serious health scares last month, she looks fabulous.

                Shorter Hillary Clinton: "You can't handle the truth!"

                Nobody puts Hillary in a corner.

                Hillary Clinton is doing magnificently in the Benghazi hearing. Strong, clear, focused on
                solutions. She will be missed.

                Toughest exchange in hearing w/ Wisconson GOP Sen Johnson over talking pts Clinton

         Subtext of Clinton shouting at Sen. Johnson: There's nothing you can do to me now, so
         I'm not taking any more of your shit.

      1. Josh Rogin @joshrogin


         "What difference at this point does it make?!" whether there was a protest. Clinton yells
         at Ron Johnson. Damn.

      1. Laura Seay @texasinafrica


         I'm a little in awe.
