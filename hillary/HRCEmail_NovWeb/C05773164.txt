Subject: News Emerging from Septet Meeting; P's Asking for Clarification



Israeli media (Yediot and Maariv websites, likely others) and foreign media (AP, DPA, likely others) are carrying accounts
of the Septet's meeting tonight and consideration (or alternatively, approval, or alternatively that BN recommended) of
a 90-day extension which explicitly excludes Jerusalem. Mostly non-sourced reports in the Hebrew media, but also
some Jerusalem-based "diplomatic sources" (which means GOI) as well.

                                                                                                                             B1
                                                                                                                             1.4(B)
                                                                                                                             1 4(E)


I would like to get back to them tonight with something that speaks to:

                                                                                                                                 B5




Thanks for whatever guidance can be provided today.

Daniel
