The International Fund for Ireland is an international organization created in 1986 by the British and Irish governments,
with contributions from the US, EU and several Commonwealth countries (the US contributions are from ESF funds).
The US doesn't have a seat on the board, but it does have an observer at board meetings. See:
http://www.internationalfundforireland.com/about-the-fund

I doubt that USAID has anything to do with this position, since it is not one of the "Enterprise Funds" jointly managed by
EUR and USAID, and USAID has never had any programs in or for Ireland as far as I know. If the US Observer position is
like US representation to other international financial institutions like the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, it is
handled by Treasury. I haven't been able to reach anyone in PPO today but will try again on Tuesday to confirm that this
position is selected by PPO for Treasury.

r      ias mentioned this to me but I think she was told that there would be no movement until US AID was more
settled. She has been getting Irish American members to write letters.

I think Sen Leahy has always had an interest in this position in the past so not sure if he has weighed in.
