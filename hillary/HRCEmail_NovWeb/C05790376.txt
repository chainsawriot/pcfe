Jay watches the Iran nuclear file very closely and shapes opinion in press corps. Worth noting his take, which at this
point is pretty pessimistic.

Don't see how this ends well anymore.

Iran's nuclear chief said Sunday there are no reasons at the moment for his country to halt production of uranium
enriched to 20 percent, a key demand of world powers.
The West is concerned that the 20-percent enrichment could quickly be turned into nuclear weapons-grade material.
Iran insists its nuclear development program is for peaceful purposes.
The nuclear chief, Fereidoun Abbasi, was quoted by the semiofficial ISNA news agency as saying that Iran will continue
the higher enrichment level for a medical research reactor that produces isotopes for treatment of about 1 million
cancer patients in Iran.
"There is no reason for us to back down on 20 percent-level enrichment, because we produce only as much 20 percent
material as we need," Abbasi said. "Not more, not less."
He also said Iran has not yet been convinced to allow the U.N. nuclear agency access to a military complex to probe
suspicions that in 2003, Tehran secretly tested explosives needed to set off a nuclear bomb. The suspected blasts would
have taken place inside a pressure chamber.

Abbasi's statement about enrichment echoed Iran's objections last week at a meeting with world powers in Baghdad to
a proposal to suspend 20 percent enrichment in exchange for a U.S.-supported package that would include supplying
Iran with radioactive material and civilian plane spare parts.
Iran seeks to have Western oil embargo and banking sanctions eased before considering suspension of 20 percent
enrichment.
The six powers _ the United States; Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany _ fear the higher-enriched uranium could
be quickly boosted to weapons-grade material of 95 percent.
U.S. officials have said Washington will not ease its insistence that Iran must fully halt uranium enrichment, but
speculation is increasing that the priorities have shifted to block the 20 percent enrichment level while possibly allowing
Iran to maintain lower-level nuclear fuel production, at least for now.
Abbasi said a visit by IAEA to Parchin military site, southeast of Tehran, will not come any time soon.
"We haven't been convinced yet (to allow an IAEA visit to Parchin). No reasons and documents have been presented to
enable us to arrange a visit to Parchin, which is a military site," he was quoted by ISNA as saying.
Iran has never said whether the alleged chamber existed, describing Parchin as a conventional military site, not a nuclear
facility.
Iran previously said IAEA inspectors would be allowed to visit Parchin, but first there would have to be agreement
between the two sides on guidelines for the inspection.
