Faithfully Democratic
By Burns Strider

The Democratic National Convention is what one would expect — loud, passionate, diverse and uplifting. This
one is also humid and wet. The remnants of Hurricane Isaac have the air sticky and heavy like a New Orleans
night; a metaphor, perhaps, to this election and the discomfort Americans feel as they watch the paralyzing
disdain and distrust the two major parties hold for one another.

Politics can be inspiring, or at least should be. And this convention has indeed inspired whether by showcasing
a first lady who powerfully reminded us that compassion and care are the bedrock of the American dream. The
words of mayors, governors and former presidents also exemplified the strength of conviction and the power of
living what they preach.

I'm a Democrat motivated to action by my faith. This convention has been robust with opportunities for the
faithful to join in reflection and worship as well as meet, coordinate and plan how we best share our testimonies
with other people of faith around the nation.
I believe the party's platform, our basic principles for the next four years, has the most bold and unwrapped
section on faith and our support of resources for faith-based programs and projects than any platform of any
party
In fact, the platform is telling. Republicans were anxious to attack Democrats for having a platform that didn't
specifically mention the word "God," which, by the way, was amended, by acclamation, to include the word
"God."
Regardless, Fox News has been showcasing graphs that tally up the number of times Democrats and
Republicans have written "God" over the years in their platforms, almost like a baseball game score.

I'm not into word counts. And, neither are Americans. We all know that we are known by the results of our
labor. If some want to sit around and count words while Democrats build a platform that empowers people of
faith so be it. The power of living what we preach is on display at this convention.
Values over process. Results over the superficial. Heart over strategy. Examples lived from the Word, not the
example of a word.
Jena Lee Nardella closed the first night's proceedings with prayer. Nardella is a young evangelical Christian
who helped found Blood: Water Mission, which works to end H1V/AIDS in Africa as well as provide clean
drinking water. She is a powerful example of a new energy and strength of conviction within evangelicalism. In
her prayer, from the dais the hall, she prayed for both President Obama and Republican presidential nominee
Mitt Romney as the delegates bowed in silence.
Former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, a Methodist with a master's in divinity from Asbury, spoke about the
"dignity of a good job and a good salary." He reminded us that effort and hard work, along with a helping hand,
has created the great American middle class.
Earlier in the evening, San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro said, "The American dream isn't a sprint or even a
race, it's a relay." The young leader emphasized the democratic and American value that we are in it together,
we stand united, working for the common good.
A healthy tension that exists in America is finding just the right degree of individualism and community. Our
politics, be it over economics, social issues or the basic meaning of America, often comes down to this duality
of thought. It's been with us since the beginning of our democracy.
There is no permanent answer. There is only a permanent debate.
It must be civil or we get lost in name calling and word counting. And, we all, both sides, certainly must affirm
the need for both a passion for individual freedom and rights and pathways to opportunity as well as the
community of Americans that supports and holds and serves one another, lending a helping hand.
This is what we see played out in the application of faith into politics, including the drama of the party
conventions. And, much more is taking place than only what is seen on television. Off the big stage, meetings
and panels are taking place. Old and young clergy as well as young faith activists are seeking a voice and many
of us with a voice convene to listen to one another.
The Democratic Faith Council sponsored panel discussions to packed rooms with panelists who are Baptists,
Mormon, Jewish, Catholic and the entire, diverse bandwidth of the American religious tradition. We discussed
our role in sharing the narrative of our party. We discussed the power of our collective efforts as the voice who
tells the story, the story of values and faith of the Democratic Party.
The story this week is about a political party that lives what it preaches, about allowing the fruits of our labor
define us, not the word counters, and embracing the values of the common good, where we make sure our God
given talents and dreams exists in a land flowing with opportunity.
