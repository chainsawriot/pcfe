She was terrific! Talked about studying to be a journalist and wanting to be a reporter like Christiane Amanpour. When
she got her White House job, she hoped it would be in Press office a la Chrlstiane, but instead was assigned to Melanne
in policy.

Her mom's best advice was "if Plan A doesn't work, go with Plan B". She did and embraced the Melanne job and has
worked in incredible positions with you for 16 years.
