Subject: Families to visit Gaza prisoners in Israel (AP)

GAZA CITY (AP) - Relatives of Gaza prisoners held in Israel are headed for their first visit with them in more
than six years.
   Israel agreed to the visits in May as part of a deal to end a mass hunger strike by Palestinian prisoners.
   Abdullah Qandil, a leader of a prisoners affairs, group, says relatives of 26 Palestinian prisoners have gathered
at the passenger crossing between Israel and Gaza on Monday with a Red Cross escort.
   He says they'll go from there to the prison where their relatives are being held.
   Israel is holding 450 prisoners from Gaza in all.
   It stopped the family visits after llamas militants captured an Israeli soldier in 2006. The soldier came home
in a prisoner swap last October, and the hunger strikers had demanded the visits resume.
