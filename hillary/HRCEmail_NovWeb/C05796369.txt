We just checked w/ L, AF and the Sudan Special Envoy's office and are all unaware of any information about a "lobbyist
for Southern Sudan (who) is negotiating with the state department on a deal that would destroy these victims of the
ability to collect money from Sudan."

S/USSESS was contacted by John Eaves (the author of the below e-mail) in January to discuss the victims' claims.




That is where things had been left til the message today to you. Pls let us know what if anything you'd like us to do.
Best
Harold

Burns,
On the case where we represent the survivors and families for the embassy bombings, we just learned that the lobbyist
for Southern Sudan is negotiating with the state department on a deal that would destroy these victims of the ability to
collect money from Sudan. If you remember, last year after putting on a weeks worth of expert testimony the District
court in DC gave us a judgment finding that Sudan was directly responsible for supporting and helping the terrorist who
carried it out. We were hoping that the State dept would help us just like they required Libya to pay the victims of all of
its terrorist acts before they were granted "restored relations" in 08. I know that there may be more important national
interest involved but supporting the State Dept employees and their families who sacrificed so much should at least be
one of them. I'll be coming to DC next week but can come up anytime. John
