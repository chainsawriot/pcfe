MA--

I'm so nervous about the election, I can't think about much else (which is probably just as well since this is a BIG
birthday!) You've been great w all you've done for the President.

So, thanks, my friend, for your good wishes. We are overdue for a visit so let's try to find a time before the end of the
year--if we can!

Enjoy Prague---H
