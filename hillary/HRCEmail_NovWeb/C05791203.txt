To the Editor:

Re "&# Â£;*(!@#@$QW$WoUDEHTYITY*erqyYP/0^I" by Michael Patrick Allen (Playbook, June 8)

I have been a loyal Apple user since the Apple II. I have never owned a home computer that wasn't a
Mac. I never will. I travel with a MacBook Air. I have an iPad, two AppleTVs, a Touch, every generation
Nano, and those colored socks to keep them safe. I'm engrossed in Walter Isaacson's book. I stuck with
the company through the dark hours of the Lisa, the Newton, and John Sculley's tenure. I don't even
question why they insist on including with every product sold those 1970s era decals of the Apple logo,
and dutifully affix them to my notebooks and other school supplies.

But no amount of affection from Playbook can give the iPhone what it sorely lacks: a keyboard.

In Washington, we must write quickly and accurately to earn a living. We file on deadline. We draft TPs
for our boss. We write statements. We PIN. The keyboard matters most. If we lived in NYC and had
to check the price of the Nikkei, or lived in LA and had to review the latest trailer for 'Lincoln,' we'd do well
with an iPhone. But not in Washington.

iPhone owners love them, for good reason. But one thing you never hear them say is, "Wow, I love
writing on this thing and 'pity' those still saddled with the Blackberry's tedious keyboard." And even if
they did say it, Siri would convert it to, "You like riding in a saddle when Teddy is bored?"

If the author were on a desert island but still expected to produce Playbook every single day, would he
choose to write it on an iPhone, or a Blackberry? I for one could not imagine writing this, letter on
anything other than my trusted Bold.
