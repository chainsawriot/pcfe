Subject: Gallup shows Romney with a Seven Point Lead - What Does This Mean?

Republicans are overjoyed. Democrats are tearing out their hair. Twitter may explode.

A couple thoughts and some perspective:

    1) The latest Gallup poll covers the dates of Oct. 11-Oct. 17 which means it is only
       capturing one day of post-debate sentiment. We won't have a full post-debate sample
       until Tuesday (Oct. 16-22). I will leave it to Gary to explain any other details about
       polling methodology etc.
    2) There is an expectation by many that the race will tighten back up next week, thanks in
       part to an expected boost in Democratic enthusiasm.
    3) That said, if Romney retains a lead in this poll — or any other airworthy poll, it suggests
       that Romney's big win in Denver and his solid performance at Hofstra helped him to
       finally clear the "acceptability" bar with those wavering Obama 2008 voters he needs to
       win over. The Romney campaign has long held that this race will resemble 1980 where
       the race remained very close until the very end when it broke dramatically in Reagan's
       favor. Like Romney, Regan's big break came from a solid debate performance. However,
       the political polarization in this country is much more intense and solidified than it was
       in 1980.
