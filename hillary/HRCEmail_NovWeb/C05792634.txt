Amid tensions in Washington embassy,
Israel's deputy U.S. envoy reassigned
A new deputy ambassador is due to be appointed to
Washington in the next few weeks.

Deputy ambassador to the United States Baruch Bina was on Wednesday appointed Israel's man in
Denmark, in a move that is expected to end the strained relations in Washington between the Israeli
ambassador, Michael Oren, and Bina.
The ministry hopes Bina's transfer will improve relations in the Washington embassy, Israel's most
important and sensitive diplomatic mission.
A new deputy ambassador is due to be appointed to Washington in the next few weeks.
Oren's contract has recently been extended by one year. If Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wins
the elections, Oren is expected to complete four years in this post. As a confidant of Netanyahu's,
Oren was appointed by the prime minister in coordination with the foreign minister. He is therefore
unlikely to remain in office if Netanyahu loses the elections.

Ministry, while Oren claimed Bina was undermining him and acting against him vis-a-vis U.S.
officials and other diplomats in the embassy.

leave his post after six months.
The ministry's supreme appointments committee, headed by Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon,
yesterday also appointed ministry Deputy Director for Asia and the Pacific Ruth Kahanov as Israel's

European Union department, was appointed Israeli ambassador to Portugal and Shmuel Ben-Shmuel,
who served as head of the Diaspora Division, was appointed Israeli ambassador to Australia.
