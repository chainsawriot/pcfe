Subject: RE: Funds

I think this is good news and the event, which will flag for Capricia and Huma should be styled differently than a
groundbreaking given Secretary Albright's ground-breaking event, should go forward from my perspective.

I will share the two flags that have been identified, one of which will be addressed by the event the other of which I
welcome a plan:

    1) Albright already held a groundbreaking ceremony for USDC in Nov 2000.

http://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/pubs/8526.htm
In October 1999, Secretary Albright reaffirmed her commitment to the creation of a "permanent, state-of-the-art exhibit
on the history and meaning of diplomacy and foreign affairs" to be known as the United States Diplomacy Center. It
would include on-site programs, events and tours, and off-site Internet access, and be located in the northeast corner of
the former War Department building section of the Department of State, with an entrance on 21st Street. A planned
area of 18,000 square feet was to be devoted to exhibitions and multimedia space, with the shared use of another
17,000 square feet in the adjacent Conference Center, East Auditorium, and lobby. A groundbreaking ceremony was
held on November 1, 2000. Funds were being raised by the Foreign Affairs Museum Council, a nonprofit organization,
and the Center's opening was projected for the year 2004. At the end of the Clinton administration, the Office of the
Historian continued to play a supporting and advisory role, especially concerning historical artifacts, historical context
for exhibits, and staffing.



       2) Continued staffing and fundraising needs. $18million pays for the construction of the Pavilion. As we all know,
          another $5 million is needed for exhibits in the Pavilion, plus the two interior halls (2"d phase of construction)
          cost approx $23mi1 for renovation and exhibits. We need a permanent structure/team to continue fundraising
          and designing/updating exhibits so we don't end up with a half finished or empty building. Can we get a plan
          for continued fundraising efforts?

 Best.

Good news! We just received two payments in the mail today: $1 mil from Caterpillar, thanks to Tom, and $500,000
from Starr Foundation, with total cash on hand at $19 mil - $1mil more than the goal stipulated by GSA to let the
contract and break ground. We're also receiving $500,000 as a down payment from Fedex by Jan. 15.

Attached is the cost breakdown for your review.

So now that we're ready to break ground and display the cornerstone with HRC's name embedded on the glass, we need
a date. As you know, I was initially given the window of Jan 14-18, and within that time frame, Secretary Baker, who has
donated Simi' to the Center, indicated that he could only attend on Jan 16, but I could of course go back to him if we
moved it later in the month.

Please let me know soonest so that I can contact the former Secretaries, especially Jim Baker and Henry Kissinger, who
have been invaluable supporters of the Center, and we can meet with Protocol et al re logistics.

Many thanks,

Elizabeth
