We can work up a letter from you to Voinovich on this if that would be best way to close the loop.

Subject: Lithunia and Latvia both officially support START

Update:

Latvia:


Our Ambassador spoke this afternoon to the Latvian Political Director and he said that Latvia does not have
any concerns and in fact MFA is proposing that President Zatlers laud the new START in his remarks at UNGA

Lithuania:


Our A/DCM spoke this afternoon with the Lithuanian Political Director and the poldir expressed surprise that
there was any question about Lithuanian support for START. They have no problems with START and
welcome it. The poldir speculated that perhaps someone was conflating START with real Lithuanian concern
over A/CFE (even as they welcome our strong consultation with them as the A/CFE process moves
ahead).
