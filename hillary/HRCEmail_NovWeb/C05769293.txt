Pulled me aside after a meeting on another topic to express his interest in being involved in long term Haiti planning —
everyone loves Haiti now. He pushed that "there is a body of literature that disasters give rise to new opportunities". I
said we had a plan and agree that we need to ask how responding to the disaster requires modification, but that the
presumption is that we have a plan. I also (based on my conversations with Shoshi who actually has read the literature)
said that there is literature that disaster recovery should be tied to a long term plan than made and makes sense apart
from the disaster response — and that we did not need to reinvent the wheel. Sounds like you can expect more help.
