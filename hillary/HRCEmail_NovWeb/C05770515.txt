Forgot - he also told me if we didn't like AG's statement (I had objected y'day), we should take a look at Moussa's after
he saw us. I haven't seen it, boarding a plane. He also said AG did not use the word 'lacking' - not found in the Arabic.

      called me early today, when I was at the airport. He wanted to say they don't understand our opposition.




                                                     and with September looming I predicted there would be no interest
in spending time on an exercise that will not yield results.

I also asked that no matter where we were on the 29th, we wanted an outcome that reflected support for direct talks.
This provoked a long complaint about how difficult these meetings were
             said we needed                                                                 but to take the floor.
