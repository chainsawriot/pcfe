Cheryl and Jake,

I wanted to pass along my profound thanks for your support of this week's Civil Society Summit. The response has been
extraordinary. The Summit as a whole generated 14.5 million Twitter impressions and was the top political Tweet of the
day on Wednesday. The Town Hall was by far the largest broadcasting event in IIP's memory — three times bigger than
the runner up. We've also received excellent reports from the many ambassadors and embassies that held viewing
parties, superb reviews from civil society reps in scores of countries, and even strong praise from Members of Congress
when I testified on the Hill yesterday. None of this would have been possible without your continuing support. Along
with vast numbers of our friends in the non-governmental world, I am grateful.

Thanks and enjoy the weekend,
Tomicah
