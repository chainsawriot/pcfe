Madam Secretary,

Thank you! I thought it went very well, and your remarks at the press conference were great. Don Gips and his team
were incredible, and really helped push forward the deliverables, which showed real substantive progress on a number
of areas of the relationship. And though perhaps not the biggest deliverable, I thought that the announcement of the
opportunity grants program to help South African students study in the U.S. was something special (but I may be partial
to it since Meghann and ECA helped make it happen).

And I just heard that your speech in Cape Town was amazing! I hope the rest of the trip goes well.

Next up on the strategic dialogues agenda - and last one for the year - is Indonesia (in DC in September).

Best,
Mike

Dear Mike--

I didn't get the chance to thank you for how well the Dialogue turned out. I know it was a difficult journey, but we got
there!
And it wouldn't have happened w/o your leadership of the process.
Thanks for all you do--H
