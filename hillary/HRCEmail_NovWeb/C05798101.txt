I truly, truly hope that you can do this. It's more important than any invitation from me, as it is the last Baccalaureate of
Shirley's tenure as the first woman president of Princeton. She has transformed the institution in so many ways and this
would be such a great way to start her final graduation ceremony. You may remember when WJC did Class Day, which is
also an important part of our final ceremonies; he had a big impact. The Baccalaureate address is generally more serious
and really the closest thing we have to having a graduation speaker, as we have no speaker other than the president (of
the university) for the graduation ceremony itself. It is done in the chapel, with all seniors in the building and all the
parents who can't fit in outside watching on screens. When I was dean I always found it to be one of the most moving
ceremonies of the year (also fabulously multi-denominational).

I have my fingers firmly crossed; this would mean a great deal. Although to be honest, I have to admit that if I succeed in
being the next president of Princeton (I am firmly in the running), this will definitely not be the LAST time I urge you to
come visit and speak!

Best,
AM

Good morning, Anne-Marie,
Attached is a pdf of the letter from Shirley to Hillary Clinton. Would you also like us to get the original, hard copy to you?
Thanks for your help.
