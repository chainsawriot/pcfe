  I don't want to bother the Secretary and hope she is doing okay. Even NFL players usually take two weeks to come
back from concussions so she is in good company.




  Anyway, I hope you have a really nice Christmas and enjoy some time off. I would also be interested in hearing about
what you plan to do next. Take care and give my best to HRC. Dennis
