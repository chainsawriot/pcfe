Subject:                          North Korea Update


Madame Secretary, given your pre-tapings later this morning, I want to keep you updated on emerging activity regarding
North Korea. Later today we plan to announce Steve Bosworth's travel to the region for consultations in Seoul, Beijing
and Tokyo. While he is on an airplane early this morning, we will hold the announcement until after you do the Sunday
shows. It is nonetheless possible that you will get a question on North Korea. I have received questions at the podium
the past two days about the discovery of the light-water reactor and have reaffirmed the need for North Korea to meet
its international obligations and follow through on its commitments under the 2005 joint statement to denuclearize. We
do anticipate there will be additional information emerging later today regarding activity of concern behind that project.
Jim talked with David Sanger of the NYT yesterday afternoon at the White House to appropriately shape a story we
expect to hit the web around dinnertime tonight. Again, we expect this to break after your pre-tapings. Jim can go over
what he told Sanger if you need it prior to the taping.




Steve will be staked out throughout his trip and we have assigned our Hub director in Tokyo to meet him in Seoul and
help him navigate through the media thicket throughout his trip. I do not expect Steve to do much more than emphasize
our consultations in whatever public encounters he may have.




PJ
