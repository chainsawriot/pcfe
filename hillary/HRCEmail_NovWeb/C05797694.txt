Dear All
Please see the photo below of a street in NLR recently renamed by Mayor Pat Hays. Dorothy Rodham Way intersects
with Virginia Kelley Drive. Mayor Hays has been working on this for a while and plans in the spring to install a bench as
well as some plantings, etc. He is very excited about this and asked me to please let HRC, WJC, and CVC know ASAP.
Also a Dem Gaz photog took some photos this afternoon as the sign was was installed this morning. Mayor Hays also
asked to please pass along his best wishes to HRC for a speedy recovery. Please also tell her that all of her friends and
Foundation staff in LR are keeping her in our thoughts and prayers. I'll send a few more photos in a separate email.
Best
SSS
