Subject: Iraqiyya walks out of 1st Iraq parliament session (SBU)

(U) A Sunni-backed coalition walked out of Iraq's parliament session in protest, before a vote on the presidency, media
report. Coalition leader Allawi and the parliament speaker joined the walkout, which appeared designed to show the bloc's
power. The lawmakers demanded that before parliament vote on the president, it vote to formally end the de-
Baathification program purging former members of Saddam Hussein's ruling party. Their demand was rejected. The
parliament session continued in their absence. The vote for the presidency is a necessary step before a new government
can be formed, under a deal forged November 10 that keeps Prime Minister Maliki in power.
