Dear PDAS Smith,

I hope that I have the right person, and that this e-mail finds you well. I am sorry to bother you with it, and I've certainly
never written the author of an article before, but I felt that I had to write you after reading your article in The Atlantic
today. I think many woman in the State Department are going to be passing it around, showing each other that,
whatever we choose for "it" to be, we can have it.




Again, I'm sorry for taking up your time and I apologize for the slight rambling, but I really just wanted to say thank you
so much for sharing your opinion, and want you to know that woman across all bureaus and offices in State are reading
it and realizing that the mythical work-life balance isn't so mythical at all.

 Stay well and happy 4th of July!

 Sincerely,
     UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05791091 Date: 11/30/2015
