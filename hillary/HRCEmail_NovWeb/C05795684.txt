This is simply painfully honest on her part and a moment in time where Higher Purpose shines a bright light on Higher
Ground...Higher Ground is where all great solutions and triumphs are found and scaled...HRC-once again is taking people
there-whether they ever thought they ever want to go there or not...

This op-ed in the Boston Herald is amazing - all the more so because it comes from a former critic of hers:




An apology to Hillary



Drying tears again, resilient Clinton proves true leader

At Andrews Air Force Base on Friday, a military band played "Nearer, My God, to Thee." Marines in dress uniforms
carried to four black hearses the flag-draped caskets of the Americans, including Winchester native Glen Doherty, killed
at our consulate in Libya. President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton led the solemn ceremony, Clinton
speaking before him.

"If the last few days teach us anything, let it be this: that this work and the men and women who risk their lives to do it
are at the heart of what makes America great and good," said Clinton, her voice at times uneven with emotion for the
dead men she had employed.

Then she said: "So we will wipe away our tears, stiffen our spines, and face the future undaunted."

It was a perfect line for America and for Americans who try to keep peace in a smoldering Middle East. It was a line, too,
that captured — unwittingly or not — how Clinton has lived her life. How many times since this woman took center
stage in this country nearly 20 years ago has she, privately and publicly, wiped away her tears, stiffened her spine, and
faced the future undaunted.

Clinton appeared to be crying again as she listened to Obama, seeming stricken himself. And when Obama finished and
walked back behind the podium, Clinton reached for his hand like an older sister or even a mother, and held it for a
second or two. It was a moment the history books will remember.

There was the first black president on the verge of re-election, or not. There was the woman expected to be the first
female president, until he showed up out of nowhere. There was the rivalry and tortured history, Bill Clinton ever the
third actor in the shadows. But all of it was put aside for something bigger than politics or egos: their country. We don't
see enough of that anymore.

When her husband was president, I made a career out of trashing Hillary Clinton's hairdos, pantsuits, her attempted
health care coup, her right-wing conspiracy theories, her staying with that slippery serial philanderer. Four years ago in
the presidential primary I rooted for Obama over her.

Yet when she finally conceded a totally unexpected defeat, a different Hillary Clinton began to emerge. She surprised us
by accepting a consolation prize, secretary of state. She then went on to perform it so ably that nearly two-thirds of
Americans, an almost unprecedented percentage, approve of her and her rehabilitated — or so we hope — spouse.

More than once since 2008 I've wondered: Would she have done a better job than Obama? I don't know. But I do know I
sold this woman short.

In awful moments in history, some leaders rise to the occasion, and some don't. Think Ronald Reagan's reassurance
after the Challenger disaster. Or George Bush on the rubble of Ground Zero after 9/11, telling the world we'd never
forget. Friday, by comparison, was a tiny moment. Still, Hillary Clinton rose to meet it.

I like "her trademark combination of resolve, empathy, and hyper competence".
