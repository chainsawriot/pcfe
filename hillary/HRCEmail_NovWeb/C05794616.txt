Kim--

It was great seeing you, albeit briefly, yesterday, and I would like to see you as soon as our schedules mesh. So I'm
copying Cheryl Mills and Lona to see if we can meet next week while you're in DC. Looking forward to meeting w you, H

Dear Hillary,

It was wonderful to see you yesterday briefly with Jill at the NY Women's Foundation Event. Your remarks about your
mother and the role of kindness in the world were incredibly inspiring. The more I hear you speak in different contexts
the more I think our philosophies on life and women are so very aligned on many levels. I also enjoyed the privilege of
being in China last week on the Women and Philanthropy portion of the US Delegation. So much interesting learning
came from that trip and I thought your remarks with Madame Liu were so very appropriate and well delivered.

Since we last saw each other around Women in the World, I have been spending a lot of time thinking about "the way
forward," as you aptly put it, drawing on what I have seen in law (at Latham), business (at Avon), philanthropy (at
Goldman) and now in the media with Tina. I do think there is a moment here that can be seized for women if we look at
the pieces of the puzzle - or the legs of the stool - a bit differently and seek to identify the best constellation that will
provide the strongest leverage points for women today. I believe all the elements are there but we may need to
assemble them a bit differently, which requires an understanding of the tools at hand, a deep appreciation for the past
and a willingness to be creative about the future.

Of course, over email these thoughts sound very general and It would be so wonderful to get together to talk specifics
and share some ideas with you. I have not heard from Lona in the past several weeks and can only imagine from what I
read in the press how incredibly busy you are, but wanted to let you know that I am in NY this weekend and coming to
DC Tuesday for an event with you at State on IM Pei if you happen to have any cancellations in your schedule. I am then
off to Mongolia, but can try again through Lona to get on your calendar for June or July.

Again, it was so wonderful seeing you yesterday and do hope we get a chance to explore some ideas about what is
possible. I do truly feel the moment could be upon us.

With deep admiration,

Kim
