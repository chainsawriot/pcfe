Subject: Sister Maya...

Minnie, I'll always remember going to her home near Wake Forest the day prior to her hosting the Bosslady on
campus... and she popped that champagne at Noon and we went to town... working, of course, Madam
Secretary. ... I acted out my favorite line of hers in all her movies... in "How to Make an American Quilt"...
she told Wynona Ryder... "I call this, darling, 'where love resides..." I nailed it!!

Today's reflection:

"While I know myself as a creation of God, I am also obligated to realize and remember that everyone else and
everything else are also God's creation." --Maya Angelou

This is ever so important when we come across those who do not look like us, who hold different views from
us, and those who even hate us. By acknowledging the createdness of others, we are able to affirm that in each
person there is an inalienable human dignity. And it is from here where problems can be resolved, compromise
can begin, and where peace has a chance to grow. â€” Faith & Politics Institute
