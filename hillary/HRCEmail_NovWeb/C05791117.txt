Subject: Italy/Syria

Sandro deBernadino called my cell this morning under instructions from his minister to ask that Italy be included in any
meeting being arranged with Russia. They had heard meeting would be P5, AL and EU. Sandro enumerated all that Italy
was doing, all it's interests and that criteria for meeting should be clear. I told him that if meeting happens, and we
hoped it would, that Special Envoy Annan for UN and AL would determine participation. We understood it would be
small to focus on outcomes and not be a large conference event. I thanked him for all that Italy is doing to help and
urged them to be in direct touch with Special Envoy and his office. He returned to his points several times and I pointed
him to the Special Envoy. He finally said they would do that and also said he hoped if we gave advice we would include
Italy. He also asked that I pass message to the Secretary. Jake, please let S know. Thanks all.
