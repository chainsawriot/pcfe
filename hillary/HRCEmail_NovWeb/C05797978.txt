Thank you.for yesterday and all the work you have put into to getting us through yesterday.

As a testament to how super human I think you are, I asked tonite at dinner why you weren't
doing 9 other things and what you were up to instead b/c I have come to believe there is
little you can't do.

Seriously - thank you for helping her be the best she can be.

And me be better than I am.
