Didn't see any urgent follow-up. Menon has a call in to me for tomorrow morning, and will let you know if there's
anything further.

Congratulations on New START ratification. This would not have happened without your personal push, and it's a great
way to end the year.

All best,

Bill

Madam Secretary,

Couple quick points:

1. Know you're scheduled to speak to FM Krishna later this morning.




2. Will do monthly SVTC with Baghdad this morning, with Pat and Jim J and teams on both Baghdad and State sides.
