Subject: S-Mikati mtg: urgent request

In case there's not a prestige with S:
The Lebanese Perm Rep called just now to ask that S request a brief 1 on 1 with Mikati at the end of the bilat.
                                                                            We do not know what he wants to raise in
the 1 on 1.
                                The BCL does not/not suggest that she do so, but just as a reminder of his sensitivities
from last year. Beth
