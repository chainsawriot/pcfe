Indian man beheads daughter in rage over lifestyle

—By PRAKASH BHANDARI I Associated Press – 7 hrs ago

JAIPUR, India (AP) — Police say a man upset over his daughter's lifestyle chopped her head off with a sword
and then paraded it through his village before surrendering to authorities in western India.

Marble miner Ogad Singh's 20-year-old daughter had been living with her parents in the Rajasthani village of
Dungarji after leaving her husband two years ago.

Police Superintendent Umesh Ojha says Singh was upset by his daughter having affairs With men, and became
enraged when she eloped with one of them two weeks ago.

Ojha says Singh forced her to return home Sunday, and beheaded her Monday with a sword.

Rapidly modernizing India faces increasing social clashes as youths resist traditions like arranged marriage or
limits on women venturing outside their parents' or husbands' homes.
