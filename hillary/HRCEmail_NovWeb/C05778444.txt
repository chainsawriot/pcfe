Works for me. I am just arriving at the Gridiron dinner so tomorrow morning is probably better.

I think this is very classy and would not change a word.

Heads up that S will call you tonight or tomorrow am.0

On leave â€” come to find out from Pat (and HR as well) PAS don't earn or accrue leave so my inclination is to go with the 4
weeks we discussed unless that does not work for you.

We can discuss in detail.

True, but you are one of my favorite lawyers (Harold is a Red Sox fan so I am partial there too) and if something hits you
as a sour note, good to know. I noodled it much of the day but may be too close to it.

I will review and revert with any suggestions but ultimately feel this is your statement to make.

We will not put S statement out until Sunday at lpm.

Can you put any text edits in draft I sent you?

Thanks.

I will be chased all afternoon after the Secretary's statement is posted. Rather than answer 40 calls, I would ask that the
attached be sent to the bullpen either immediately before or after her statement. I would welcome any thoughts on it.
Thanks.
