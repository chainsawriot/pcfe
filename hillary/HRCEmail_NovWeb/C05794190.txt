I am so sorry about the State Department officer killed in Libya and the ongoing precariousness in Egypt and Libya. Such
anathema to us as Americans - and a painful reminder or how long it took modernism to take root in the US, after the
Enlightenment, the 14th, 15th, 16th 19th amendments, removal of censorship norms and laws, etc.
Heading to bed to read. A strange day here. Another bright blue beautiful chilly September 11th.
Much to discuss when we can talk, hopefully tomorrow?

Because of attacks on our embassy in Cairo and our office in Benghazi so email when you can talk.
