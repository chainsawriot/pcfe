 Subject: Update 3 on incident involving ConGen Peshawar vehicle

 Colleagues,

 Embassy Islamabad provided the following update on the attack in Peshawar:

    -     Post characterizes the incident as a vehicle-borne suicide attack. There has been no claim of responsibility yet.
    -     The vehicle attacked was a Chief of Mission motorcade movement en route to pick up COM personnel from
          their homes in the University Town neighborhood of Peshawar.
          Post continues to report the following casualties: two wounded American officers now being treated in
          Islamabad, two locally engaged staff being treated in PeshaWar. Post has received conflicting reports about the
          possible number of injured Pakistani police and/or bystanders.
          Pakistani press continues to report two bystanders killed in the attack and up to 19 total persons (including the
          Americans) injured.
          Pakistan's MFA has just released the statement below condemning the attack.
          All COM personnel are accounted for.

 Thank you, regards,

                            Pakistan strongly condemns the bomb attack on US personnel


The Government of Pakistan strongly condemns the bomb attack on US personnel working in their Consulate in Peshawar.
The attack against diplomats is a despicable act and cannot be condoned by any rationale.

 2. The Government will conduct full investigation of the case and would spare no effort to bring the individuals behind
this crime to justice as soon as possible.

 Further to the alert on the attack on a ConGen Peshawar vehicle, the Consulate confirms two Chief of Mission personnel
 suffered non-life-threatening injuries. The two employees are
                                 Both are receiving medical treatment in Peshawar and will be transferred over land to
