So Team,
I didn't get a chance to discuss this on the phone because frankly I was exhausted from being up all night. But I wanted
to make sure HRC and WJC is aware since David is a former DNC staffer and a huge supporter of them both.

I was received a call from his mom on yesterday asking if I could go over to Howard Hospital to figure out what was
going on with him because his girlfriend and rec'd a call from a detective.

On Thursday evening David attended a tennis tournament En route home, he dropped by his neighborhood 7-11 to pick
up a few items.

While there, he was subject to a random act of violence due to robbery.

David sustained trauma to the head and continues to be in critical, but stable condition at Howard University. He is in
ICU.

The doctors are cautiously optimistic. His mother wanted me to be sure and let both the Clinton's were aware.

His mother and brother are both in town and at his beside along with his girlfriend Tina.

PS.. Capricia we are working to get him moved to GW.

Sylvia Mercer (Mom)
