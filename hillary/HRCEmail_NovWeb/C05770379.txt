Would not be crazy to tack Pakistan onto our next trip to the Middle East

As much as Jake and I would love you to go to Pakistan (you had to know this was coming) as a way to show support,
we're assuming that's not in the cards. (We'd be thrilled though to be wrong, it's a helluva PD
opportunity.)

Absent you, we think you should *send* Raj on your behalf. AID is technically the lead, and he like in Haiti, could
probably help speed things along on the ground. He's up for going but only if you are 100% ok with the idea.

Jake and I think it's a distant second on our wish list, but it's the next best thing and he should definitely go.
