I just spoke to Nathan Brown. His analysis/understanding so far (and he's still analyzing this obviously) useful
in terms of piecing this together:

--PA dissolved immediately

--obviously, constituent assembly (and clearly the constitutional process), in jeopardy, if not already OBE'ed

--SCAF has legislative/decree authority till a new parliament elected

--when a new president comes into office, he rules by decree, using powers either of constitutional declaration
(see below) or a renewal of the 1971 constitution with the articles approved in the March 2011 referendum
patched in

--constitutional declaration stays in force till a new constitution is issued (the process is unclear given today's
ruling); no provisions in constit declaration on process for re-running parliamentary elections, so timing, etc. not
clear

--the key point is that both the 1971 constitution and the constitutional declaration have very few checks on
executive power (the central problem in the Egyptian political system for decades)

--without a parliament in place, there is no way for parliament to challenge the validity of the Ministry of
Justice decree on military powers (the soft introduction of martial law)

Democratic transition is over for now. Could be revived if Morsy wins, but he'd have excessive powers, so the
democratic framework of his rule at the outset would be lacking. Could be revived if there is a fair
parliamentary elections process â€” but what mechanisms would guarantee that when there would be no
opposition or pluralism with the state structures and no mechanism to create a democratic election law except
by decree? He's dubious.

--Even if Shafiq wins and appoints a diverse cabinet, there is no (apparent) check on executive power if the
above documents are used as the legal framework.

--MB's reaction seems very passive so far, they seem to be negotiating with the SCAF and Shafik and seem
extremely worried about avoiding a mass crackdown, so may just hunker down and try to avoid an
confrontation (this would also take the wind out of any democratization sails, as where would the organized
pressure for change come from?)
