We have all been focused over these past few weeks on the NGO issue, and it is a matter of serious continuing concern
for the United States. But it is also important to underscore that the United States remains committed to a strong
bilateral relationship with Egypt. Despite the recent strains, and differences on certain issues, the fundamentals of this
strategic relationship remain strong. We continue to work together to protect regional peace and security and to
address the full range of regional issues before us. The United States is committed to supporting the transition to
democracy in Egypt, and we welcome the progress that has been made by Egypt in conducting free elections for both
houses of Parliament. The United States is also committed to ensuring Egypt's economic and financial stability. In this
regard, the United States continues to support the efforts of the IMF to conclude an economic reform and stabilization
program with Egypt and remains in close touch with other donors on ways to assist the Egyptian economy. The United
States and Egypt have been close partners for many decades, and we look forward to a close partnership for many
decades to come.
