Dear Cheryl,

It is for me a great honor to be on this team. I want to thank all of you for the dedication that has made this
project a success. I would like to thank you, personally, Cheryl, fot411 your support to the project.

Please, extend my thanks to the Secretary of State for having mentioned me. I suspect some members of this
team to have suggested it and I'm grateful to them also.

We still have a lot of challenges ahead. Let's keep up the good work!

Best,

Michael
