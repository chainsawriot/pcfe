Japan's and Korea's agreeing to a Foreign Minister Trilat in NY is very good news. Both mentioned it is the US turn to
host. The Koreans proposed agenda is consistent with our goal of showing the world we can continue to work on issues
of mutual interest (DPRK, SCS etc) despite Japan Korea tensions.

We'd like to proceed with logistical arrangements with the two sides to nail down a time, agenda etc. Is that OK?

More from ROKG and Choe, who subsequently called me. I told him GOJ willing to do the trilat but no dates or agenda
topics offered by them yet. He fully understood imperative of close 3-way coordination on agenda and logistics, and no
press engagement until all sides are in agreement.

He asked for feedback on their proposed notional agenda and logistical suggestions. I said we would be reviewing these,
but that scheduling and other related issues would be handled from 7th floor in coord with EAP. Doing on the 24th
seems impossible and unrealistic, the 25th as well.

I confirmed to him that we would "host" and would be drawing from Cambodia agenda to develop an appropriate
agenda for this session....in close coord with ROKG and Gal. He reminded that their POCs in NY will handle all
arrangements, and asked for our schedulers to be in direct touch with them. See Choe's earlier email for their
coordinates.

I indicated we would update them on D(B) schedule when we can.

bear Mr. Rapson,

Following is our proposal for the time&venue, public announcement and agenda:

1. TIME & VENUE
The time and venue for the meeting should be fixed, at the earliest possible time, by the mission in
New York. Again, we would like to have the meeting either 24th(Mon.) or 25th(Tue.)

2. ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE TRILATERAL
We would like to explain the purpose of the trilateral as "part of the regular trilateral
foreign ministers' meetings to discuss regional issues, North Korea, global challenges etc"
This public announcement should be made simultaneously, at a time agreed upon by the three countries.

3. AGENDA
For the ROK, the ROK-US -Japan's trilateral cooperation, North Korea/North Korean nuclear issue,
regional situation(Japan-China relations, South China Sea, Myanmar etc.) and global issues
(Iran nuclear issue, Syria, Libya etc) could be included in the agenda.

We would like to know your thoughts and ideas about these.

Also, could you tell me the arrival and departure date for Dep. Secretary Burns in New York?
How long will he stay in NY?
Choe, Hyoung-chan
Minister Counselor(political section)
Embassy of the Republic of Korea
