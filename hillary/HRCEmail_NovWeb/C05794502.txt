Subject: Tunis Still Serious

Still a bad situation. Undetermined number of protesters (embassy estimates between 50 and 300,
but hard to get a count) are roaming the compound looting and setting fires. They have set fire to a
dumpster and pushed it up against the chancery. At this point we do not think that is a serious
problem but it's indicative of the protesters' intentions. No sign of weapons on protesters. Local
police/military are struggling to control protesters outside the compound but are not present on the
compound.

All staff remain in the chancery. No injuries.
