 RE: Seminal Events/ Decisions/Moments


     1. February 16, 2009 -- Our first wheels down overseas. Began the arduous path to restore
        credibility with our allies and relationships around the world. Started the path to 100+
        countries, with each stop proving our administration is writing a new chapter on US
        diplomacy.

     2. Arab Spring 2011 — HRC played critical role in building the coalition of nations to topple
        Gaddafi in Libya. Continues to work tirelessly to shore up support for emerging
        democracies in the region.

     3. January 13, 2009 — Testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The first
        time that (almost) Secretary of State drew the connection between the role of women and
        their integral connection to strategic policy decisions. Has made the rights of women not
        only a moral issue but also foreign policy imperative.

     4. Late 2009 — Afghanistan, played an integral part of the national security team making
        decisions regarding the country including the 2009 troop surge and the eventual draw
        down in the region.

     5. May 2012 — China and Chen Guangcheng. True test of diplomacy and negotiations, all
        the while moving forward with the Strategic and Economic Dialogue meetings. Even in
        the middle of a diplomatic crisis, reiterating the focus on the pivot to Asia.

     6. November 2011 — Breakthrough with Burma. First visit from SOS in 50+ years with
        incredible images including the ASSK meeting, opening the door to country oppressed
        for decades.

     7. December 2011 -- LGBT speech in Geneva, a culmination of all of the changes HRC has
        made within the State Department to advance LGBT rights through policies at State -
        domestic benefits, transgendered and passports, etc. (And personally, one of the proudest
        moments I have ever had working for her, listening to her speech in the hall in Geneva.)

     8. July 2012 — Apology to Pakistan. Whether or not this is a seminal moment remains to be
        seen — however, given the rock bottom situation we found ourselves in late last year, the
        apology gives us a chance to restart the dialogue with Pakistan.
