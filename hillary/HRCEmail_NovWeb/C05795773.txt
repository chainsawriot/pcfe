      Draft 5/8/12                                                           RELEASE IN FULL



                     A Vision for a World Food Stewardship Council:
                        Addressing the World's Major Food Crises

                                      Kelly D. Brownell, Ph.D.
                                          Yale University



              Three major food crises threaten the world's ability to cope. Hunger and
      undernutrition, obesity/overnutrition, and unsustainable food production practices raise
      pressing questions about human rights, catastrophic health care costs, national security,
      global political stability, and the health of the planet.

              The world's population will reach 9.1 billion by 2050, an increase of 34%, most
      of which will occur in developing countries where undernutrition, overweight, and
      environmental issues form a triple burden[1]. Global demand for food is expected to
      increase by 70% at a time when crops are used increasingly for bioenergy and industrial
      purposes and stresses on arable land are extreme[1]. Proceeding with the status quo will
      lead to highly undesirable outcomes, including regional and global instability

              There is the need for an immediate, far-reaching, non-partisan effort to address
      both short-term and long-term issues with food on a global basis. This paper presents a
      vision for the creation of a World Food Stewardship Council. The Council, if adequately
      funded and both backed and managed by highly trusted individuals and organizations,
      could assemble relevant stakeholders, coordinate efforts across business, private, and
      government sectors, undertake strategic research, and provide guidance to a world in
      need of solutions.

                                  Food Crises in a World Context

               The world has long recognized hunger and food insecurity as major global issues
      [2-4]. More than 1 billion people worldwide are undernourished, with numbers much
      larger if deficiencies in nutrients such as iron and Vitamin A are considered. Further,
      rates of deficiencies have risen in recent years due to instability in world food prices and
      economic conditions generally[2]. The combination of macronutrient, micronutrient, and
      calorie insufficiency leads to negative effects on every organ system in the body, poverty,
      educational disadvantage, and far-reaching political consequences. Children, adolescents,
      and pregnant women being especially vulnerable.

              Newer on the scene is obesity. Considerable human suffering, extreme health care
      costs, and high prevalence (1.5 billion people are overweight) make overnutrition a
      pressing global issue. The World Health Organization estimates that 65% of the world's




                                                                                          1

      population live in countries where overweight kills more people than does underweight
      [5].

              Modern food production and consumption patterns are of concern not only to
      human health but to the ability of the planet to survive. The loss of arable land, shrinking
      biodiversity, depletion of water supplies, the heavy use of petroleum resources for
      industrial farming, and climate change are but a few relevant issues. By 2025 for
      instance, 2/3 of the world's population will be affected by serious stress on water
      supplies; 70% of water is used for agriculture[6]. Animal agriculture, which draws
      heavily on finite resources such as water and oil, and leads to emissions of carbon
      dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, now surpasses transport as a contributor to global
      warming[7].

              These three areas can be seen as corners of a triangle, where each of the areas
      intersects with the others, and where there is potential for seeking common ground but
      also for conflict and working at cross-purposes (Figure 1).

               The health of individuals is at stake, but also the health of the environment,
       whether economies can thrive, and the political fates of countries. As example, one could
       readily imagine countries coming to serious conflict over the water in a shared lake or
       river, countries making heavy use of natural resources in food production being

      sanctioned by world bodies, and even more vast numbers of people dying from food-
      related problems. These daunting outcomes may seem distant, but could arise in a few
      decades.

                                   Who Tends to These Issues?

              Each of the three world food concerns is addressed by government agencies,
      NG0s, scientific experts, bodies of research and reports, and global organizations such as
      the Food and Agriculture Organization, World Health Organization, and World Bank.
      Coordination or integration of efforts across parties is inadequate given the magnitude of
      the problems, resources are inadequate and splintered, few opportunities exist to examine
      how policies and practices affect all three problems, and in some cases the players square
      off on controversial issues.

              There are numerous examples of how progress in one area can be considered a
      problem in others. The use of genetically modified foods and petroleum based fertilizers
      that have led to food production increases in poor countries as part of the Green
      Revolution raises questions about impacts on biodiversity and the environment. Experts
      in the obesity field have proposed that SNAP benefits (food stamps) in the US not be
      used to buy sugar-sweetened beverages, a policy opposed by many in the anti-hunger
      community[8]. Because parts of the food system are affected by changes in others, there
      is need for cooperation, coordination, and ingenuity that creates wins across all areas.

             In 1974, the United Nations General Assembly voted to create a World Food
      Council, a separate UN organization designed primarily to deal with hunger and
      malnutrition. Lack of funding, questions about authority, and difficulties with other UN
      organizations such as the FAO led to the demise of the World Food Council in 1993. The
      duties were absorbed into the FAO.

              In 1974, the UN created the Administrative Committee on Coordination
      Subcommittee on Nutrition whose task it was to address hunger and malnutrition by
      coordinating activities across UN agencies. This evolved to the present day UN Standing
      Committee on Nutrition (UNSCN) whose primary task still involves malnutrition. It is a
      committee that reports to a committee, issues reports, and does outreach to nutrition
      practitioners globally.

             Existing organizations play an important role, but food crises remain and more
      must be done. Creating a new organization outside existing structures, but connected to
      them, may offer the best hope for progress.


                                A World Food Stewardship Council

      The Vision
            A call is hereby issued for the creation of a World Food Stewardship Council
      whose mandate is to: a) Convene world leaders, experts and other stakeholders with the



                                                                                                 3

      aim of solving world food problems; b) Develop solutions that simultaneously address
      these problems; c) Act as an integrative body to keep relevant parties informed of
      developments; d) Commission and support strategic research projects that fill key gaps in
      knowledge; e) Develop model policies; 1) Work with world leaders to have policies
      implemented and evaluated.

              The creation of a World Food Stewardship Council could provide an opportunity
      for much needed dialogue between areas, but only if key stakeholders (the very top
      leaders in different sectors) agree to convene. Dialogue is just the one step toward the
      goal of healthy, vital people living on a healthy planet. The Council would work with
      global leaders to identify the most pressing issues, collect the necessary background
      information, assemble experts, carry out or support any needed research, issue reports,
      and follow through with all stakeholders in the service of insuring maximal reach and
      impact.

      Structure, Governance, and Issues
              Governance of the Council would have representation from six key communities
      (Figure 2): 1) Public health & science; 2) Funding organizations (e.g., foundations) and
      groups with global reach; 3) Relevant global agencies such as FAO, WHO, World Bank,
      WTO, etc.; 4) Industry; 5) Finance and Economics; and 6) NGOs that represent the three
      areas. The overriding spirit would be to nurture a non-partisan effort where real efforts
      would be made to solve real problems.

              A Governing Board comprised of the six groups depicted in Figure 2 would help
      establish priorities, coordinate fundraising, and work closely with Council staff to insure
      projects are carried out capably and expeditiously. This board, because of its visibility
      and prestige, would also be instrumental in coordinating with world leaders to get input
      and to insure impact.

              The principles underlying governance are involvement of relevant stakeholders,
      equity across stakeholders, low likelihood that any one stakeholder could hijack the
      process, a non-partisan process, avoidance of conflicts of interest, and solutions created
      by input from creative and visionary individuals.

               Housing such an organization within the United Nations would seem reasonable
      at first glance, as the UN has a global governance structure in place and has existing
      organizations in place that deal with food and health issues (FAO, WHO, UNSCN). UN
      agencies, however, can get buffeted by political winds, have funding limitations, and can
      be hampered by internal disputes over authority.

               There are dozens of examples of issues that might be tackled. The Council could
       address how world trade policy affects food and nutrition issues, how agriculture
       subsidies affect the world food supply and prices, how climate change will shift where
       specific crops are grown, how to protect the environment while feeding the world, how
       forest protection is affected by heavy cultivation of crops such as oil palm, barriers to
       food distribution, food marketing, to name just a few issues.



                                                                                                    4

              Not all problems will be solved. There will be areas where stakeholders cannot
      agree. There will be cases where solutions will be proposed but not implemented. Yet, it
      is essential to try.

      Funding and Leadership
               Funding and help with development of a leadership team would best come from
      institutions and foundations known for global scope, vision, and bipartisanship. Examples
      would be the Gates Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, Bloomberg Foundation,
      Wellcome Trust. Other stakeholders would not be in a position to fund such efforts (e.g.,
      scientists) or might be seen as having vested interests (e.g., industry).

       Threats
               Several threats could make a World Food Stewardship Council impossible to
       launch or might create a weak organization without reach or impact. Perceived or actual
       partisanship would undermine credibility and discourage key players from taking part.
       Lack of funding would minimize reach. Unless high profile leaders from different sectors


                                                                                                 5

      took part, the stature, visibility, and significance of the Council would be reduced. Above
      all, the spirit of urgency, cooperation, and working toward meaningful solutions must be
      present or the effort would be strangled by competing interests.

                                              Su mma ry

              There is a pressing need to address global food issues in ways that lead to more
      than reports and conferences — there must be solutions. The creation of a World Food
      Stewardship Council is proposed as a step in this direction. With the right governance,
      staffing, funding, visibility, and stature, the Council could play an important role in
      addressing major world food issues.
