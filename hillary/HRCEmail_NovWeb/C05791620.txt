Subject: Assad's fall only matter of time: outgoing UN mission chief (Reuters)

OSLO (Reuters) - It is just a matter of time before the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad falls,
General Robert Mood, outgoing head of the U.N. monitoring mission in Syria, said July 27.
   "In my opinion it is only a matter of time before a regime that is using such heavy military power and
disproportional violence against the civilian population is going to fall," the Norwegian general, who left
Damascus on July 19, told Reuters.
