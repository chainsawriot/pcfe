According to State Human Resources, as of 9/30/12 the total number of State Department employees is 69,885

Breakdown:

•   Foreign Service (FS) Employees: 13,774 (7,980 Generalists; — 5,794 Specialists)
•   Civil Service (CS) Employees: 10,760
•   Locally Employed Staff: 45,351

According to Pat, these figures do not include USAID's 9,000 person global workforce. While AID reports to the
Secretary, it is considered a distinct entity. Same with OPIC, MCC. When you include USAID and all USG personnel
under Chief of Mission Authority, the number shoots way up.
