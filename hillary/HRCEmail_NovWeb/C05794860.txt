I'm enroute to Jordan but wanted you to know that the last day of the WPS Inst at Wellesley was very wonderful and
truly inspirational, as so many of the participants spoke of their positive experiences. There were many grateful
shoutouts to the Honorable Hillary. You clearly were the highlight of their time there. They are an accomplished group of
emerging leaders and we will be hearing more about them in the future. Jane made the announcement about Wilson
and hiring Rangita who did an incredible job with the training. I intend to see two of the Jordanian MPs who were in the
program in Amman. On to the next installment!

I'm doing a strategic civil society dialogue with women from the region starting tonight. I'm sure to get an unvarnished
vlew.
