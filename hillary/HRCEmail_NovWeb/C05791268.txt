"Hugely" happy!
Off to bid farewell to Peres - he said such beautiful things about you throughout the visit - both publicly and privately.

So glad you came down to see Katie â€” most unfortunately we could only stay a bit - had to head up to see Amb Carson
on urgent matter with The Dean of the Dip Corp. I heard she was thrilled to see you! The red velvet cake was fabulous!
