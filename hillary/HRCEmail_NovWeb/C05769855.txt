On a successful Open Skies Treaty Review Conference, with the final document adopted by consensus. The closing day
was not without excitement since the Turks came in with some last-minute demands relating to the Cyprus question,
which would have blocked consensus. Thanks to some quick work by lan Kelly, Diana Marvin and me, we found
formulations to suit both the Greeks and Turks and so, success.

Congratulations to Diana and her hard-working delegation: we are well-launched on the next five years of cooperation
under this important treaty regime, which together with CFE and Vienna Document 99, form the back-bone of the
European conventional arms control system. This success puts in place a positive environment for next week's
consultations on CFE here in Vienna and Moscow.

For Toria Nuland: over to you! Everyone is looking forward to your visit on Monday.

Regards,
RG
