The minister of trade who will be accompanying you in Ghana, Hannah Tettah is a terrific supporter of the AWEP,
our women's entrepreneurship program. She was at the State Dept for AGOA ministerial.

Several years ago, she was in a week-long program I did on women's political participation at
Salzburg. I knew then that she was a rising star.
