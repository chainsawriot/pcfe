Subject:                      a few things



Hillary,

I've been meaning to write you about a few things, but thought it unwise to disturb before the Peace
Talks. And may I say congratulations on all your work leading up to this week and an incredibly
successful start- I feel much more optimistic knowing your role in guiding these efforts.

First, I think there will be a story in the Times ahead of the 6 month anniversary of the bill (they've
been looking for a hook) on how your ideas shaped the bill. The anniversary is 9/23 and there will
be a slew of hopefully popular insurance reforms being implemented as of that day, so there will be a
fair amount of health care news. They've had a hard time nailing down some elements (like the
FEHBP), and so it's not totally fleshed out, but that's the plan as of now.

Second, I know you're going to CFR for a major speech this week. It would be great if you could
come to CAP soon. We're happy to have you for any topic you'd like to make news on. Geithner
came recently to focus on the big middle class tax cut fight we'll have in September, and that worked
well. Our team is especially interested in the unified national security budget, or START, but really
anything you want to make news on would be great.




Again, though things are pretty depressing domestically, it's good to have see bright spots on the
world front, and for that we all owe you thanks.

Neera
