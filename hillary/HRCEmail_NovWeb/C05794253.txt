A new doctrine of intervention?
Washington Post Opinion
Friday, March 30, 7:27 PM
By Henry A. Kissinger

Not the least significant aspect of the Arab Spring is the redefinition of heretofore prevalent principles of foreign policy.
As the United States is withdrawing from military efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan undertaken on the basis (however
disputed) of American national security, it is reengaging in several other states in the region (albeit uncertainly) in the
name of humanitarian intervention. Will democratic reconstruction replace national interest as the lodestar of Middle
East policy? Is democratic reconstruction what the Arab Spring in fact represents?

The evolving consensus is that the United States is morally obliged to align with revolutionary movements in the Middle
East as a kind of compensation for Cold War policies — invariably described as "misguided" — in which it cooperated
with non-democratic governments in the region for security objectives. Then, it is alleged, supporting fragile
governments in the name of international stability generated long-term instability. Even granting that some of those
policies were continued beyond their utility, the Cold War structure lasted 30 years and induced decisive strategic
transformations, such as Egypt's abandonment of its alliance with the Soviet Union and the signing of the Camp David
accords. The pattern now emerging, if it fails to establish an appropriate relationship to its proclaimed goals, risks being
inherently unstable from inception, which could submerge the values it proclaimed.
