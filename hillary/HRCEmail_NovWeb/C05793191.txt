Hi Jake and Phil,                                                                                                     1.4(D)
I know Radek Sikorski pitched S to visit Warsaw before she leaves office, including for a meeting with other FMs in the
region. While his principal motive is to enhance Poland's (                                  !) stature
          in Central and Eastern Europe, there are solid reasons for our interests to justify a visit here:

•   Econ Statecraft: 2013 is a year of rich commercial prospects for US business in Poland, with major tenders coming
    up in nuclear power (worth at least $6B), military helicopters (worth at least $2B), and air/missile defense (worth $5-
    10B). Our principal competitors in all of these are making big pushes at senior levels, most notably during Hollande's
    state visit to Poland two weeks ago, which heavily accented French candidates. S engagement on these issues with
    President, PM Tusk                                  and other senior officials would advance US prospects for       1.4(D)
    success.                                                                                                            1.4(E)
                                                                                                                        B1
•   FTA:                                                                          in any US-EU Free Trade Agreement B5
    negotiations we may decide to launch in 2013; an S visit would
             as well as provide an extraordinary PD platform for building domestic Polish political support for an FTA



•   Democratization: Poland is stepping up as an assistance donor on democratization issues in places like Belarus,
    Ukraine, Tunisia, Burma, etc. An S visit, particularly surrounded with FMs from other newish democracies, would
    help popularize this role for Poland domestically, helping to lead to larger budgets and taking some of the burden off
    of us.

•   Afghanistan: Poles are toying with both follow-on military and development assistance roles post-2014; prospect of
    an S visit would give us leverage to nail down deliverables here during her visit.

Of course my greatest interest of all is in seeing the old team! Hope you can squeeze in a Warsaw stop — it would really
be great to host you.
