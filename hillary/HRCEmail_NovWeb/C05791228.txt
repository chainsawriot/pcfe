Subject: RE: Global Health Diplomacy Office (GHD) in S

I had dinner with Tony Fauci , his wife Christine , Harold Varmus , Francis Collins and Gary Nabel (Director, Vaccine
Institute at NIAID). Great dinner but the conversation stayed on the Oslo speech for >20 minutes. As I had shared with
you how Tony and Peter Piot felt about the speech, but Harold and Francis went on and on about how she defined the
moment in global health and appropriately challenged the global community but at the same time kept the leadership
position for the US. They thought it built on the November speech but brought the challenge ahead front and
center. Really nice comments...just wanted you and 'S' to know.

Eric
