                     EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
                     1. The 2006 elections were a moment of great hope for the DRC, as the country and its people
                        moved out of the shadow of one of the most destructive conflicts the world has known. The
                        international community has invested heavily in the years since. Official development assistance
                        since the end of the post-war transition totals more than $14 billion'. External funding makes
                        up nearly half of the DRC's annual budget2. The UN peacekeeping mission, MONUSCO, costs
                        more than $1 billion a year'. The international financial institutions have buttressed the DRC's
                        economy, most importantly through writing off 4 $12.3 billion debt and granting access to IMF
                        loans. Trade deals, notably the one struck with China', push the aggregate figure up still further.

                     2. Taking stock of progress as the DRC moves through its second post-war electoral cycle is
                        sobering. Investment has not resulted in meaningful change in the lives of ordinary Congolese.
                        The country is now in last place in the annual UNDP development rankings, 187th out of 187
                        countries'. Despite slight improvements, life expectancy and child mortality are below average
                        for the region. National income per capita is less than 50 cents a day7. The DRC will miss all of its
                        Millennium Development Goals. 1.7 million Congolese are displaced', a further 500,000 refugees
                        outside the country'. There are worrying signs of renewed conflict in the East. The investment of
                        billions of dollars has had little impact on the average Congolese citizen.

                     3. The central cause of this suffering is continued insecurity. The Congolese government's inability
                        to protect its people or control its territory undermines progress on everything else. An effective
                        security sector - organized, resourced, trained and vetted - is essential to solving problems
                        from displacement, recruitment of child soldiers and gender-based violence, to economic
                        growth or the trade in conflict minerals. This is not a new finding. The imperative of developing
                        effective military, police and judicial structures has been repeatedly emphasized. Yet, far from
                        showing sustained improvement, Congolese security forces continue posing a considerable
                        threat to the civilian population rather than protecting them'. The recent allegations of an
                        army Colonel leading his troops to engage in widespread rape and looting of villages near Fizi
                        in 2011 underscores the fact that failed military reform can lead to human rights violations".
                        The military - the Forces Armees de la Republique Democratique du Congo (FARDC)- has
                        been accused of widespread involvement in the most serious human rights violations. Police
                        corruption is endemic, and almost any form of judicial protection out of reach for the vast
                        majority'2.

                     4. The root of the failure to implement security sector reform (SSR) is a lack of political will at the
                        highest levels of the Congolese Government. Rather than articulating a vision for Congolese
                        security and marshaling assistance to achieve it, the Government has instead encouraged
                        divisions among the international community and allowed corrupt networks within the security
                        services to flourish, stealing the resources intended to pay basic salaries or profiting from
                        exploitation of natural resources. Unless this is changed, sustainable reform will be impossible.
                        The investment made by Congo's partners could be wasted, and Congo's people will continue to
                        suffer.

                     5. The international community also bears significant responsibility. The DRC's international
                        partners have been politically incoherent and poorly coordinated. Little has been spent on
                        security sector reform, despite its paramount strategic importance - official development aid
                        disbursed for conflict, peace and security totaled just $530 million between 2006 and 2010,
                        roughly 6% of total aid excluding debt relief. Spending directly on security system management
                        and reform is even lower, $84.79 million over the same period, just over 1%13. A lack of political
                        cohesion after 2006 undermined effective joint pressure on the Congolese government". Poor
                        coordination resulted in piecemeal interventions driven by competing short-term imperatives.
                        The resulting failures have led many to give up on systemic reform altogether.

            6.   This is unsustainable and unacceptable. The DRC's external partners, old and new, must take a
                 stand on SSR. As the dust settles after the 2011 presidential elections, many of the DRC's partners
                 are reassessing their programs'. The international community must take this opportunity to be
                 more forceful in pressing the DRC government to engage in reform. If international donors acted
                 in concert, and effectively capitalized on their political and economic investment in the DRC, they
                 could positively influence DRC government behavior. Their full weight needs to be brought to bear.

            7.   The international community therefore needs to create a new pact with the Congolese
                 government, one that puts in place clear conditions and benchmarks for progress on achieving
                 army reform and minimizing harm to the population in return for continued assistance and
                 recognition. These benchmarks must be based on positive efforts to achieve change. A strategic
                 plan for military reform must be implemented, and a high-level body to coordinate on-going
                 programs set up. And steps must be taken to improve the protection of Congolese civilians,
                 through minimizing human rights abuses carried out by the security forces, and prosecuting
                 the worst offenders.

            8.   This new pact must transcend traditional donors. China will need peace in the DRC for
                 future generations to reap the rewards from its investment. South Africa also has huge and
                 growing economic interests in the DRC. Angola has pressing issues of national security at
                 stake. All need the stability that can only come from effective SSR. The international financial
                 institutions (IFI) have rewarded the stabilization of Congo's macro-economic situation with
                 significant support". They must recognize that continued growth will be dependent on new
                 investment, which in turn demands security. Regional organizations, most importantly the
                 African Union (AU) and Southern African Development Community (SADC), need to play
                 an active role in marshaling effective pressure, and providing a framework for discussion.
                 Critically, this pact must also include the Congolese population. Congolese civil society must
                 have a key voice in defining a global vision for Congo's security, and connecting high-level
                 reform processes with those that matter most, Congo's people.

            9. And the new pact must happen now. Flawed presidential elections have been completed. The
               DRC's relations with its neighbors have improved significantly in recent years. Though security
               in the DRC is precarious, and there are worrying signs of a resurgence of violence in the East,
               challenges to the Congolese government from non-state armed actors have receded. In fact, the
               biggest threats perhaps now come from within the army itself. The government needs effective
               SSR, particularly of the military, to rebuild its reputation at home and abroad, an imperative
               reflected by President Kabila in his speech to the UN General Assembly in November 2011'.
               Since the elections there have been some promising signs of greater receptivity on the part
               of the Congolese government'. The opportunity to engage in an honest dialogue with the
               Government must not be missed.
            10. Though the picture painted above is bleak, it is leavened with hope. There are signs that, with
                the right will and appropriate support, change is possible. Increased numbers of prosecutions
                for sexual violence (including of a senior officer') and the reintegration of child soldiers show
                that justice can be done. FARDC formations trained by the US, South Africa and Belgium
                have performed well in intervening in delicate domestic environments. A census of military
                personnel is nearly complete. If these glimmers of hope are to be sustained and magnified,
                robust action is necessary. With the right political will in Kinshasa, endemic corruption can be
                tackled, salaries paid, and the worst abusers removed. Once the right conditions are in place,
                the long term and large scale work so clearly necessary - reducing the size of both police and
                military through retirement or new demobilization programs, vetting, reinforcing capacity and
                increasing the combat effectiveness of troops - can begin in earnest.

                       RECOMMENDATIONS
                       To the Congolese Government
                       Recognize the urgent need for serious reform to create an effective, professional security
                       sector, especially the military. Overcome previous suspicions and engage positively with the
                       international community in building a new coalition to assist with SSR efforts. Ensure that the
                       voices of the Congolese people are heard in elaborating a new vision for security in the DRC.
                       1. Renew political commitment to security sector reform at the highest levels. Make military
                          reform a top political priority of the new government. Remove from office those individuals
                          that are obstructing SSR and take all necessary steps to achieve effective reform.
                       2. Urgently develop and implement a global vision for security and defense in the DRC in
                          collaboration with Parliament and Congolese civil society, and implement a strategic action
                           plan for achieving the vision of the FARDC set out in legislation. Request international
                           expertise or assistance as appropriate.
                       3. Positively engage with international partners, notably in a high-level international forum
                           on security sector reform, induding though allocating a senior co-Chair, and agree on
                           transparent, measurable benchmarks for progress.
                       4. Collaborate with international partners in re-launching a working-level cooperation body for
                          military reform, based in Kinshasa, including through nominating a high-level co-Chair.
                          Agree on an international partner to provide appropriate technical and administrative
                          support.
                       5. Take urgent action to address the most pressing short-term requirements for ameliorating

 International Community:
 Inadequate and Incoherent
 12.The second aspect key to understanding SSR efforts since
 2006 is the attitudes and actions of the international community.
 The international community has been frequently criticized for
 political incoherence, leading to inadequate, incompatible and
 ineffective interventions, based on short-term national priorities
 and imperatives rather than achieving meaningful, sustainable
 reform". There is a long list of donors and agencies that have
 engaged in reform or training of elements of the security
 services'. These efforts have not resulted in meaningful,
 sustained improvements, let alone the transformation in
 attitudes and effectiveness required.

 Congolese personnel guilty of human rights abuses - shows that

 gender-based violence (SGBV) in the Kivu provinces, notably
 the prosecution of a Lieutenant Colonel for rape in 201180, show
 that justice is possible with the right combination of training,
 material support and political attention. That this landmark
 judgment was delivered by a 'mobile gender court' - a long-
 standing Congolese solution to delivering justice in remote
 areas - demonstrates the importance of working flexibly within

 72 The IMF provides finance to the DEC under an Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
    launched in 2009, worth about $550 million over three years. It expires in June 2012.
    The previous IMF program had been completed in 2006. The IMF, World Bank,
    African Development Bank and European Union also provided budget support in
    2009 and 2010 to help the DEC reach the HIPC completion point, and for emergency
    payment of teachers salaries.
 73 Estimates vary as to the number of armed men in the DEC at the beginning of the
    transition - according to figures provided by the belligerents themselves there were
    more than 300,000. More than 180,000 had passed through a demobilization process
    by December 2006. Figures from 'Completing the demobilization, disarmament and
    reintegration process of armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the
    link to security sector reform of FARDC', Institute for Security Studies Situation
    Report, Henri Boshof, 23 November 2010.
 74 The large scale, formed military units left over from the war and failed transitional
    integration - notably those loyal to war time rebel groups - that were present
    immediately after the 2006 elections have either largely disintegrated or been
    brought into official structures, however nominally. But a constellation of smaller
    groups remain, and there are no comprehensive estimates of the numbers available.
    Assessment is particularly difficult given the terrain, fluid nature of multiple
    militias, defections, re-recruitment and blurring between criminality and organized
    activity,
 75 Between 2002 and early 2012, the UN repatriated more than 26,000 foreign fighters
    and dependents. The FDLR has seen its numbers drop tenfold from 20,000 in 2001
    to some 3000 at present. The LRA has carried out horrific attacks on civilians in
    the DRC, as well as in the CAR and South Sudan, but is down to some 300 fighters
    scattered in small groups across a wide area. Other significant groups are the
    Uganda ADF-NALU, estimated to have 500 fighters, and the Burundian FNL.

    late 2012.
 78 There were an estimated 60,000 FARDC troops deployed in the Kivu provinces in late
    2009. Latest estimates compiled by EUSEC are that the total number of men in the
    Congolese military is 105,000, meaning that nearly 60% of the FARDC are deployed
    in just two provinces. A census of police numbers is underway, with numbers
    estimated at around 100,000.
