I just met with the UK Mission Security Officer, the Protocol Officer and a security officer from the Foreign Minister's
advance team.

                                                                                                                           B5




Hague is due to get on the plane at 3:oo p.m. tomorrow.                                                                    B5


I wouldn't be surprised if Ambassador DiCarlo gets a call from their DPR soon.

Please advise!

Please disregard previous email if I was unable to recall.

Ambassador,
I just received a call from the UK Mission Head of Security,




Kelly is bringing me a letter from the NYPD that I will forward to all when I receive.
                                           The two Officers on the Foreign Secretary's detail are,
                               , both on A2 visas.

I will then ask for instructions.
