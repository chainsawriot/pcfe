This message from Cheryl just hit my mailbox 20 minutes ago--love it, and love being on this
wonderful list of Alex's near and dear--

I'm going to paste in the first page of an article I'm writing on the subject of having it
all, and guess who? Clara Foltz...

WOMAN fALKAmong Women, On t e Road with a Role Model; Role models andhaving                        I* Having
it All


Since the publication last year of my biography
of a pioneering woman lawyer, I've spoken at
seventy book events -many sponsored by women, and
a few with all women attendants. In settings from
century old club houses to sleek Silicon Valley
law firms, the same question comes from the
women. They want to know how Clara Foltz did
itachieve fame, engage great reforms, and raise
five little children as a single mother. The
eagerness and urgency of their queries touch me,
they clearly need a quick fix and need it now.

Though since the late 70s women have been
flocking to law schools and now comprise almost

fifty percent of the students, they are also
dropping out of the profession at an alarming
rate. Many women seem to be finding that they
cannot combine a high powered career with the
demands of the high powered parenting engaged in
these days by the middle class in America. Unlike
Clara Foltz in the 1870s they are unwilling to
"sacrifice all the joys of their young motherhood" to career and achievement.

Whether its possible to combine motherhood with a
career is a hot topic these days --but it has
always loomed large in the discourse. In Clara
Foltz's time, the domestic duties of women were
used to bar their participation in public life
altogether. Women had their own rarified but
limited sphere of activity. Foltz faced the
charge that she would unsex herself and all women by practicing law.

In the generation of women lawyers following the
suffrage victory; and really right up to the late
60's career girls, as we were called were still
not the norm. A girl who wanted to be a lawyer
was thought a very odd duck indeed. For decades,
though the profession was technically open to
women, very few came. The percentage of hovered
around 3 or 4 percent nationwide.

Then in the sixties, the second wave came on, off
the civil rights movement. Women flocked to law
school; overnight the percentage rose to twenty.
These were a new generation indeed, demanding
femaleteachers and coverage and recognition of
their interests in the curriculum. I rode this
wave into my life work as a professor, the first
woman, at Stanford Law School. Even then amidst
the strife and uproar of an active movement where
women were moving very fast to fill all previous
denied positions, even then there were many
crying out that it couldn't be doneit was
impossible to be a great mom and a great lawyer.

Unlike some women in the late first wave of the
women's movement, I did not reject motherhood, or
suggest that leadership in the movement required
sacrifice. I simply did not deal with it. I let
the whole thing ride. My first husband did not
want children, my second already had a little
daughter who absorbed his parental energies. I
had been like a mother to my much younger brother
and found that enough. Moreover, many of my
friends had young children that I enjoyed, as
much as I liked handing them back when they got
fussy. Indeed, I felt about little children like
I did about pets: though often very dear, they
are usually more trouble than they are worth.

  But I would never have said these words...and
indeed when other women said to me that they just

didn't have the mother gene, or thought the whole
thing overrated as an experience, I shivered a
little. You are showing a weakness, I thought,
people will use it against you, as an unnatural
woman... Childless women are still oddities, and
objects of pity; like me they rush to explain
that they really like children (and are quite good with them).

None of this adds up to being a good role model
for the young women asking the existential
question--- how can I be a good parent and a good
lawyer. I do suggest, however, that one answer
is not to assume you have to be a parent. This is
true for men and women, but rings a little more
for women because they are the ones who give a
year of their total life to producing the child,
and are inescapably biologically tied to it.

Clara Foltz was not a great model either.....
