Subject:                          Thank you



Madam Secretary,
Thank you for your persistence on the issue of the Pakistan apology and the GLOCs. I know that it has finally come to a
close and also know this would not have occurred but for your constant efforts to make it thus. I have always been an
admirer, but working with you has deepened my admiration for your clarity, commitment and skill. Without you, this
chapter would still be incomplete.
Wendy
