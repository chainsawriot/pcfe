Subject:                          Materials



In about 20 minutes I will leave a pouch with two binders:
- the supplemental briefing is to replace the binder that cheryl gave to you this morning for prep.
- the supplemental reference binder includes additional background materials and is the first time you are seeing it.

Later this evening, Maria will send to you a pouch which will include a new draft of hearing testimony for your review
and an action memo from NEA that they would like approval for over the weekend (a cable to Algerian PM Sella!).
