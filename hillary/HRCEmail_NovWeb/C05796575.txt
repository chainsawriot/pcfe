I can talk b/w 1 and 2 today or between 4 and 6; can talk any time tomorrow after 10 am. I have not had a chance
actually to READ the Marie Claire article itself, which I obviously want to do today.
Best,
AM

When would be good times for you to talk this weekend?

I will write at greater length this weekend on substance, which is what matters here. But thanks very much for reacting
so fast and for trying to call; that meant a great deal. And take a long walk in the beautiful autumn woods this weekend!
No need to respond; I fully understand if you do not want to put anything in email.
Best,
Anne-Marie
