John--

This reply shows how far behind I am in responding to emails! Between losing my internet/berry service for two weeks
during Sandy and jet lagging around the world, I'm not sure what I never received but am trying to crawl out from under
the ones that are piled up in my in box.

Anyway, I'd love to catch up w you sometime soon.
Cheers from Adelaide!
