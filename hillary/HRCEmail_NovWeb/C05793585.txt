Dear Bill and Tom,


I'm sorry that I cannot be on the Hill today as we had long planned, but very grateful that you both will be. The
Department and I appreciate your leadership everyday.


So, I'll be nursing my cracked head and cheering you on as you "remain calm and carry on"!


Happy Holidays---H
