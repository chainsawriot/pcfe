Subject: RE: Framing Statement - State Draft




We anticipate the release of what are claimed to be several hundred thousand classified State department cables on
Sunday night that detail private diplomatic discussions with foreign governments. By its very nature, field reporting to
Washington is candid and often incomplete information. It is not an expression of policy, nor does it always shape final
policy decisions. Nevertheless, these cables could compromise private discussions with foreign governments and
opposition leaders, and when the substance of private conversations is printed on the front pages of newspapers across
the world, it can deeply impact not only US foreign policy interests, but those of our allies and friends around the world.
To be clear -- such disclosures put at risk our diplomats, intelligence professionals, and people around the world who
come to the United States for assistance in promoting democracy and open government. These documents also may
include named individuals who in many cases live and work under oppressive regimes and who are trying to create more
open and free societies. President Obama supports responsible, accountable, and open government at home and
around the world, but this reckless and dangerous action runs counter to that goal. By releasing stolen and classified
documents, Wikileaks has put at risk not only the cause of human rights but also the lives and work of these individuals.
We condemn in the strongest terms the unauthorized disclosure of classified documents and sensitive national security
information.
