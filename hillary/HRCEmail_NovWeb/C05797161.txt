Dear Hillary,

You'd think you oughtta be allowed to be sick for a little while without your head getting whacked. I suppose it's not much
comfort that even if you had worn a football helmet, it probably wouldn't have helped, because of what recent research
tells us about how concussions happen. So take it easy and take care. At least you're in a job where, unlike football,
concussions (physical ones, anyway) aren't so common.

This is my way--one of them--of wishing you a speedy recovery. Distraction can help too, so I'm attaching a funny picture
of Gaby on the job with her boss Val. It turned up on a Czech gossip webstte, wondering who the mystery blond is. Maria
says the caption is, "No, I'm not getting you ice cream."

Wishing you feeling better, dear friend.

Penn
