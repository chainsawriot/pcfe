I don't know if your talking points reflect it but the GOJ early on in our planning discussions for the Tokyo conf
recognized the importance of Afghan civil society's participation. Not only will 2 reps spk at the mtg today, but the GOJ
and their partners organized an excellent series of discussions yesterday. As the 2nd highest contributor to
development assistance in Afgh, they're also recognizing they need to do more'on women. The Canadians, Norwegians,
Finns, Danes, Aussies and UN have been particularly strong on emphasizing the role of Afghan women throughout
discussions here yesterday.
