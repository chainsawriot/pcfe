Subject: SECDEF'S War on Acronyms




FYI FOR GETTING ON SECDEF'S GOOD SIDE â€” Gates has declared war on acronyms. In a Nov. 30 letter obtained by
Morning Defense, Executive Secretary Michael Bruhn tells department heads, the chiefs, the department secretaries and
other top officials that the use of acronyms is too extensive. "Many acronyms have multiple meanings and are not
always well known outside a particular organization," Bruhn wrote.

"Although using acronyms in written material is intended to make writing clearer, their misuse or abuse does the exact
opposite." So ... "Effective immediately, all written correspondence prepared for the secretary or deputy secretary of
defense will minimize the use of acronyms or include a comprehensive glossary as the last tab of the package," the Nov.
30 letter said. And watch "read-aheads" and "slide presentations," Bruhn writes, since they are acronym magnets.

This acronym proclamation is a BFD for DOD. Have you ever seen a PPT that didn't refer to COCOMs, the GIG, OSD, the
FYDP, ADCON or the G-4? Will it work?
