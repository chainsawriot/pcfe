Subject:                          Call sheet for Aponte



We just heard that Alexander is a definite "No" so Snowe and, now Graham, are high the priority calls.



Purpose of Call: To encourage Senator Snowe and Senator Graham to support the nomination of Mari Carmen Aponte
to be U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador. On Wednesday afternoon the Senate will conduct a cloture vote on her
nomination, likely to be followed by a vote on confirmation.
