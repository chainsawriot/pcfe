To tell you in person today what an honor and a pleasure it has been to work with you over these last four years as Feed
the Future has evolved. Today's event was a terrific pulling together of threads, like country driven strategies, that we
have been working on since literally the first day of the Administration.
You and the Secretary are both rock stars. Over this term, you have both done an incredible amount to help hundreds of
millions of the world's most vulnerable people, including most especially young children.
As you begin to think about your next adventure, I hope that I get a chance to say goodbye and to assure you that there
are many career folks at State who want to see this effort continue on into the future With highest regards, Bill Craft.
