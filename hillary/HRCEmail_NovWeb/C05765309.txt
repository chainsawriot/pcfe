I wanted to let you know that




Obviously, this is deeply disappointing and a major setback for putting in place the last member of our senior SCA
leadership team. Nonetheless, we will engage again to identify a qualified individual for this Schedule C position. In the
meantime, I will continue to use Michael Owen, the office director who covers these countries, as the acting
DAS. Michael has done an excellent job during a very busy period.

I will keep you informed of our progress in identifying a new candidate. Thanks for your continued support.

Regards, Bob
