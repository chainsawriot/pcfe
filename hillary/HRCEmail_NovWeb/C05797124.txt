ALGIERS (Reuters) - The Algerian army is clearing mines planted by al Qaeda-linked fighters at the desert gas
plant they attacked three days ago, the national oil and gas company Sonatrach said on Saturday.

   News of the mine clearing operation came shortly after Algerian official media said special forces had
lauched a final assult against the militants.
