Hey There Huma!

How are you? I've loved the occasional photo and story about you in recent months. You looked great at all stages of
pregnancy and I hope you continue to thrive!
On a sadder note, please see below and please let HRC know, as I'm aware that she and Mayor Polimeni are friendly

Thanks, Mike
