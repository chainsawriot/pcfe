Brock,

DGHR just called me back and said that in fact, the numbers do indicate an increase; compared to 2008,
the number of chiefs of mission belonging to a minority group has been greater under Secretary Clinton
(see attached). I'm told they do not have records available this evening for 2007 and earlier.

Please let me know if this information impacts any of the briefing material we should provide to the
Secretary for the town hall tomorrow.

Thanks,

Nathan L. Macklin
