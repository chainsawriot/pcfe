  Proposed co-marking with the USAID identity and the U.S. flag:



  1).For the English-language (the one on the left could be for something large like a generator,
  the one on the right is for a smaller item such as a water filter and more compressed:




                                                                                            ,
                                                                                          6156

                               FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE




  2). Depending on the audience and the language of the document, the tagline of the USAID
  identity may appear in other languages. In those cases, the same composition as in item 1 above
  will be used, but with the language as dictated by the audience or the language or the document.

  For example, for Urdu-speaking audiences, an Urdu-language tagline will be used:




                          USAID                                           USAID
