Subject: Iran plans new manoeuvres in Hormuz Strait in Feb

TEHRAN (Reuters) - Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) will hold new naval exercises in the Strait of
Hormuz in February, state-run Press TV quoted a military commander as saying on Friday.

    The Guards' Navy Commander Rear Admiral Ali Fadavi said the drill would be "different compared to
previous exercises held by the IRGC", Press TV reported but gave no further details. The last drill in the vital
oil shipping lane ended on Monday.
