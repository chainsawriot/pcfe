Cheryl -

I met with Ambassador Susman again on Friday and he decided not to offer me the position. I just spoke with
Heather and shared with her some of the details. Below is the message I sent to the Ambassador earlier today.
I'd be interested to know what feedback you get guys might get as well.

I want to sincerely thank you for your support and effort in suggesting me for a role at the Embassy. I am
hugely honored to have been considered, and especially to have had my candidacy endorsed by you. Heather
was tremendous through the process - a great resource, plus incredibly gracious and generous with her time and
assistance. You're lucky to have her on your team!

I definitely hope I see you soon. Who knows how soon, given your crazy schedule (!), but I really look forward
to thanking you in person and catching up on everything.

Take care and thanks, again.

Best,

back in touch with you in 6 or 7 weeks, as we discussed, and very much look forward to meeting Sally when
she comes to town.

I hope that whether in an official capacity or not, you consider me as part of your team. It's been a privilege

any assistance. The Court of St James is lucky to have you.

Looking forward to seeing you again soon.
