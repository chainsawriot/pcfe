Without the benefit of seeing the clips yet, I think last night worked well. Pitch perfect, positive in that you wrapped
yourself in the wonderful event.

I actually think there was more interest in whether the Imam was there - as evidence of how much voltage the Mosque
issue still carries. Geoff Earle of the NY Post was there for that reason alone. It's early but my read of the NY Post seems
that their cover is dedicated to KSM losing 40 lbs.

How do you think my remarks went last night? What's your suggestion for my response to any and all questions about
all issues this am?
