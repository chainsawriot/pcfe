BRC,

Hope you are feeling better and over the dreaded stomach flu. Kathleen wanted me to share the below article
with you, as she references in it your assistance to Louisiana post-Katrina. I think there is another one coming
soon making the Katrina - Sandy comparisons in the NYT. Every time I see David Vitter down here I think of
him turning down your offer to help.

That is our update! Am so happy for you that you have a little rest coming - you deserve it more than anyone I
have ever known. Am so proud of everything you accomplished, especially following up on the Beijing
Conference promises. No need to respond. Feel better. Much love, Aprill
