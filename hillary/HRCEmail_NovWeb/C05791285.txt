Clinton Says She's Sorry

It's not every day that we get good - or at least sort of good - news from Pakistan. Just the other day, the editorial board
was expressing concern that Pakistan's military leaders don't exactly get that fighting extremists alongside the United
States is in their interest.

Today, after seven months of bickering, Pakistan finally agreed to reopen supply routes that American and NATO
commanders need as they work to pull soldiers and millions of tons of military equipment from Afghanistan by the end
of 2014. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced the decision.

Islamabad had closed the routes last November after a NATO air attack that killed 24 Pakistani troops. Pakistani officials
insisted that Washington apologize and the Pentagon resisted. The American military said its investigation showed the
Pakistanis were partly to blame. And, of course, they deeply resent the Pakistani army for supporting militants who have
attacked Americans in Afghanistan.

After repeated failed attempts at a resolution, the diplomats and political leaders finally found the right words.

In her statement on Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton said, "We are sorry for the losses suffered by the Pakistani military." She also
expressed "our deepest regrets" for the incident, and "offered our sincere condolences" to the families of the Pakistani
soldiers. She said that she also "acknowledged the mistakes that resulted in the loss of Pakistani military lives."

According to Mrs. Clinton, Pakistan has dropped its demand to charge exorbitant transit fees that would have cost
Washington millions of extra dollars. It's not clear what was behind that decision. But just this afternoon, the AP said the
United States would free up $1 billion in American support for Pakistani counter-terrorism operations that had been on
hold. The agreement could deter Congress from making further cuts in military aid.

There's still a lot of mistrust and     to overcome, but this isn't nothing.
