Subject: Sensitive for the Secretary -- PRM succession

Hi Huma I'd be grateful if you'd pass this message to the Secretary. On this issue, I owe the Secretary my
unvarnished opinions. But given the sensitivity of the issue and the frankness with which the note is written,
I'm not including the Specials. Many thanks, and best, Eric

Madam Secretary:

Before my travel to South Asia earlier this month, you asked for my views on possible successors for me at
PRM, and I want to helpful and responsive to you on what I regard as a very important issue. I have also shared
ideas with both Cheryl and with Jake, who are copied on this email.

In short, PRM needs a strong leader who has your confidence, who knows humanitarian assistance and how it
fits into broader foreign policy issues, and who knows how government operates. As much as any bureau in the
Department, PRM is serving as a model of what you are trying to accomplish with QDDR: it's a bureau that
integrates its assistance (about $1.8 billion last year) and operations (with 28 refugee coordinator offices in
embassies overseas) with U.S. diplomacy, and leverages that assistance to promote our humanitarian and
stabilization objectives. Moreover, while we must do more to enhance State's operational capacity, many
hundreds of foreign service officers have already had considerable operational experience working as U.S.
refugee (and humanitarian) coordinators throughout the world.

Timing: As you know, I pushed back my departure date to help promote a smooth transition, and I very much
hope that a successor could be in place when I leave in early October. To ensure Senate consideration of a new
nominee in September, I'm told by H that a name would need to go to the White House by or before early July,
so that a nomination could be made by August 5 (before the Senate recess).

As I mentioned to you after the morning meeting, there are several individuals who would serve as strong
Assistant Secretaries.

I would welcome the chance â€” and I'd be eager -- to discuss these individuals with you, Cheryl and/or Jake. I
will be on leave beginning on Tuesday, but will certainly be reachable (both before and after).

Best,
Eric
