Thanks for all your work and leadership pulling this event together. Shouldn't have been so hard.

And let's give a cheer for that irrepressible feminist, Bob Hormats!

Safe and fruitful travels, including whatever you do and say on behalf of Grameen---H

I think we are all set with the women's event at the Cook Islands with brief remarks from PM Gillard, the NZ FM, and a
Pacific women leader. You will open the event and they will follow. Wenchi from our staff is en route to help with the
event and your remarks look good. Also, Greta from our staff will be at APEC to support Hormats who will be
participating in the women and economy intervention at the FM meeting and she will stay on for your events. (She
worked closely with the Russians to help them pull off the St. Petersburg conf). I'm off to Morocco and Bangladesh and
will be following your journey from afar. It's another marathon for you.
Bon voyage!
