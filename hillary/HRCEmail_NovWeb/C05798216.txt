Hrc, Cdm, and Cpm -

 Thank you all so much for today. It was so very wonderful of you to do, and was such a moving experience. We're all
strong personalities, but we were pretty dazed and completely humbled throughout. We just couldn't believe it was all
for us, that those people who we respect so deeply were actually saying those things about US - or that we warranted
the full Capricia treatment, which is always so extraordinary to see executed.

This is the most special group of people I've ever been a part of. I'm lucky to be part of this family.

Philippe
