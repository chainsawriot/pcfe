Extended Afghan mission to include 1,000 staff
Last Updated: Monday, November 8, 2010 1 2:14 PM ET

CBC News


Canada will keep up to 1,000 troops in Kabul as part of a plan to extend the country's non-combat mission in
Afghanistan after 2011, the CBC has learned.

The troops will include 750 trainers and at least 200 support staff, according to senior government sources.

They'll work outside of combat at a training academy or large training facility for Afghan soldiers and police
officers, the CBC's James Cudmore reported.

More to come...
