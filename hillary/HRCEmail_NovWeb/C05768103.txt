NOTE TO THE SECRETARY

FROM: Richard Holbrooke, S/SRAP

DATE: April 4, 2010

SUBJECT: President Karzai repeats anti-foreign rhetoric

Despite the furor over his remarks in recent days, President Karzai continues to repeat accusations of foreign
interference. Even the President's closest advisors are concerned by his behavior. He seems determined to settle a score
with the international community in the contest over the revised electoral law.

In the last few days—even after your April 2nd telephone conversation—President Karzai has embarked on a number of
efforts aimed at reversing the Lower House decision on the revised electoral law, including persuading the Upper House
and the Ministry of Justice to side with his interpretation of the Constitution. While there is nothing wrong with pursuing
this as a political objective, on April 3rd he reiterated anti-foreign sentiments when he met with 70 W.I members and
urged them to change their vote

While Karzai's close advisors have told people that much foreign reporting is exaggerated, they say that he is especially
angry because he believes that "the parliamentarians listened more to the US embassy than to him." Several of his
ministers have said that they will confront President Karzai in Monday's Cabinet meeting and demand that he stop
driving a wedge between the United States and Afghanistan.

President Karzai's anti-foreign comments are not supported by the majority of Afghanistan's political class—this is not
an ethnic or factional issue—and leave many, including key ministers, concerned that the President's behavior will
alienate the west and accelerate the departure of internationals. On Saturday, Lower House members, including Speaker
Qanooni, rejected President Karzai's anti-foreign statements and allegations that their vote had been influenced by
outsiders. Some have even gone so far as to suggest that President Karzai be impeached or forced to resign for
threatening Afghanistan's national interests—although we consider this rhetoric and not a real threat.
