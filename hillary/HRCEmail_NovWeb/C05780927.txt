Cheryl.
The last days, particularly the last 48 hours have been extraordinary. Congratulations to all and to the Secretary's
injunction that we not take our eyes off the ball. Clearly the Secretary and the entire national security team conceived of
and executed an historic operation and its aftermath.
                                                                                                                    Thanks
very much.
Wendy
