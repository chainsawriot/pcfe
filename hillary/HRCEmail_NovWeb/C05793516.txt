I know the past week has been very tough so have communicated through Jake about events in your absence. Hope you
will continue to take whatever time you need for a full recovery. You have built a strong team, your vision is clear and
objectives indelible so we will all carry on with your leadership even in your absence. And, of course, we are all ready to
do whatever is needed. Hope you feel better soon.
Best, Wendy
