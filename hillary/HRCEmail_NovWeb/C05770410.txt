Cheryl:

I understand. At this point, just about everyone who is good is committed somewhere.

That said, I am surprised by some of my colleagues who seem to be turning away from an opportunity to play a central
role in shaping our policy in the Americas. This is why we are in this business.




I say this to clear the air, and only ask that we talk if you think the Secretary's musings on this subject might become
more precise.

Regards,
Tom

Cheryl:

My thinking cap is on, and I have come up with the following names:

Outside of State:

                                                                                                      B5
                                                                                                      B6


Within State:




I will keep thinking and come up with additional names. I hope this helps.

Regards,
Tom
