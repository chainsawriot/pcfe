Jake, HRC knows about the creation of the US-Pakistan Women's Council and that its formal announcement will be in NY
as part of Equal Futures event ( couple sentence mention in her longer remarks). I don't think it should be raised as part
of their press avail here, but it would be awkward for her not to mention it privately in the bilat. It would bring a lot of
new, private resources to women's economic empowerment in Pakistan â€” which, among so much else, is critically
needed and the Pakistanis have, been very embracing.
