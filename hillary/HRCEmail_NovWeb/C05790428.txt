Madame Secretary

Our office has forwarded to your specials some cookstove talking points to include in your briefing materials for your
upcoming trip to Norway, but I wanted to emphasize the importance of this opportunity. Norway is the biggest
opportunity to put the cookstove alliance into overdrive.

In your conversation with FM Store nearly two years ago, he noted that their initial $500k commitment was to be a
"down payment" once the Alliance had a strategy in place. We now have that. The Alliance has been seeking a major
commitment from Norway - on the scale of a five years, $50M commitment. Your mention of the progress the Alliance
has made in your meetings w PM Stoltenberg and FM Store could prove crucial in making these commitments happen.

This is the Alliance's highest priority request of you this year. Norway would be second only to the US in commitments.

Radha Muthiah, the Exec Director of the Alliance and I would be happy to go to Norway and give them the details of our
long term strategy.

Thank you very much for your support on this effort.

Kris
