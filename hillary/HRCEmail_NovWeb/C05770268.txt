Monica - pis show to hrc asap.
Hrc - rich reports that ambassador nominations are going thru in the next 15minutes (his best guess). brownback just
put a hold on                                 Rich has not been able to figure out why thru staff - his guess is its a
religious freedom issue, that brownback doesn't thinkwas strong enough on the issue when he was in                    Are
you up for putting a call into brownback right now to urge him to not place hold?
