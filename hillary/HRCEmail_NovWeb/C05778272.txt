I had a good meeting with John. I filled him in on all we have been doing and we agreed to discuss areas where we might
could collaborate with CAP. He was particularly interested in the new CVE initiative.

At the end of the meeting

offered to give him my perspective or answer any questions he might have which he seemed to appreciate.

Hope the trip to Mexico went well.
