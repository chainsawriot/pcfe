Afghanistan in 2009, a 75% increase over 2008, attributes the Taliban's "resilience" to several factors, including
ineffective governance, a porous border, and funding from the narcotics trade (McClatchy

REPORT: Leverage: Designing a Political Campaign for Afghanistan <http://www.cnas.org/node/4427> (PDF
<http://www.cnas.org/files/documents/publications/CNAS_Leverage_Exum_1.pdf> )

CNAS — Andrew Exum — May 6

This report notes that America's counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan has focused more on waging war at the
operational and tactical levels at the expense of the strategic and political levels. "In the end, by having so vocally and
materially committed to the Karzai regime, the United States and its allies are tied to its successes and failures. The goal,
then, should be to maximize the former and minimize the latter through focused application of U.S. leverage." Andrew
Exum is a fellow at CNAS and served on General McChrystal's Afghanistan strategy review team in 2009.




Shah doles out tough love for USAID in policy speech
<http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/05/05/shah_doles_out_tough_love_for_usaid_in_policy_speech>

The Cable —Josh Rogin — May 5

At a town-hall meeting on the campus of the George Washington University this afternoon, USAID Administrator Rajiv
Shah will lay out a broad plan for reforming the organization, which has seen years of depleted resources and
diminished morale.




MFAN Statement: Shah Speech Touches on Important Elements of Reform
<http://www.modernizingfore ignassista nce.org/blog/2010/05/06/mfa n-statement-sha h-speech-touches-on-im porta nt-

Modernizing Foreign Assistance Network — May 6

MFAN congratulates U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Administrator Rajiv Shah for his visionary
speech yesterday to supporters of the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition. In the speech, Administrator Shah strongly
endorsed elevating development as a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy and empowering it as a distinct discipline that
requires unique resources and authority. Citing the fact that global hunger and extreme poverty have increased in
recent years, Administrator Shah issued a call for reform of his Agency and America's development apparatus overall, in
order to drive more tangible results for recipients, implementers, and taxpayers.

A Breakthrough in the Tortured Foreign Aid Debate? <http://blog.gmfus.org/2010/05/05/in-the-united-states-a-
breakthrough-in-the-tortured-foreign-aid-debateh

German Marshall Fund —James Kunder — May 5

In the language of PSD 7, one senses — despite President Obama's strong statements in support of international
development — continued uncertainty about whether the United States government really wants a center of excellence,
strong and vocal, in international development. Rather, a careful reading of the draft document suggests continued
bureaucratic tussles are the order of the day, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) remains a
pawn in these interagency "turf" wars. James Kunder is a Senior Resident Fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the
United States. Previously, he served in multiple positions at USAID, including Acting Deputy Administrator.

Modernizing Foreign Assistance Network — May 6

Since Josh Rogin reported on the leaked National Security Council draft of the Presidential Study Directive on Global
Development Policy <http://www.modernizingforeignassistance.org/blog/2010/05/04/mfan-statement-leaked-white-
house-development-document-has-strong-reform-elementsh (PSD-7), the development community has been abuzz
weighing in on the specific recommendations and the debate for where authority over U.S. development efforts should
be housed. Two MFAN Principals —Jim Kolbe, Senior Transatlantic Fellow, German Marshall Fund, and Carol Peasley,
President, Center for Population & Development Activities — put out their thoughts on the heated policy debate and
what it will take to keep reform moving forward.

Section 1206 and FM F: A Global View <http://budgetinsight.wordpress.com/2010/05/05/section-1206-and-fmf-a-global-

Comparing Section 1206 and FMF is important, however, because the difference between FMF and Section 1206 is not
always clear. Critics of Section 1206 note that the process has become longer-term and more institutional, making it
more like FMF. Moreover, the equipment that has been provided is similar to that provided under FMF, prompting
additional questions as to the "urgency" in some cases. Others question DOD's ability and/or legitimacy in influencing
foreign policy in this way because broader may be missed from a military perspective. Rebecca Williams is a Research

Drip Irrigation farming in Africa <http://feedproxy.google.comh/blogspot/E0chh/a4_F0Q9ie-4/drip-irrigation-
farming-in-africa.html>

Poverty News Blog — May 6

While another drought <http://povertynewsblog.blogspot.com/search/label/farming> grips a part of Africa,
<http://povertynewsblog.blogspot.com/search/label/Africa> we find this story of a technology that can help food
harvests. Drip irrigation is an Israeli farming method that is being introduced to a few in Africa. Instead of continuously
providing food <http://povertynewsblog.blogspot.com/search/label/food%20security> to the starving year after year,
donors are looking at farming methods such as drip irrigation to instead improve agriculture.
<http://povertynewsblog.blogspot.com/search/label/farming> But getting the African farmers to think more like
businessmen who want to improve yields not only for themselves but for their own self-interest will take years of
changing mindsets.
