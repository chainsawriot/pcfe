Madam Secretary,
Glad to hear that you are continuing to make progress. Your email message last evening to all at State was terrific and
know it will be helpful to everyone.
Bill and Tom are hopefully getting some days of needed rest and others as well. I am on duty through Wednesday so
please do not hesitate to let me know if you need anything or wish to catch up on anything. I know Jake has been
briefing you as events have happened but glad he has taken off for a brief respite as well. I will make sure to stay in
touch with Cheryl as well.
I hope you get to Chappaqua on Sunday and have a truly wonderful Christmas with your family and the beginning of a
great new year. Everyone looks forward to making your final weeks at State as meaningful as have been the last four
years. My only regret is that I've only been working for you for these past 15 months. My best to you, the President and
to Chelsea.
Wendy
