Subject: Second new NYC policy

Marjorie

Earlier today, following up on our discussion as promised, I sent you a letter outlining our concerns about the proposed
new NYC policy limiting foreign security personnel to five weapons, and confirming that this proposal was never
approved by either Diplomatic Security or the Secret Service. And reiterating the dangerous conditions this will create
overseas from reciprocal action.

Subsequently I have learned that there is a second new proposed policy that you never mentioned in our discussion, nor
has anyone on your staff.

It is even more restrictive, giving to NYPD the right to deny any weapons at all solely based on its threat analysis

You can imagine the incredible danger this creates for senior USG official traveling abroad, having to depend solely on
the "analysis" of foreign agencies

And it was imposed with no notice and no discussion

What is going on here?

We have always discussed our mutual prospective actions and while we have not always agreed - we have given each
other notice and time to react

This second proposed policy is being implemented tomorrow with notice and discussion

I ask that its implementation be stayed so that we can discuss it

The senior foreign visits scheduled for tomorrow must proceed under the procedures in place before this second new
proposal was announced
