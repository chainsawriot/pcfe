Right now, the R's are making our decisions very easy.

They are rejecting reference to a transitional unity government. They are rejecting its exercise of full executive powers.
They are rejecting any reference to exclusion.

That's on top of all the other issues.

As Annan's people put it, we're not in the same ballpark.

They've gone back to the R's with some of our suggestions.

We'll know soon if the R's are bluffing or hard over.
