        Capricia,
        My mother took this during a recent safari trip to Tanzania â€” thought it was GREAT!

        The Hillag Clinton Shop in Maratu, outside the Lake Manyara region of Tanzania, in the Nagorongoro
        Conservation Area. The shop was also selling Obama kanga (printed wrap celebrating his '08
        victory).

        Feel free to pass along!
        Kristin
