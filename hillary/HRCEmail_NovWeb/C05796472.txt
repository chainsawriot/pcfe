Hi Cheryl, a few weeks ago, Uzra Zeya conveyed Bill's suggestion that the Secretary confer a Distinguished
Service Award on Jeff Feltman that would be presented to him on the occasion of his departure from the
government at the end of this month, and you had agreed. Jeff is unaware that he will be getting the award.




Thanks,

Steve
