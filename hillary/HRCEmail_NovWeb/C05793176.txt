Subject:                           notes from 12/2 morning meeting



MS, per your request, notes on speeches and travel from our meeting this morning.

Overall Consensus on Speeches

Three speeches in January. Dropping Internet Freedom as a separate speech.

Development Speech (Friday, January 4th at USGLC)

Women's Speech (either on the road or Monday, January 14th in Washington)

Final CFR Speech (Thursday, January 17th in Washington)

Overall Discussion on Travel

Continuing to hold the week of January 7th but perhaps breaking this into two trips.

Europe — Poland as an option, less enthusiasm for the UK.

Asia — Korea and Japan. Considering a stop to see Dai, similar to the dinner stop we did with him previously on Chinese
soil but not in Beijing.

Middle East — not identifying a stop/country per se but continuing to examine whether a ME stop makes sense.

Additional options discussed — Mexico as a day trip to see the new leadership.
