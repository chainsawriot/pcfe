   Re: Pat Lang's view

  Pat's view in summary is this: The Palestinians will not and cannot negotiate toward a resolution
  that is not stated as the objective beforehand, that this was a fatal flaw at the 1999 Camp David
  meetings. He believes this is not only a political imperative for them but also a psychological
  one. Obama's initial no-settlements declaration was a non-starter, thrown into a vacuum.
  Launching direct talks without clear conditions, Pat thinks, is doomed to failure. Given that the
  talks are engaged, he thinks that the U.S. should privately state its detailed position on final
  boundaries and Jerusalem at the beginning, making clear that these are the conditions. The U.S.
  must be insistent, especially with Israel, playing very firm and tough, or else the talks will
  collapse, which is likely the Israeli objective. Abbas has agreed to the talks out of basic
  weakness. If the talks fail, he will be drastically discredited and the political prestige of Hamas
  and Hezbollah greatly increased. That will serve Israel's purposes, which are to see the talks fail
  and use their failure as a launching pad for the next stage against Hamas and Hezbollah.
