Background on Peter and Patricia Gruber

Born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1929, Peter Gruber escaped to India with his parents in 1939, three months before the
Second World War engulfed Europe. He was educated in the Himalayas by Irish Christian Brothers and Jesuits, sparking
a lifelong dedication to scholarship and human rights. He later came to the United States, where he launched a successful
investment career and is recognized as a pioneer in the area of emerging markets.

Patricia Gruber has a background in liberal arts, holding a master's degree in psychology from Antioch West University
and a post-master's certificate in psychology from the Psychotherapy Institute in Berkeley. Previously a psychotherapist in
private practice in California, she has in recent years devoted herself full time to the Foundation. In 2010, she was
awarded a Ph.D. honoris causa from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovat, Israel, for her work with the
Foundation.

 In addition to her dedication to the Gruber Foundation since its inception, Pat has been involved with a number of human
rights organizations, including the Advisory Council of the American Bar Association's Center for Human Rights, the
International League for Human Rights at the United Nations.
