Colleagues,

For your situational awareness, per a telephone conference call between AF and Embassy Pretoria, Embassy Pretoria
reports the incident was a criminal act and there were no political/terrorist elements associated with the incident.




                                                                                 Post has let direct staff know, and
Post will send a text message about the incident to Embassy employees.

Embassy Pretoria reports the incident has hit local newswires. The suspect will appear in court on January 14. Post has
requested in writing that the S. African police do not conduct an autopsy yet. Ops also understands DS intends to send a
special investigative team to Johannesburg to assist with the investigation.

Please let us know if you need any further information,

Best regards,

Greg Aunt
Senior Watch Officer
