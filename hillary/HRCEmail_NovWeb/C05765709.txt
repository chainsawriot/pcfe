Cheryl and Rich,
                                                                                                           B6
This is a tough one. We have been trying to find something appropriate for      for months.




                                                                                              [It would be great
if Melanne had an advisory committee for people like this.

Separately I will forward   s most recent email restating her qualifications.

Margaret
