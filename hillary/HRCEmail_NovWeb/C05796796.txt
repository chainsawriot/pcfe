Subject:

Mdme Secretary, Hillary, I just wanted to be in brief contact to tell you how proud I've been of your time as our
Secretary. Our Country could not have been better served, and I know that you've given your all to it.

I remain living in China and trying to continue programs of US China friendship, in which I passionately believe. If you
have a few minutes in the weeks ahead, I'd love to see you.

And as I think you know, I'm here for you in any way I can be, now and in the future.

Bill Owens
