Subject: UN Security Council condemns Syria over massacre (Reuters)



UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The UN Security Council May 27 unanimously condemned the Syrian
government for heavy-weapons attacks on the town of Houla, the site of a massacre of at least 108 people,
including many children, the council president said.

   "The Security Council condemned in the strongest possible terms the killings, confirmed by United Nations
observers, of dozens of men, women and children and the wounding of hundreds more in the village of (Houla),
near Homs, in attacks that involved a series of government artillery and tank shellings on a residential
neighborhood," the non-binding statement said.

  "The Security Council also condemned the killing of civilians by shooting at close range and by severe
physical abuse," said the statement, which was read out after the council's three-hour emergency meeting by
Azerbaijan's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Tofig Musayev.
