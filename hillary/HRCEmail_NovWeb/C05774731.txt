Dear Jan--

    I am so grateful for       and to you for recommending her.
                                 We are holding a farewell party for her today, and if you're in town, can you come by? I
don't know the time, so I'm copying Lauren and asking her to tell us both! I hope you and Lissa are both very well and
looking forward to Spring! H

Dear Hillary,

Just want to be sure you realize that             last day is this Friday. She was to conclude last week, but Cheryl had to
cancel their wrap-up session, so she extended for a week.                                                               has
enormous respect for your leadership and regards it a privilege to have worked on assembling the team. I am sorry to
see her go, because turnover continues throughout an Administration and her wisdom, discretion and substantive
understanding of "the 3 D's" is hard to equal. I hope you'll have a chance to thank her for her service.'

All the best!,

Jan
