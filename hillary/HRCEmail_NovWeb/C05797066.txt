 Jan--

 I am so relieved to be back at work for my last few weeks. Not what I expected, but better than the alternative!


 But I'm sorry that my mishap prevented me from seeing you and Lissa. Is she still in town?
 If so, would she like to visit the State Department? I'd love to arrange that for her or some other time to catch up w
 you. Right now, I'm under doctor's orders to take my schedule slow and keep getting a lot of rest--always hard for me
 to do. But, I do hope to see you during the next few weeks.


' And, here's to a happy and HEALTHY 2013!


 Love, H

Hi


I have been deluged with expressions of concern for you. People think I am closer than I am, apparently. So
much love surrounds you! I have to figure out a good mailing address so I can send a card.




I do so, so hope you are feeling better now that diagnosis is clear. I want to come give you a hug whenever you
can see folk, but imagine you feel very behind being out, so Lissa and I will be patient. She's happy to hop
home anytime you've got time in NY or DC. We love you and we are sending best wishes to Bill & Chelsea
too, because we know well what it's like to worry over illness of someone you love!

Big hugs, my friend,
Jan
