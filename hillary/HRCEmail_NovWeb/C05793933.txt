Subject: Call with TFF

I just spoke to palace Advisor Taib Fasi Fitri (TFF) (who had asked for a call with S) to explain that the Secretary is
travelling in Asia and that I would be glad to convey his message to her. TFF said that he simply wanted to convey from
the King his personal gratitude that the Secretary personally participating in the Strategic Dialogue on 9/13, as that is
such an important set of meetings for Morocco. The King, he said, considers the Secretary a member of his family, and
wanted her to know how grateful he is that she is spending this time with the Moroccan delegation.

I assured him that the Secretary is looking forward to the Strategic Dialogue, that she will join the FM in opening the
plenary, that she and he will sign an MOU (TFF especially asked about the MOU signing), assuming it is agreed by all here
who need to review it, etc. TFF seemed quite pleased that he had had this chance to convey the King's message to the
Secretary and thanked us for our support for and involvement in the Strategic Dialogue. He said he was glad he had
been able to convey the King's message this way and thanked me for my help in doing so.
