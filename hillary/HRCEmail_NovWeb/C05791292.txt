Subject: Fights break out at Syrian opposition meeting in Cairo (Reuters)

CAIRO (Reuters)      - A meeting of Syria's splintered opposition in Cairo on Tuesday descended into scuffles and
fistfights that will dishearten Western leaders calling for unity against Bashar al-Assad.

   A Syrian Kurdish group quit the meeting, sparking mayhem and cries of "scandal, scandal" from some
delegates. Women wept as men traded blows, and staff of the hotel used for the meeting hurriedly removed
tables and chairs as the scuffles spread.

   "The Kurds withdrew because the conference rejected an item that says the Kurdish people must be
recognised," said Abdel Aziz Othman of the National Kurdish Council. "This is unfair and we will no longer
accept to be marginalised."

  "This is so sad. It will have a bad implications for all parties. It will make the Syrian opposition look bad and
demoralise the protesters on the ground," said an opposition activist, 27-year-old Gawad al-Khafib.

   A diplomat from the meeting's host, the Arab League, said the often "chaotic" opposition had made progress
by agreeing on documents outlining principles to shape a new constitution and guide any transition.
