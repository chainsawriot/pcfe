The deadline for the quote is Dec 1. It will not be printed until March 12 so for her purposes, this will be post
government service.

Anything I can to make this easy for her is great (happy to get quotes written you all can cobble together if that helps)

You are wonderful for getting this to her so quickly

Thanks!

Dear Sheryl

Yay! So glad you are done. Congratulations!

Have printed and placed on her chair for when she gets back from Latin America so she will be able to take it home.

Will flag that it's bit crazy at the minute b/c of what you read about, but I am sure she will read and then decide whether
she wants to provide a quote.

What is your deadline — I asked 'o/c while she has been Secretary, we have declined her doing endorsements of non-
government ventures so what to know if this is pre or post her service.

Cheryl,

Hope you are well. Things good?

                                                                                                                                    B6


I finally finished my book manuscript. It is attached, along with a very brief summary of the book. I spoke to Chelsea
about the possibility of having Secretary Clinton and Chelsea do a blurb together for me and Chelsea passed back that
Secretary Clinton would be willing to read the book to see if she would want to (which I am so grateful for). Should I
send it to you at the office to give to her or is there a better way? I am also attaching the soft copy of the summary and
manuscript to this email in case that is easier.

My dream quote would be for Secretary Clinton and Chelsea to say together that this book is for women of all ages, or of
course whatever they would want to say. As background, I never mention Anne-Marie Slaughter in the book and I have
never said anything publicly on her at all                                   ) so Secretary Clinton should not worry that by        B6
endorsing this she is directly criticizing her in any way. I do make the point in Chapter 9 that I think trying to "do it all" is
bad language that sets women up for disappointment, but I had written that long before her article and there are many
women who have used that language.

And not to impose — I realize that you have better things to do — but if you would at all be interested, feel free to read
too. I can send you a printout as well if you want one. (Again, no pressure — I can only imagine how busy you are.) I
need blurbs by Dec 1 so I hope she likes it and there is enough time.

My very best—
Sheryl
