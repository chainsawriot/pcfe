Subject: Gallup Event Today

Dear Cheryl,

We met at Oslo City Hall on June 1 and spoke briefly about whether Secretary Clinton might have future interest in
engaging with the GBC (now GBCHealth), the coalition founded by Richard Holbrooke.

My reason for reaching out today is different. I attended the event at Gallup this morning (Evidence and Impact: Closing
the Gender Data Gap) where you and Secretary Clinton spoke. Your speeches were fantastic. And I can't tell you how
thrilled and appreciative I was when Secretary Clinton made reference to Together for Girls, the partnership to end sexual
violence against children (with particular focus on girls). I am the founder of Together for Girls. We launched at the
Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting in September 2009. We have pursued a data driven approach since the outset of
this initiative, and it was gratifying today to hear all the comments underscoring the criticality of data in mobilizing effective
responses. It is a privilege for us to partner with the US Department of State on this vital collaboration. Secretary
Clinton's kind comments this morning were a wonderful and powerful reinforcement of the importance of this effort to
address sexual violence against girls, and I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate it.

Best regards,

Gary
