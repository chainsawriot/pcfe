Subject: RE: Russia defends weapons sales to Syria, says US arming rebels (Reuters)

Looks like (at least according to the Russians) the Iranians made up that quote:


Lavrov accused the U.S. of helping to provide weapons to the Syrian rebels, according to a translation of
his comments into Farsi to reporters in Tehran. The Russian Foreign Ministry in Moscow later said that
the Farsi translation of Lavrov's comments were inaccurate and that the foreign minister did not accuse
the U.S. of arming the Syrian opposition.
The U.S. "regularly delivers such special equipment to the region, including a recent delivery to one of the
countries of the Persian Gulf, which Americans for some reason think is nothing out of the ordinary," he
said, according to the Russian news agency TASS.
