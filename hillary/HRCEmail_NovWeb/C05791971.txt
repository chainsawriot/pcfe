Subject: HAK Papers

Cheryl and Peggy,

We have not forgotten you! Thanks again for your back channel discussion of a possible solution. We (Kissinger and
Yale) have been discussing how to approach this.

A preliminary concern is, if we raise private funds can we assure the accelerated declassification of all of the HAK
documents in the Library of Congress, not just those that have been referred to State by the Archives?

I spoke to HAK yesterday and have some instructions. He also asked me, once again, to say how very much he
appreciates the effort Hillary and you gave made. Please pass that on to the Secretary. He very much wants to get this
settled during her time as Secretary.

We need to do a bit more homework and hope to get back to you very soon after Labor Day.

I hope you both were able to get some time off this summer.

Best regards,

Jeff
