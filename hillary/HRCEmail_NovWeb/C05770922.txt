Subject: Still Here!

Cheryl â€” Winding down here in Baghdad... As we discussed on the phone the other day, please let me know if I need to
make any decisions about                                                                                       I don't
think it would be necessary, but I just wanted to check.

Also, while I will send a note directly to the Secretary, please let her know how touched I was by her kind comments at
the end of the SVTS conference with the president et al. Much appreciated.

Cheers, Chris
