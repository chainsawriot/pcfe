Subject:                           Hillary--



One thing from the four way secure telecon yesterday that I forgot to mention:
Dave is very insistent that Karzai sign Reintegration Decree before his confirmation hearings so he can focus on it. It has
been sitting on K's desk for several weeks. I pressed hard in my meetings with him to sign it asap.


I asked if a call from you would help (obviously it would). Karl said he would like to hold that option in reserve. He
believes he can it signed late Monday or early enough Tuesday for DP to use at 930am Tuesday hearing.


Since our conversation Saturday, Dave has returned to issue in twob emails to Karl and repeated the importance he
attaches to it, and again I asked about a call by you. Karl remains confident he can deliver on his own. I will keep you
informed. If you wish to make call anyway, let me know. We will get some TPs together for a call tomorrow morning just
in case. RH
