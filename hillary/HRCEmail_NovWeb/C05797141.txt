Subject: Algeria: 32 militants killed, with 23 hostages (AP)

ALGIERS (AP) - The Algerian government says 32 militants and 23 captives were killed during the three-day
military operation to end the hostage crisis at a natural gas plant in the Sahara.
  The provisional death toll was issued by the Interior Ministry on Saturday after the special forces operation
crushed the last holdout of the militants at the gas refinery, resulting in 11 extremists killed along with seven
hostages.
  A total of 685 Algerian and 107 foreigner workers were freed over the course of the standoff, which began on
Wednesday, the statement added.
  The military also confiscated machine guns, rocket launchers, missiles and grenades attached to suicide belts.
   The ministry added that the militants involved consisted of 32 men of various nationalities, including three
Algerians.
