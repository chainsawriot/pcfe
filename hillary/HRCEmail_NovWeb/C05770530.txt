Cheryl,
Thinking through ideas for you all. Usual and solid suspects-                                 even perhaps
               But a brainstorm--                 I know there is some history but life has moved on. He is great
manager, knows budgets and economics, team player, knows WH, development and must be ready for new challenge.
And       has given him some diplomatic experience. Will send more ideas as I have them, but think             good one.
Wendy
