Just got this, and it is GREAT. I had a major meeting internally last week to gear up a bunch of to-dos including
contracting for a focused press effort, confirmation that John Warner will head up a national security and military
leaders group to press for support and the votes, and will soon catch up with Tom who called me a week ago to report
the idea of he and me seeing Kerry soon. Had lunch with Mike McCurry yesterday, and he said he wrote his Wilson
School paper on Law of the Sea and recalled "there were compelling arguments" for it, and I shared how taken I was
with our business roundtable industry comments on a couple of aspects of those arguments that are now more urgent
than ever.

Happy New Year and missya again!
