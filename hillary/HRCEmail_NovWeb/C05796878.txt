Madame Secretary
In the middle of all of the craziness, here is something to touch your heart, just in case
you ever needed to know how much you mean to the people who work for you. The attached comes
from my Assistant Legal Adviser and former Special Assistant Maegan Conklin, a brilliant
young lawyer who was my Special Assistant. We have worked together on hundreds of matters,
but she never told me this story until now. I am sure you remember the occasion. It is
obviously indelibly etched in her family's memory

I am asking her to get me a copy of the photograph for you to autograph, and the names and
address of her parents so you can give it to Maegan to give them. If you were willing, I
could even get her to come up for.a photograph with you receiving the autographed picture. Is
that something you would be willing to do?

Again, you have more pressing matters today, but I wanted you to see this.

With great respect
Harold

Subject: an odd request
To: Harold Koh

Harold,




This may seem a rather odd request, but I wonder if you happen to find the right opportunity,
in these remaining weeks, you might show this picture to the Secretary and tell her that my
family is so grateful for the role she played, with her words and her presence, in making

        UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05796878 Date: 11/30/2015

that graduation day so very memorable. Little did I know that, years later, I would be so
lucky to serve under her leadership here at State.

I do not mean to put you in an awkward position and am cognizant of the fact that this may
well be a wildly inappropriate request. Please do not hesitate to tell me if there is
perhaps a better way for me to pass this message to the Secretary. Ultimately, I am happy
even just for you to know this story.

Thank you too for your faith in me and for the chance to serve in a leadership position in
L. I hope that I will not let you down.

Maegan
