Dear Capricia,

Not sure if you were able to catch my interview with President Clinton last night on Piers Morgan Tonight. Do you think
calling Secretary Clinton the greatest Secretary of State of all time shows just a touch of my bias? Pres. Clinton is
incredible. I hope our current president, who is as busy as can be, gets to see it. I did my best to flatten Romney in a
cool kind of way, and talked about how Donald Trump was uncool was the least I could do. Below is a link in case you
missed it.
