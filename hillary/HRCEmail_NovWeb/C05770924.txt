As I head back, I wanted to tell you that I had a very productive and intensive 4 days in Kabul and Mazar-e-Sharif. The
challenges for women remain enormous but they possess so much talent and are demonstrating leadership in
impressive ways. If more of them were in govt, it would be far less corrupt and more competent! Even Karzai had to
admit they were superb in the peace Jirga.
They are very grateful to you for going out of your way to underscore their role in society and told me how buoyed they
were by your Kabul Conf. statement.




I will do a longer readout as there was much that transpired.




The embassy was very supportive in every way,and I think we have a superb team there now augmented by Todd, Keith
and Guest.


I'll send you a fuller report.
