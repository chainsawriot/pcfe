FYI from NEA:


Per DAS Ford's request, here's a quick summary of what happened in Tripoli over the last few days; there were no
significant security incidents in other parts of the country.




     (U)

The security forces had largely contained the situation by Sunday, June 3; there have been no significant new security
incidents reported on June 4.

      (U)

The three days of fighting

around Tripoli that left at least 15 people dead and 50 injured in clashes that started on June 1 between the Alawite
neighborhood of Jabal Mohsen and the Sunni neighborhood of Bab al Tabbaneh.




      (U) PM Mikati held a meeting on June 2 to discuss the security situation in Tripoli, which provided the political
cover for the Lebanese Armed Forces and Internal Security Forces to use all necessary measures to stop the violence and
to deal with an "iron fist" with any group tampering with security.




•      (SBU) Given the presence of weapons and heightened tensions in the area, we expect these clashes will continue
to flare from time to time but do not think that they are significant enough by themselves to spark conflict in other parts
of Lebanon.
