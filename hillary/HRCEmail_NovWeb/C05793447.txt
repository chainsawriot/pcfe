CAIRO (AP) - Top parties in Egypt's incoming parliament are picking an Islamist as speaker for the first time.
   The Muslim Brotherhood, the big winner in the first election since the ousting of President Hosni Mubarak
last February, said it has joined several other parties in backing Saad el-Katatni. He's the secretary-general of
the Brotherhood's own party.

   The main function of the new parliament is to pick a 100-person commission to draw up a new constitution
for Egypt. The selection shows the power of the Islamists to influence that process.
