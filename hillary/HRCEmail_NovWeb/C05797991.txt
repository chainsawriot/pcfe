Hillary,

I am so glad that you have made it back to the office and that your recovery is going in the right direction. Events like
this, remind all of us to savor the most basic and yet critical aspects of life, our mobility and health.




Please do let me know if there is anything I can do as you move forward with further recovery. And whenever you might
be free, it would be wonderful to catch up.

Gary
