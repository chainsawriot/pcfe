Lots of stuff on high side, but what you need for a Sunday is as follows:

Ayyad called me to say Iraqqiya would announce its support for Adel tomorrow. That was at mid-day. However,
subsequent contacts with lots of people indicated that it's become more complicated, over the Presidency and possibly
some ISCI cold-feet. Now plan at bedtime is for a press event indicating the signing of an ISCl/Iraqqiya pact (Fadillah
today indicated it probably would stay out to me), but no info made public on what the pact consists of, i.e, not even
support for Adel.

This sounds weird so we'll see what happens. I will see Ayyad and Adel tomorrow, and GEN Austin and I will travel to see
Barzani before rest of crowd gets up there. Jim
