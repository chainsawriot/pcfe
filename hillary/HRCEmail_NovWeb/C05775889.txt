Cheryl,
As I look at all the holes that are already becoming apparent re our ability to do development as I phase out and if
were not here, I wonder again if we shdnt try to hire         as deputy director for development in S/P before I leave or
w/ the transition (this is assuming         succeeds me). Given how much time I put in to trying to get the rest of the
building to pay attention to development and to pushing that entire part of S's agenda (as do u, of course), which
will not do except as specifically tasked, I am increasingly worried about what is going to happen. I think she wd take the
job if properly formulated, and we will HAVE an open slot by the end of the year (I just found that out.) But ithe trick is
making it a deputy directorship -- like a DAS anywhere else.
