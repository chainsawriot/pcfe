Republicans not handling election results well
PPP's first post election national poll finds that Republicans are taking the results pretty hard.. .and
also declining in numbers.
49% of GOP voters nationally say they think that ACORN stole the election for President Obama. We
found that 52% of Republicans thought that ACORN stole the 2008 election for Obama, so this is a
modest decline, but perhaps smaller than might have been expected given that ACORN doesn't exist
anymore.
Some GOP voters are so unhappy with the outcome that they no longer care to be a part of the United
States. 25% of Republicans say they would like their state to secede from the union compared to 56%
who want to stay and 19% who aren't sure.
One reason that such a high percentage of Republicans are holding what could be seen as extreme
views is that their numbers are declining. Our final poll before the election, which hit the final
outcome almost on the head, found 39% of voters identifying themselves as Democrats and 37% as
Republicans. Since the election we've seen a 5 point increase in Democratic identification to 44%, and
a 5 point decrease in Republican identification to 32%.
Other notes from our national poll:
-Grover Norquist is largely unknown nationally, and among voters who are familiar with him he is
generally disliked. Only 15% have a favorable opinion of him to 37% with a negative one, with 48% not
holding an opinion one way or the other. Even among Republicans just 18% see him positively, while
23% have an unfavorable view. Only 23% of voters think it's important for politicians to follow
Norquist's tax pledge to 39% who think it's not important and 38% who don't have an opinion.
-President Obama's received a modest post election bump in his approval rating. 5o% of voters now
approve of him to 47% who disapprove, up a net 4 points from 48/49 on our final post election poll.
Voters trust Obama over Congressional Republicans on the issue of Libya by a 48/45 margin,
suggesting that their attacks on the issue aren't getting much traction.
 -As much of an obsession as Bowles/Simpson can be for the DC pundit class, most Americans don't
 have an opinion about it. 23% support it, 16% oppose it, and 60% say they don't have a take one way
 or the other.
 The 39% of Americans with an opinion about Bowles/Simpson is only slightly higher than the 25%
 with one about Panetta/Burns, a mythical Clinton Chief of Staff/former western Republican Senator
 combo we conceived of to test how many people would say they had an opinion even about something
 that doesn't exist.
 Bowles/Simpson does have bipartisan support from the small swath of Americans with an opinion
 about it. Republicans support it 26/18, Democrats favor it 21/14, and independents are for it by a
 24/18 margin. Panetta/Burns doesn't fare as well with 8% support and 17% opposition.

-David Petraeus has a 44/30 favorability rating nationally and is seen much more favorably by
Democrats (47/25) at this point than Republicans (38/36).
