Subject: Jesse Jackson Jr. submits letter of resignation (AP)

WASHINGTON (AP) - A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner says he has received letter of
resignation from Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr.
   Boehner's spokesman Michael Steel said Wednesday the Speaker's office received a letter of resignation from
Jackson. Boehner's office did not immediately comment beyond acknowledging they'd received the letter.
   Jackson was easily re-elected earlier this month to a ninth term despite not having appeared in public since
quietly taking medical leave in June for treatment of bipolar disorder.
   The House Ethics Committee has been looking into whether Jackson was involved in discussions about
raising money for imprisoned ex-Gov. Rod Blagojevich's campaign in exchange for an appointment to President
Barack Obama's vacated Senate seat.
   There also have been reports of a federal investigation into possible misuse of campaign money.
