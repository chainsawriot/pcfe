Subject: Last Day

Dear Colleagues,

On my last day as Deputy SRAP and DAS, I want to thank one and all for your collegiality and friendship over the past 18
months. We've achieved a lot, in my view, and I'm truly grateful to have had the opportunity to work with all of you on
such critical and difficult issues, There will be other opportunities next week to say good-bye — or rather so long for
now, since I hope to work again with as many of you as possible. Today I'd simply like to turn over the reins fully, after a
week-long overlap, to my successor, Frank Ruggiero.

If the Senate confirm's me, I look forward to seeing you in Malaysia.

Best regards, Paul

PS — pis don't hit reply to all on this email.
