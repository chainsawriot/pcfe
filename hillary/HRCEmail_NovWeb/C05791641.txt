BREAKING - "British diplomats to attend Chinese trial of Bo Xilai's wife" - AFP/London: "China has granted
British diplomats extremely rare access to the trial of the wife of disgraced Chinese politician Bo Xilai for the
murder of Briton Neil Heywood, the foreign ministry said Saturday. ... [T]he start of the highly politically-
charged court proceedings in the eastern city of Hefei [will be] August 9. ... The scandal embroiling Bo, who
was one of China's most prominent Communist Party leaders before his downfall this year, is the biggest to
strike the Chinese political world in decades. It is highly unusual for foreign diplomats to be given access to
such a politically sensitive trial in China."
