Following is based on Erekat and other members of Palestinian delegation in Sine:




None of these options was referenced publicly in the Arab League statement itself,




                                                       The Follow-Up Committee blamed Israel for the halting of the
negotiating process, praised POTUS's efforts, and left a door open for the USG to get the peace process back on
track. They will meet within a month                                        to review the alternatives presented by Abbas
and decide next steps.

Since we have not seen the text of the speech itself, we cannot confirm whether he said anything on the question of
resignation. However, the issue has already bled out into the press. A participant at a meeting of the Palestine National
Council in Amman on Wednesday commented publicly that Abbas reportedly hinted at a possible resignation, and Akiva
Eldar's piece in Ha'aretz alleged that he has communicated his intention to resign to the USG.
