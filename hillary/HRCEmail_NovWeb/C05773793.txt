Subject:                           Schedule



MS, please find your schedule for tomorrow below. A few items to mention â€” one, your remarks will be delivered from the
table. This is the protocol of the US/Spain Council, they do not use podiums/table top podiums and both Menendez and
the Crown Prince will be delivering their remarks this way. Secondly, the royal delegation has asked for your meeting to
be before the remarks and suggested 5-10 minutes in length. We have padded it for 10-15 just in case. Finally, Princess
Letizia will be attending the remarks. As she does not involved herself in anything political, she asked to greet you after
your meeting with the Crown Prince and be seated along the table with the other council members to listen to the
remarks. Thank you!
