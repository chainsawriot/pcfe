Got it. Here is the list that I have. Do you want to do any of these?

1. Ban Ki-Moon reached out to you on Wednesday evening while you were on the plane.

2. We reached out to Fabius, Westerwelle, Blair and Hague on Wednesday and you spoke with all except for Hague. Not
sure if you still wanted to speak with him.

3. HBJ called for you on 11/18 (after the call where you couldn't hear him). You tried him in the car on the way to dinner
w the PM of Thailand but did not get through.

4. We've been asked by the desk to hold off on the Jebali call. Since the request has been made, the situation has
evolved and the GOT is cooperating. The desk has said that they will keep your office updated on the situation.
