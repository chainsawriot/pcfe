Subject: Egypt's president to visit U.S. in September (Reuters)

CAIRO (Reuters) -     Egypt's President Mohamed Mursi will visit the United States on Sept. 23, making his first
trip there since taking power in June, the presidential spokesman said on Wednesday.

   The United States was a close ally of Egypt under ousted President Hosni Mubarak and gives $1.3 billion in
military aid a year to Egypt plus other assistance.

  "President Mursi will visit the United States on Sept. 23 after his visit to China," presidential spokesman
Yasser Ali told Reuters, referring to a visit to Beijing next week.

  In July, U.S. President Barack Obama invited Mursi to the United States in September during the U.N.
General Assembly meetings, but no date was announced.

  Mursi is due to visit China on Aug. 27 and will then go to Iran to attend a meeting of the Non-Aligned
Movement on Aug. 30. His first official visit was to Saudi Arabia.
