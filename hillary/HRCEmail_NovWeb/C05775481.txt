The fear of a friend

Thomas Friedman is one of the most important journalists in the world and writes a column for the New York Times. Last
week he published a column that was unique in its criticism of Israel for its policies on the Palestinian issue, among
others, equating it to a "spoiled child." One of the paper's readers wrote in a letter to the editor: "Israel is not only
behaving like a spoiled child, like Friedman said, but like a child who ran away from home, who continues to use to use
the family's credit card." In addition, he was interviewed to Channel 2's "Meet the Press."

As much as the content of the column is disturbing — listening and watching him evoked deep concern. During the
interview he explained why the Israeli government's conduct is slowly eroding Israel's standing within the United States:
a decline in support among government circles, the general public, and the Jewish community, especially the younger
generation. The Americans don't understand what Israel wants, don't know where it is heading and doubt its desire for
peace. On the other hand, Friedman says, the Palestinian Authority, in its current structure, especially because of the
good work in enforcing security and reigning in terror, is worthy more than ever to a genuine Israeli opportunity to reach
an agreement.

Friedman is completely aware of the complexities and difficulties associated with reaching an Israeli-Palestinian
agreement, but begs Israel to at least "make an effort." He is deeply fearful to the strength of Israel — US relationship: he
objects to the insult of the American President manifested through the rejection of an extension to the settlement
construction moratorium for two more months, and warns against a deterioration of the critical relationship between
Israel and its only friend in the world.

Friedman was a bit distraught, emotional, and sometimes even angry and it was clear how much he is hurting because of
the current situation. His words are twice as harsh because they were said by a friend and someone who does not hide
his deep love which will be "unchanged" to the state of Israel.

You are forewarned: Friedman should be taken seriously. Very seriously. Not only because he is an important and
influential man, but mainly for his connections, knowledge, understanding, and vast experience. Friedman has direct
contact with decision makers, a rare knowledge of what is happening in Israel, the region, and the US, academic training
coupled by decades of research, involvement, and deep journalistic observations, from near and from afar, on what is
happening in the region.

Friedman has a warm and tight relationship with Israel from his youth. It would be difficult to write off the severity of his
words as coming from a "self-loathing Jew." His words should evoke much concern. (We) need to listen to him well,
listen and change. As soon as possible."
