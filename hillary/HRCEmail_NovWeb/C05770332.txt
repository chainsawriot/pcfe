Sergey just called to say Lavrov reacted positively to the draft statement. He expected Borodavkin would call the Senator
tomorrow or early Monday, or he, Sergey, would call me with the formal go ahead. I stressed the sooner, the better; but
Sunday is a problem.

On the latter point, ConGen hears Abbas may be traveling 2nd half of week to East Africa (the aborted trip). We are
seeking more details. That would argue for either a Monday evening departure by the Senator for Tuesday evening with
Abbas and Weds morning with BN, or a possible delay till next weekend. David
