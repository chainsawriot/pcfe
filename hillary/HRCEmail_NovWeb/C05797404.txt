Subject: Mandela's recovery 'on track' at home - S.African government (Reuters)


JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Former South African President Nelson Mandela's recovery is 'on track' at his
home in Johannesburg, the government said on Wednesday in its first statement since the anti-apartheid hero
was released from hospital a week ago.

   "Madiba's recovery continues on track," presidency spokesman Mac Maharaj said referring to Mandela by
his clan name.

   "We are now in the phase where if we do not hear from his doctors, we assume he is all right," he said,
without giving details on Mandela's condition.

   Mandela has been receiving what the government calls "home-based high care" at his residence in an upscale
Johannesburg neighbourhood.
