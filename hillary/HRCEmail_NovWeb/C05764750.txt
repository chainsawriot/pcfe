Thanks so much for offering. Maybe the best thing is to just let him know you're sorry it didn't work out, that it
seems like it was not a good fit and that you agree I'm overqualified for what he wants. But, if there is any way
you can reinforce your positive view of me and that he should recommend me if he hears about appropriate
positions, that would be great.

I think he just did not want to shift and liked me despite himself. I gave it my best shot and btwn you and me, if
he undervalues that role he just under serves himself. But I really do appreciate him taking the time to consider
me and want to stay in touch.

That means I'm on the market!! If you hear of anything great or appropriate, let me know!

Love to everyone and thanks, again!

Cheryl -

I met with Ambassador Susman again on Friday and he decided not to offer me the position. I just spoke with
Heather and shared with her some of the details. Below is the message I sent to the Ambassador earlier today.
I'd be interested to know what feedback you get guys might get as well.

I want to sincerely thank you for your support and effort in suggesting me for a role at the Embassy. I am
hugely honored to have been considered, and especially to have had my candidacy endorsed by you. Heather
was tremendous through the process - a great resource, plus incredibly gracious and generous with her time and
assistance. You're lucky to have her on your team!

I definitely hope I see you soon. Who knows how soon, given your crazy schedule (!), but I really look forward
to thanking you in person and catching up on everything.

Take care and thanks, again.

Best
                                                                                                     B6

Dear Ambassador Susman,

Thank you, again, for taking the time to consider a possible role for me at the Embassy.

I appreciate your candor and sincerity in explaining your circumstance and needs, and in advising me on
alternative paths to take.

I have already followed up with               and am looking forward to joining the             I'll also get         B6
back in touch with you in 6 or 7 weeks, as we discussed, and very much look forward to meeting Sally when
she comes to town.

I hope that whether in an official capacity or not, you consider me as part of your team. It's been a privilege
meeting you, especially during this busy time of settling in, and please don't hesitate to call if I can ever be of
any assistance. The Court of St James is lucky to have you.

Looking forward to seeing you again soon.

Best,
