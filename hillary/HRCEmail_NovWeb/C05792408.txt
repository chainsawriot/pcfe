Wendy--

Thanks for the feedback and for all the work you did on these issues and countries.

Just landed in Nigeria where no dancing is expected.

All best, H

Dear Madam Secretary, Johnnie,
Just wanted you both to know how extraordinary the coverage is of your trip to Africa is and how consequential the trip
has been. Although, unbelievably, as of this writing you still have three countries to go before Turkey, at each and every
stop the agenda has moved forward. Whether Sudan and South Sudan making progress, challenging South Africa to
move ahead by remembering what has come before, reinforcing Joyce Banda and more, everyone here is truly taken by
all of your movesâ€”including Madam Secretary, your dance moves (consensus is that Bob needs a couple more
moves!). Most of us only wish we had been with you on the trip. Off on Sunday to Beijing (spoke with VFM yesterday to
thank him on Sudan/South Sudan), Moscow and London next week but will catch up from the road.
Best,
Wendy
