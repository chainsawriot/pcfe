Jake/Jim--

Tried to call you before.
                                  This will get considerable attention. Need to make sure S is ok with this. I can provide
addition details by phone if needed. Plan is to notify key partners ahead of time, hill leadership and key industry (dhs)
before posting tomorrow late afternoon. We are working cables and q and a.
Dan
