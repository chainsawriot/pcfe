         Why does Hillary Clinton appear so capable at Senate hearing? Because she knows her brief and the
         issues better than anyone in the room.

    1. Daniel Drezner Pdandrezner


         Conspiracy-mongers are gonna go nuts after Clinton's testimony today. For someone with serious health
         scares last month, she looks fabulous.

    1.   Philip Klein pphilipaklein


         Shorter Hillary Clinton: "You can't handle the truth!"

    1. Market Bull â‚¬D-Market Bull


         Nobody puts Hillary in a corner.

    1. David Rothkopf @clirothkopf


         Hillary Clinton is doing magnificently in the Benghazi hearing. Strong, clear, focused on solutions. She
         will be missed.

    1.   Andrea Mitchell pmitchellreports


         Toughest exchange in hearing w/ Wisconson GOP Sen Johnson over talking pts Clinton not taking any
         guff from these guys #mitcheltreports

    1. Josh Rogin pjoshrogin


         Subtext of Clinton shouting at Sen. Johnson: There's nothing you can do to me now, so I'm not taking
         any more of your shit.

   "What difference at this point does it make?!" whether there was a protest. Clinton yells at Ron
   Johnson. Damn.

   Pm a little in awe.
