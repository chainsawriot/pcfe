Subject: Fw: Lebanon after the Wissam al-Hassan assassination

Jake, you and maybe S might be interested in this message below. I'm sure you all know who Wissam al-Hassan is and
what he represented; that's not covered in my note to my guy in Lebanon.                                           B1

Again, I don't want to sound as though I think the sky is falling in Lebanon. But I don't think we can be too careful. I would
appreciate your reaction. If you think of other calls I should be making, please let me know.

Warmly,
Jeff
