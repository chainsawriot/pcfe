Priorities Meeting:

I am going to get Lona to put this meeting on the calendar for 30 mins each week. It will be on tues or thurs for 30 mins
starting this week so it's on a day when huma is scheduled to be in the office (me, jake, huma, lona, PIR). Does that still
work for you?

Lunch w/ Acting Comm S

I forgot to share that Lona said she asked to meet w/ you to seek your guidance. It can be a meeting instead of a lunch.
And it can be moved.

                                so I will be in around 845/9am.
