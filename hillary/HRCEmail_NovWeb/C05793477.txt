Subject:                         FW: Renomination of Joan Donoghue as US Judge on the ICJ



Madame Secretary:

I hope you are feeling ok. As usual, you have done amazing things on your travels.

As Jake will mention to you, USUN is planning to launch a campaign for Joan Donoghue's re-election to
the International Court of Justice with a January 16 lunch in New York (paid for with the funds set aside
for the Sixth Committee reception that was cancelled). Do you agree that we should renominate
Joan? Assuming that you do, we would proceed to consult with the National Group and get them to re-
nominate her before I leave on Jan 22.

Frankly, this seems like a no-brainer. Joan is serving out the last three years of Tom Buergenthal's term
and if reelected, which should happen easily (she was overwhelmingly voted in the first time) she would
have a nine year term of her own right. At the end of that (12 years), she would still be under 70 and
could become the first woman (and only the second American) president of the ICJ by running for
President. By all accounts she has been a huge success. She has impressed everyone, made great friends
on the Court, written good opinions, done great outreach (she speaks Arabic and Russian), and is best
friends with the Chinese judge (also a woman). Nominating her would be one of your signal
contributions to international law, which may last for another 18 years.

Please let me know if you have any concerns. I can provide further documentation on each of these points if you wish,
but Joan has done everything well, as you might have expected.


Best,
Harold
