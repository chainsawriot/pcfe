Dear Jake,

Please give Secretary Clinton our appreciation for handling the questioning by the Senate and Congress.
Her patience was admirable for the senseless conduct displayed by some members of Congress. She handled them with
class and professionalism. I could not have been more proud of her that day.
You all do wonderful work. You keep America free and keep our efforts to World Peace and Progress alive.

God Bless,
Dan Rooney
