Jake and Huma

Greetings. It was wonderful to see you both this week, and it was especially reassuring to see the Secretary (for whom
I'd walk on hot coals barefoot). While I don't regret my move, I do miss you all. And I still feel as though I'm on some
weird TDY that will end soon and my old life will resume. I've not yet fully adjusted to the implications of leaving!

Anyway, those are my dispiriting thoughts on a Sunday night.

Cheers,

I just woke up so I missed Dan. Could he come back after I finish my calls? But I don't have the call schedule yet so I don't
know when that would be. Do you?
