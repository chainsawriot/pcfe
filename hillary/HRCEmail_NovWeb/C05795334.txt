Subject: Fw: Halki visit

Greeting from Halki -- photo attached. Very well-received visit this afternoon. Heard positive things from Sinirlioglu this
morning (govt preparing two bills to change necessary laws they hope to introduce in new parliamentary session by
October). Patriarchate making plans to open in near future just in case. No specific linkage by Turkey to Greece, though I
got assurances in Athens they plan to open Mosque in any case. No guarantees here -- and optimism has been deflated
before -- but good chance for progress that I insisted would be most welcome and timely.
Best,
Phil
