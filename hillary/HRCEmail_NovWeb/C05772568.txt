Page two says:

- para on full 67 lines withdrawal incl Golan and S Leb etc

- stuff on Gaza humanitarian sit

-para on import of ending Pal internal divisions

- committee to meet again in a month.

There are others who can improve on my 3+ Arabic but that's the main stuff.

Think basic US press msg should be they called for cont'd US effort, did not close door, we'll keep at it.

Zaki just texted me that the committee gave one more month to review options. And Judeh texted that the 'good' part of
the communique for us to build on and react to is in its 2nd para.

Subject: Judeh's Readout

He'll send me an email and will call the Senator later this evening.

He described the evening as unpleasant, but Abbas did what NJ told the Senator he would do, viz emphasized he was
and wanted to remain engaged with us in efforts to preserve the direct talks based on a moratorium, but outlined the
options as described to us for consideration if talks do not continue. There was an effort to include those options in the
communique, but that was blocked by our friends. Judeh says key pt in stmt is support continued US led discussion with
all parties to create conditions conducive to continued negs.

We should get text before reacting - do any press contacts have it? - and if Judeh is accurate, focus on that line and affirm
we continue our efforts.

I've been in sms comma with Judeh, who says forget the headlines not so bad and will call in 10, and Zaki, who is less
responsive.

Let's not react till we know what we are reacting to.

Otte has similarly recommended Eu hold reaction.

Do we know if there is anything to this report? We established that a lot would be said throughout the weekend, but
reports like this are difficult to side-step. Are we still waiting until meetings end tomorrow?

Thanks,
Ambrose

Subject: (Reuters) Arab League endorses Palestinian decision to stop talks

SIRTE (Reuters) - An Arab League committee said on October 8 it endorsed the decision of the Palestinian leadership to
halt talks with Israel over settlement building.

   The committee of Arab foreign ministers, which handles issues related to the peace process, also expressed hope that
the United States will keep up pressure on Israel to halt settlement building, the group's chairman told reporters.
