    We just added Kenya only for government meetings but I'm copying Huma and Lona to see whether I could at least meet
    the fellows and have a photo w them.

    Dear Hillary,

    Not sure if Kenya is on your itinerary, but the Acumen East African Fellows program is incredible -- would
    love to tell you about it. Definitely worth meeting them if you will be there, because this is a very significant
    investment in building human capital, and networks that cross the economic, tribal, cultural and other divides
    that hobble inclusive development. It was a big gamble to organize this, but the first cohort has completed their
    year with amazing results.

    I'm actually thinking of going on this trip -- taking over your travel shoes as you hang them up for awhile! Just
    wish I could have traveled with you while you've been at State, but look forward to times when your life is not
    so completely officially orchestrated!

    Jan

         Dear Jan,

         I am writing to invite you to join a small group of Acumen Partners for a trip to
         Kenya and Uganda the week of January 13th, 2013. We will spend time with the
         Acumen East Africa team, visit up to five Acumen investees, and also have the
         chance to see the work of the amazing East Africa Fellows. In addition, for those
         interested there is an option to extend this trip with a safari through our partner
         Elevate Destinations.

         All details on the trip can be found here, and we will take RSVPs on a first-come
         first-serve basis.

         East Africa has been the fastest-growing region for Acumen over the past five
         years, with a portfolio that's grown to $18.5 million in 13 companies across our
         sectors. We've seen particular growth in agriculture and renewable energy
         access, which will be the primary focus of this trip, and we are learning so much
         about how these issues directly impact the lives and well-being of our customers.

         For any questions about the trip please reply to this note or contact Megan Beck
         at 1              or mbeck

         We hope you can join us!

         Warm regards,



         Batool Hassan
         Head of Business Development I Acumen Fund

         p.s. In case you missed the date our annual Investor Gathering is on November
         8th, 2012 in New York!
