Dear friends of Myra,




How wonderful friend Myra passed away at 1:25 this morning I                                                               B6




I'll send details about funeral plans etc. when I have them.                                                               B6
                 My thanks to each of you also. Myra gave us so much and one of the best things is that she gave us each
other and new and wonderful friendships.
