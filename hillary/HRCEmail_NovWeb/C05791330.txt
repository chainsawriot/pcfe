Subject: Palestinian hunger striker in critical condition (AP)

JERUSALEM (AP) - An advocate says a Palestinian prisoner is in critical condition after a nearly three-month
hunger strike.
  Akram Rikhawi started fasting on April 12, just before 1,200 other prisoners began refusing food to demand
better conditions.
  Israeli authorities reached a deal with participants in the wider strike by mid-May, easing some restrictions.
Rikhawi has continued to protest his detention by refusing food.
  According to Physicians for Human Rights-Israel, the 39-year-old Rikhawi seeks early release from his nine-
year sentence due to his ailments, which include diabetes and asthma. Advocate Anat Litvin on Thursday said
"he doesn't have much time."
  Rikhawi was convicted of transporting suicide bombers, planting explosives and targeting Israeli troops.
  Israeli Prison Service spokeswoman Sivan Weizman said the prison service would do all it can to keep
Rikhawi alive.
