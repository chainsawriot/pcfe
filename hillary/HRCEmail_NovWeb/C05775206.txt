I raised this idea over the weekend, but know how much you had going on and it obviously cannot be done
overnight. As it happened, I was meeting with                     on something else and mentioned it to him. He

flesh it out if you are interested. AM

Subject: Pledge for Palestine



This may be a crazy idea, but as far as we can tell we need ideas. Suppose we launched a
"Pledge for Palestine" campaign that copies Warren Buffet's "The Giving Pledge" campaign,
described below — he's trying to get 40 billionaires to give away most of their money. I had
asked some S/P folks to think about how we might take that campaign global to help change the
attitudes of elites in places like Pakistan and Latin America, but perhaps Warren Buffet could
be convinced to lend his name — or perhaps Michael Bloomberg or Danny Abraham (together
with a very wealthy Muslim) — to a similar Pledge for Palestine campaign. Such a campaign
among billionaires/multi-millionaires around the world would reflect a strong vote of
confidence in the building of a Palestinian state and could offset the ending of the moratorium
for Palestinians (there would also be a certain shaming effect re Israelis, who would be building
settlements in the face of a pledge for peace). With even 30 calls to the right people in the
Clinton fundraising network it should be possible to generate a substantial enough amount
quickly enough to capture the public imagination on the heels of the President's speech and,
critically, to serve as an expression of global solidarity with the Palestinians and but also a
meaningful promise of material improvements for Palestinians on the West Bank. That could
significantly bolster Abbas in a way that could help him stay in the talks. This is what
diplomacy beyond the state should mean.

A brief description of the Buffett campaign is below; a longer description with the people
Buffett has approached is attached.

Warren Buffet's "The Giving Pledge"

WHAT: Launched by Warren Buffett during the Summer of 2010, the Giving Pledge is an effort to invite the
wealthiest individuals and families in America to commit to giving the majority of their wealth to the philanthropic
causes and charitable organizations of their choice either during their lifetime or after their death. Each person who
chooses to pledge will make this statement publicly, along with a letter explaining their decision to pledge. At an
annual event, those who take the pledge will come together to share ideas and learn from each other.
