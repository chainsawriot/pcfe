Seems to have made a significant difference.

In UNSC today, he was better than expected and gave us a little running room. While he didn't
explicitly call for Ch VII sanctions, he did say that the Council had to "insist on the full implementation
of its prior resolutions and make clear that there will be consequences for non-compliance." That
gave us and our allies some string to play with. We still have a long, hard road ahead and not much
confidence in getting anything great out of the UNSC, but we got a better launch than we
anticipated today.

All credit and gratitude to the Secretary. Jake, please thank her personally for me.

Many thanks,

Susan
