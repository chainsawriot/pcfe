All,

EAP is still waiting on confirmation on whether former Philippines President Aquino's funeral will be a private affair or
whether it will be necessary to send a presidential delegation.

In preparation for a presidential delegation, EAP has recommended the following individuals to serve as delegates.

1) George Schultz, former Secretary of State (to head delegation)
