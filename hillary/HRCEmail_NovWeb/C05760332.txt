Subject: Career Ambassador Board

Cheryl

We did not get a chance to finish up on this subject

I propose that we go ahead and have the board meet this coming wednesday evening

This would be first meeting in a couple of years

Bill burns is available as am I; the other board members are a diverse mix of retired career ambassadors who are also
available this week

I would set a max of five total, of which there are two now

Statutorily we could get to eight or nine but that is too many in bill and my opinion

Board would meet every other year and could propose no more than two names to the secretary, who could accept
none or one or two for transmission to the secretary

Ok?

Regards

Pat
