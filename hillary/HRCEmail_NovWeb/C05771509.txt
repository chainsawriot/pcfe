Congress
Cheryl asked Rich to provide an analysis of the impact of possible post-election changes in the Congress on State's
interests. Rich said the outcome might have an impact on the willingness of the lame duck session to do
anything. Current projections have the House flipping to the Republicans, and Republicans picking up 6-9 seats in the
Senate. If that holds, Republicans are likely to seek immediate adjournment of the lame duck, and we'll need 60 votes
to do anything. Nevertheless, some departing members of Congress will have reason to press to keep things running to
take some action. Work continues on our four outstanding nominations on the Senate floor. Eisen will probably get a
recess appointment; the earliest that could happen would be during the week of 11/22, and such an appointment would
only run through the end of 2011.

Meanwhile, Anne-Marie heard that Berman might unveil legislation in advance of the QDDR announcement to call for
moving all crisis management operations, including VCRS, to USAID. Rich said he expected the full Berman bill on State
authorities would likely not come before the end of the year.

Eric Schwartz thanked AF for its persistence in pressing the Kenyan government to take the 62 African migrants aboard
the USS Pearl Harbor. He also reported on his trip to Afghanistan and Pakistan. He said 100,000 Afghan refugees had
returned from Pakistan in the past year. They need to do a better job of reintegrating those refugees.

Ron Schlicher said President Ahmadinejad would travel to southern Lebanon today. He did not anticipate any incendiary
events, but the visit has put Lebanon in a negative light on the Hill, where the Lowey-Berman holds on USD 100 million
of FMF to Lebanon remain in place.

WHA

The mood in Chile is jubilant following the miners' rescue.

are principally from DoD and focused on Iraq. Phil Goldberg indicated there are reports the head of wikileaks might be
interested in selling some of the documents to foreign bidders.
