Condoleezza Rice hits the trail with Ryan
By EMILY SCHULTHEIS I

Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is heading to Ohio to campaign with Paul Ryan tomorrow, per a
release from the Romney campaign.

The pair will hold a rally at Baldwin Wallace University in Berea, Ohio, just outside of Cleveland.

It's the first time Rice, whose speech in Tampa got a lot of attention, has campaigned with the GOP ticket. And
in the light of the polling that shows Romney gaining among women, she's a helpful surrogate for the campaign
â€” particularly in a state that's so heavily contested by both sides right now.
