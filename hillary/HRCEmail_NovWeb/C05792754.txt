First, as you may have noticed, I am usually pretty quick in responding to emails but this series left me a little
speechless (or maybe in today's lexicon, blackberryless). It really meant a lot coming from the three of you.

Jake, of all the comments yours was the most accurate. Sadly, you are not the first person to point this out as
many people have noted that they picked the wrong half of the couple to be Ambassador.

Second, from bringing snow to Pretoria and sun to Cape Town in the middle of the winter you all turned S
Africa upside down. I know that S Africa and Africa will be a better place as a result of this trip.

Third, having worked in two White Houses and numerous companies, I have never seen a better team. I knew
this from afar as I have seen how the Secretary and you have brought the State Dept to life, from the LES to the
FSOs to the political appointees, everyone feels a part of a team with a clear mission to make America and the
world better. I have not yet talked to anyone in the State Dept who does not feel that and the three of you are
the main reason that this is true (well after the Secretary anyway). Being a part of it firsthand though was
magical and a memory Liz and I will cherish forever. You are a very special team and we are truly honored to
be a part of it.

Fourth, I think all Ambassadors should be warned to take dancing lessons before attending gala dinners with the
Secretary.


Finally, Phillippe, please can I have the Tee-shirt? â€¢

Thank you from Liz and I and I look forward to seeing you all in person again soon.

I associate myself with those remarks, with one addendum - Liz was equally a pleasure to work with and the two of you have an
incredible partnership. (I pretty much think she's the reason you made our hall of fame.)

Ambassador -

We have a tendency to leave a country and say 'Ambassador so and so was the best, wasn't he? We just LOVE Ambassador so and
so"

So, as usual, we got on the plane this morning, and we all said "Don Gips is wonderful, he's our favorite."

But a month from now, we'll be leaving Timor Leste and we'll say, "Wasn't Judith Fergin the best? She's our favorite"

Here's the difference though: while I can't promise you'll keep your #1 status forever, I can safely say that when we all leave State, and
look back at the Secretary's entire tenure, you will absolutely not fall out of the Top 3 Best Ambassadors of All Time That the HRC
Team Worked With.

I'm sorry that distinction doesn't even come with a t-shirt.

But please know it was such a pleasure to work with you and your team, and despite facing just about the toughest challenges we've
ever encountered heading into a country, our time in RSA went off superbly.

See you on the other side,

Philippe
