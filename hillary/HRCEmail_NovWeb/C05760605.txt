Yes -- we're out of slots (and space, but we might be able to fix that)

Is there a reason not to have him -- is it a position issue?

Just wanted to let you know that I talked to him and offered him the consultant position. He said he would be interested
but made clear he was hoping for a full time job. I suggested that many potential jobs would not open up until we had
people in place but that he would get a definite edge by getting in and getting his clearances by working for us. He
seemed ok w/ that, but I just wanted to give u a heads up. AM
