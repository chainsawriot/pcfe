Thank you, Cheryl. That means a lot. It was a huge honor to serve the Secretary, and I learned immeasurably
from you. Thanks for your smart edits, tough love when necessary, and insightful advice.

Best of luck to you, and please feel free to get in touch if I can ever help with anything.

Josh

Thank you so much for all you have done â€” not only in terms of serving the Secretary well, but also the
leadership of and advocacy on behalf of the speechvvriting team. You have been an impeccable partner and I
am grateful for your open, candid and transparent approach. It has helped me strive to do a better job and I will
be eternally grateful for that.



I wish you the best of luck a back west. And if I can ever be of assistance, know that I would be honored to
have the chance to do so.



Best.
