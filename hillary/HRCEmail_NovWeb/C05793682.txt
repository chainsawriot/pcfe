Tom. I wanted to update you on the north korea trip you asked us to postpone because of the south korean presidential elections. I
plan to go the second week in january thru beijing. I will stress that this is a private humanitarian visit for my foundation and if asked
that we are not not carrying any message from the administration. On our own we will urge nuclear restraint and try to help the
american detainee. Upon my return I will be pleased to brief anyone at your request. While this trip may make some people in the
dept. nervous please do not try to organize a campaign to postpone the trip again. I am generally supportive of the admin. policy and
will do no harm. Btw happy holidays and I thought you did well in the cong. Hearings. All the best. Bill.
