That works from my perspective. I defer to Huma on scheduling.

Huma & Jake -

I wanted to let you know that out of my call this morning with E3+3 political directors, there was an
expected strong push from the EU for an E3+3/P5+1 ministerial meeting on Iran at UNGA, chaired by
Cathy Ashton.




The EU has indicated they hope to find a time that works for all of the ministers on Thursday,
September 27th. Russia and China couldn't commit on the phone but agreed to go back and work
on the scheduling. Likewise, I wanted to get this on your radar and ask if you foresee any issues with
finding 30 minutes on the 27th? Thanks very much for consideration.

Best,
Wendy
