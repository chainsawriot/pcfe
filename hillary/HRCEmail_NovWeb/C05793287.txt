Subject: Our Response to the riots -- can I be helpful?

Dear Cheryl and Jake,

Hope you're well. I want to make sure I'm being as helpful as possible in developing our thinking about a mid and long
term strategy following the ongoing riots around the world. In the aftermath of the Danish Cartoon Crisis (which
happened when I was at NSC), I helped develop a way forward on how to respond to the Geert Wilder's film FITNA (the
Dutch film in which they burned a Quran), "Teddybear-Gate" and other incidents that led to widespread protests/riots. I
think I have a perspective that may be of help with the current crisis/way forward.

I do not mean to insert myself into what I know is a politically charged moment managing the USG response, but I want
to make sure that you are aware if there is something I can be doing to be helpful.

I learned a lot through the Danish and Dutch and other incidents and how they spread throughout the Middle East and
Asia and the cycles these things take, especially the messaging challenges our diplomats face on the ground. I also know
how we have approached modulating the USG messaging from short-term needs to a longer-term strategy that I think
could be very helpful as the interagency considers options. I feel it is our moment to use all our knowledge and
experience because we have been here before and we will be here again.

Also, in terms of talking points for the immediate response -- a couple of things that we are NOT saying loud enough:

      •     Parallel to Danish Cartoon — cartoon was out months before a group from Egypt used it to whip people into
            action using emotion not intellect. Same thing happened with this recent film. The film is just a pretext and we
            should draw a clearer line about the linkages.

      •     As I have said to S in several trip Notes—there isn't a place in the world I have gone in which they do not know
            Terry Jones by name. We understand the impact of a random citizen saying/doing something offensive but we
            also know that regular citizens have mobilized to stop violence from happening. Grassroots campaigns are
            incredibly powerful and inspirational and they can suck the oxygen away from the negative stories if promoted
            strategically (witness the "Hug Wilders Campaign," or the "ground zero mosque" campaign by interfaith
            communities). We should think about which of these grassroots organic voices to highlight and how.

      •     The larger issue is the external voices that are paying people to riot, and whipping crowds into action. This frame
            of CT is a stronger narrative that will move people into understanding what is actually taking place. We should
            highlight the elements that are manipulating events so that the "us against them" narrative is neutralized as
            much as possible.

I realize events are moving quickly and that there are conversations about how and what we should be doing. I would be
happy to add my voice and perspective to those discussions if you feel it would be useful.
