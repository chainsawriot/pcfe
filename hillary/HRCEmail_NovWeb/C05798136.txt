we are preparing for sandy here. parts of the city are crazy already. there is a crane on top of a high building on 57th
street that they think is about to fall which is pretty crazy. everything is shut down but its been a good conference call
day!
I talked to chris this morning and she is gathering things for you based on all the the things we discussed. there is a
possibility of 3 nice gowns and a lot of blouses and jackets. i think we should find a day in ny sometime soon so you can
try things on.
Had a long visit with my friend who was in benghazi. will download in person but think very important for you to call
         the injured DS officer. he is now well enough to talk. he doesnt want a visit but a check in call and asking him if
he needs anything would be good. monica will remind you of this.
Also heard from both the bush and reagan libraries over the last few days. neither wants to host the oscar exhibit after it
leaves little rock so i think we will focus on making that exhibit amazing and i will explain situation to odlr.
more later .
