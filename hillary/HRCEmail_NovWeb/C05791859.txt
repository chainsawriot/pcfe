See the email below from Jan Piercy who's been in the Pacific, most recently in New Zealand. Her message is confusing.

Amanda Ellis is the minister for development from NZ. I thought the reason we weren't doing a separate women's event
at the PIF was because Gillard wanted to make her own big gender announcement.

As Melanne well knows, we put gender events on the map in the Pacific. I don't want to be seen as abandoning them
now.

And we certainly have the time to do such an event.
So, what's the story?

Amazingly, I just ran into Amanda ellis in the ANZ airport lounge about to depart for the Cook Islands as I head back to
the US. She said that the gender events are off your schedule. Pls, pls revisit this if at all possible. Your presence will
make all the difference in underscoring significance of focus on gender in this convening. Hope this works out, and hope
change inschedule does not reflect any problems, tho how cld u not be utterly exhausted at this point?
Sending best thoughts, Jan
