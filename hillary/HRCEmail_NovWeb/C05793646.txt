Chelsea, Hannah, and Bai....

I recently became the CEO of Suicide Prevention Initiatives, the leading nonprofit addressing suicide through direct
treatment and research. Suicide is the 8th major cause of death worldwide. SPI's work extends to LGBT youth, college
campuses, and rural China and Vietnam. Over the next year, because of the need, SPI is launching a number of
initiatives to treat Iraq and Afghanistan veterans suffering from Post Traumatic Stress and at risk for suicide.

Today, we now lose more of our young men and women in uniform to suicide than to combat. The stresses of returning
home, often isolated from your band of brothers and sisters, marked by visible and invisible scars of war, to a nation not
at war is an incredible burden to bare. We lose a service member to suicide approximately every 36 hours. In July, the
Army alone lost 33 active and reserve soldiers. And the VA estimates approximately 18 veterans take their lives
everyday. As more American troops return home and transition from war zones, this issue will continue to require our
urgent attention.

I'm currently hiring 2 full time staff members- a COO who must have non-profit financial management training and
experience and a Director of Events and Donor relations. I've attached job descriptions. If you know of anyone, please
send them my way.

Thanks ladies!!
