Subject:                         Question



Sometime on Friday, someone gave me a rosette (for your lapel that usually goes w a medal) which I put on the long
black and white Oscar coat I was wearing and now I can't remember who and where. Can any of you think back to
Friday's schedule and try to remind me???
