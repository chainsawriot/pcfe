Lauren's got it
And I meant to note, this email does double duty - it's essentially your statement to the press (which I'll provide them).
And written as an explanation to staff, allows you to put in context and say things a straight statement couldn't.

Because if this holds until noon, that's after your Zebari avail. You have a camera spray at 2:45 with the DR bilat - but
that's it. So this would be the sum total of what you'd say.
