Wendy: Welcome back. There have been some positive developments in Kampala today in the meeting with
Kagame/Kabila and Museveni. The three leaders issued a statement calling for M-23 to stop their offensive and to
withdraw from Goma and stating that grievances of the M-23 (whether legitimate or not) did not/not justify the
expansion of the conflict or any attempt to overthrow the DRC government. The three presidents resume their
meetings tomorrow. Johnnie

Bill, Wendy and Susan:


FRENCH DISCUSSIONS: I spoke to French Ambassador Delattre at 11:45 this morning (11/21) at Bill's request. Delattre
stressed that France and the U.S. are on the same page with regard to yesterday's UNSCR and asked for my thoughtsbi
the current situation in the DRC and how we can build on yesterday's resolution to address the crisis in eastern DRC. 1.4(B)
also highlighted France's deep concern over eastern DRC's unfolding humanitarian and political crisis. (Comment:
                                                                                                                      1.4(D)

                                                                                                                    B1
I assured Delattre that the U.S. shares France's concerns,
                                                                                                                    1.4(D)
                                          I noted that M23's advance will exacerbate the current humanitarian situat
                                                                                               I acknowledged French FM
Fabius' recent statement about MONUSCO's ineffectiveness,
                                             . Going forward, I said we are hopeful that the current meetings between
Kagame, Kabila, and Museveni in Kampala will produce some progress toward a meaningful regional solution, and I
indentified six next steps to include:




Delattre said he would pass this message back to Paris, reiterated that France and the U.S. are on the same page, and
said again that France is happy with yesterday's UNSCR and believes the resolution provides a good basis for moving
forward. I agreed.                                                                                                            B1
                                                                                                                              1.4(B)
UK DISCUSSIONS: I also just spoke this morning with Nick Kay from the UK Foreign Office. Nick gave me a brief                 1.4(D)
readout of the activities of UK Minister of State for Africa Mark Simmonds, who is currently in Kampala.




                                                                                                         Museveni
insisted that the region can solve it own problems and that outside support is unnecessary. Museveni also hinted that
there may be an extra-ordinary ICGLR session this weekend in Uganda.
                                        Simmonds may see Museveni again this evening or early Thursday morning, and
will then travel to Kigali.




I also raised with Kay the possibility of a joint US-UK-France circuit ride to the region. He agreed this could be helpful,
but suggested waiting until we hear today's pronouncements from Kampala.

I may travel to the region as early as Sunday depending on the outcome of the Kampala meetings. My British colleague
is prepared to travel as well pending the results of his minister's conversations.
