Madame Secretary

I hope you had a great Birthday.

I know EB and others have included talking points on the    deal in Algeria but I wanted to stress its importance in US
jobs and investment in
                                                                                                                          â€¢ B6
I have been briefed by our old friend               of     n its impact for the company's future investments in the          B4
Magreb and meeting the electricity needs of Algeria.
Whoever wins this contract will have a leg up on future deals.                                                      You      B4

Safe trip.

Kris
