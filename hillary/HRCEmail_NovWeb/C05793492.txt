Disappointed NEA Travelers -

As Huma noted, Secretary Clinton was unable to make this week's trip. Obviously, her health is paramount, so we hope
you all understand.

But she nonetheless feels badly that you are all stuck in Washington instead of enjoying Morocco. For some of you it
might have been the first time. And maybe the last time for the rest of us. So if we can't go to Marekesh, she wants to
bring Marekesh to us. Towards that end, she has put together this simulated schedule for tomorrow:



Notes to the Party:

• NO/NO Bag Drag tomorrow
• Weather: mostly cloudy with temps in the upper 40s • Money Matters: yes, in this country as in all others, money does
matter • Vendors will be conveniently located on the ground floor of HST selling used books, used lamps, used
birdcages, and an assortment of other random household items from the 1970s • Note: You can simultaneously donate
blood at the same location • Note: Yoga will simultaneously be offered at the same location • Water in DC is NOT/NOT
Potable



- 10:00am Meet at 22nd & C Lobby of HST



- 10:15am Staff Vans Depart HST ert IAD



- 11:00am Arrive Dulles International Airport

[Note: We will not be flying anywhere, but our bodies are programmed to spend at least two hrs/per day in a van]



- 11:00am-11:30am Lunch at IAD Long Term Parking

• Note: A Bag Lunch will be served

• [Additional Note: on the side of the bag there will inexplicably be an imprint of a symbol of some kind that appears to
be nothing more than a red splotch] • Parmessan Crusted Baked Tilapia Salad garnished with Blue Cheese, Asiago
Cheese, Provolone Cheese, Mozzarella Cheese, and Stuffed Shells Stuffed w/Red Wine Reduction Crusted Musht • A Loaf
of Bread • Side Salad of Mini Eclairs • Dessert of fried fruit • Beverage Service: Random concoction of a Fruit Juice Mixed
with Seltzer (though somehow - despite a finite # of types of juices and mixes available in society - will never have been
served on any previous flight, nor will it be served on any subsequent flight)



- 11:30am Depart IAD ert 1601 21st St NW, Washington DC

NOTE: A Light Snack will be served during this van movement • Jalapeno and Blue Cheese Tilapia Burger Topped with
Thick Maple Bacon, Even Thicker Sausages, and Chocolate Chip Italian Ices • Medley of Squash, Zucchini, Almond Green
Beans, and Key Lime Pie • Roasted Red Pepper Hummus Spinach Parfait • Dessert: Cannoli Stuffed w/Tilapia



- 12:15pm Meet & Greet w/Embassy Washington

[Note: This is actually The Kingdom of Morocco's Embassy to the United States]



- 3:30pm Camera Spray w/Cathy Ashton



- 4:30pm Press Conference w/Cathy Ashton



- 5:00pm Team w/Cathy Ashton in Three-Legged Charity Race

[Note: Proceeds from race with go to the Help The Lady Buy Her Own Plane fund]



- 5:30pm Roundtable Discussion w/Cathy Ashton to discuss why whenever they are physically in the same place -
whether Brussels or Los Cabos - with cameras around, she has urgent business to conduct with the Secretary - but they
never seem to speak on the phone in between trips.



- Time TBD: We have identified 17 locations for dinner, and each location is holding a table of 30 'just in case' the
Secretary's party drops by: http://www.urbanspoon.com/m/c/7/moroccan. The Secretary's name was NOT/NOT used
so it is unknown how they know she *might* be coming at exactly 7:23:47pm wearing a white jacket over black pantsuit
and prefers to look out the window. As part of deceiving the restaurant, the reservation is NOT/NOT under her name.
You must tell them you are with the Hillary Clunkton party. Please be ready to mobilize at the drop of a hat, at a time
not of your choosing that has no correlation to your appetite status. Additionally, you should be ready to leave dinner at
a moment's notice, the only warning being Ms. Clunkton's suddenly standing up and the resulting sound of 29 chairs
moving away from the table. From that point, you will have 90 seconds to get to the vans.



- OPTIONAL: For those interested we have secured a van to take you to the History of the Air Force's Obsession with
Tilapia Museum, located on the grounds of Joint Base Andrews. During this visit, you will learn many fun facts about
Tilapia:

• Tilapia is not a single fish. It is the common name for nearly a hundred species of cichlid fish from the tilapiine cichlid
tribe.

• Tilapia can become problematic invasive species in new warm-water habitats, whether deliberately or accidentally
introduced.

• Tilapia were one of the three main types of fish caught in Biblical times from the Sea of Galilee. At that time were
called Musht.

• Tilapia typically have laterally compressed, deep bodies. Like other cichlids, their lower pharyngeal bones are fused
into a single tooth-bearing structure. A complex set of muscles allows the upper and lower pharyngeal bones to be used
as a second set of jaws for processing food, allowing a division of labor between the "true jaws" (mandibles) and the
"pharyngeal jaws".

• Their mouths are protrusible, usually bordered with wide and often swollen lips. The jaws have conical teeth.

• In Kenya tilapia were introduced to control mosquitoes which were causing malaria, because they consume mosquito
larvae, consequently reducing the numbers of adult female mosquitoes, the vector of the disease.

• Tilapia are on the IUCN's 100 of the World's Worst Alien Invasive Species list.

• In the United States, tilapia are found in much of Florida, Texas and a few other isolated areas, such as power plant
discharge zones.

• Larger tilapia species are generally poor community aquarium fish because they eat plants, dig up the bottom, and
fight with other fish.

• China is the largest tilapia producer in the world, followed by Egypt.

• In modern aquaculture, wild-type Nile tilapia are not too often seen, as the dark color of their flesh is not much
desired by many customers, and because it has a bit of a reputation of being a trash fish associated with poverty.

• The lower amounts of omega-3 and the higher ratios of omega-6 fats in US-farmed tilapia raised questions about the
health benefits of consuming farmed tilapia fish. Some media reports even controversially suggested that farm-raised
tilapia may be worse for the heart than eating bacon or a hamburger. This prompted the release of an open letter,
signed by 16 science and health experts from around the world, that stated that both oily (i.e. high in omega-3 fatty
acids) fish and lean fish like tilapia are an important part of the diet and concluded that "replacing tilapia or catfish with
'bacon, hamburgers or doughnuts' is absolutely not recommended."

The Secretarys doctor says she cannot travel tomorrow. Given the timing of the Friends of Syria meeting, we are asking
Deputy Burns to represent her on trip. So there will be no departure tomorrow with S. She will be totally fine, she's just
not recovered enough to leave tomorrow.
