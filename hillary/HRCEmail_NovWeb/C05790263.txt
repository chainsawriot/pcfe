Flagging for you



PESHAWAR (AP) - A government official says a Pakistani doctor who helped the U.S. track down Osama bin Laden has
been convicted of high treason and sentenced to 33 years in prison.

  Nasir Khan says Shakil Afridi was also ordered Wednesday to pay a fine of about $3,500. If he doesn't pay, he will
spend another three and half years in prison.

  Khan is a government official in Pakistan's Khyber tribal area, where Afridi was tried.

  Afridi ran a vaccination program for the CIA to collect DNA and verify bin Laden's presence at the compound in the
town of Abbottabad, where he was killed last May by U.S. commandos.

 U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has called for Afridi to be released, saying his work served Pakistani and
American interests.
