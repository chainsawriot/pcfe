I know this wasnt intentional but now that everyone has been looped into the additonal stops, posts and press
are asking questions. So Pd like to suggest the following.
Pick what you prefer between what we discussed. If you decide you dont want to add any or all of these
countries, ideally we pull the plug so the speculation stops. We can also ask Jonathan when he will be in Abuja.
Benin will make anything work.
Both options are feasible. Option 1 preserves your time in Capetown. You get home the same time.
