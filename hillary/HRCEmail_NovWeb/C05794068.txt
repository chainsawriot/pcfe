Subject: UN Security Council suspends Gaza debate (AP)

UNITED NATIONS (AP)        Consultations set for 3 p.m. (2000 GMT) Wednesday. UN chief to report to council
by videoconfrence at 3:30 p.m. (2030 GMT).
   With a cease-fire announced in the Gaza crisis, the Security Council suspended a formal open debate that
had been scheduled for Wednesday afternoon.

The council has been silent since Israel launched air raids on Hamas in Gaza, responding to months of Hamas
rocket fire into Israel.

  Instead, the council will hold closed consultations, then hear a report by videoconference from Secretary-
General Ban Ki-moon, who has been talking with leaders in the Middle East on the crisis.
