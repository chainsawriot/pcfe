Subject: Update: Post 2015 panel

Cheryl,

Here is an update:
After the Rio+20 conference, Susan Rice suggested one more round of discussion on the U.S. participant on the
panel. USUN/NY is working on a short paper laying out the issues and background, as well as factoring in conversations
Elizabeth Cousens has had with the UK and Indonesia at Rio. This paper would be the basis for a decision.

At the July 2 9:15am senior staff meeting, the Secretary said that Ban had asked her when would the U.S. provide a
name for the high level panel. (They were both at the June 30 Geneva meeting on Syria.) I responded that we would
move ahead with interagency conversations and recommend a name.

Cheryl,
At the Rio+20 conference USUN/NY's Elizabeth Cousens had further conversations with the UK and Indonesia (2 of the 3
co-chair countries) about the nature of the panel. USUN/NY will prepare a paper based the new information. We would
have another round of conversation and set up the options for decision. Looks like the specific names will not be

announced at the conference after all. However, jockeying for positions is under way. The U.S. delegation will make
clear that the U.S. does want a seat on the panel.

Cheryl,
It is a more informal process. The SYG makes the appointment. He would like a U.S. participant and would appoint our
preferred person. Susan would convey in NY.

Cheryl,
I would like to check whether there were any additional guidance on this point. I understand that you would be raising
with S. The UN Secretary-General plans to announce to members of the panel at the upcoming Rio+20 conference (the
leaders have already been announced). We would need to confirm to Susan the name of the USG candidate.

Cheryl,
Thank you for joining this afternoon's call. I wanted to follow up to check if you have a preferred person to serve for the
USG on the post-2015 MDG panel or if you have other views on this issue of which I should be aware.
