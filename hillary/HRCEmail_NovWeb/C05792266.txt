Agreed! I'm out at the Aspen Strategy Group and Nick Kristof suggested to me that if you were to have your own Twitter
account (the way Carl Bildt does, where HE tweets rather than having an official account), it would have a huge impact
on govt-to-society diplomacy for the rest of your term. Imagine the sense of people around the world that you really are
speaking directly to them. It's no harder than sending a short email. Wd be easy to set up.
Best,

What a funny term for such an important development in diplomacy, but probably better that "twitplomacy"!

        I tweeted it out and it was immediately picked up by Ambassador Rao, who sent it out with the
        following comment:

        `article on "twiplomacy" as new way to look at our diplomatic agendas and engage with less traditional
        players.'

        Might make sense for you to have a round-table w/ DC ambassadors on how to do govt-to-society
        diplomacy. Very interesting that India would pick up on this.
