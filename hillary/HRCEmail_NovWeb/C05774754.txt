NOTE FOR THE SECRETARY




FROM:     DRL—Assistant Secretary Michael H. Posner




SUBJECT: China Human Rights Discussions




Working closely with EAP, I will host the Obama Administration's first Human Rights Dialogue (HRD) with China in
Washington May 13-14, fulfilling President Obama's agreement with Hu Jintao during his November China trip to host
hold the next round in 2010. The HRD is an important step towards reinvigorating our engagement on human rights with
China. (Note: I've sent a request for you to welcome the Chinese delegation May 13). The Chinese delegation head is
MFA Director General Chen, whose position is equivalent to an Assistant Secretary.




                           I hope to host a delegation dinner at the Newseum to underscore the priority we place on
freedom of expression, including internet freedom. As of Friday the Chinese delegation had not agreed to that location.
We will also meet with Sandra Day O'Connor at the Supreme Court and smaller working groups will visit a faith-based
charity (organized by Cardinal McCarrick), a food safety NGO, and a labor rights site – all to demonstrate in tangible
ways how we implement these important human rights issues on a daily basis.




I also plan to join you in Beijing and attend and participate in the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&ED) on
May 24-25.




                                                                                     Please let me know if you want
additional information on any of these points.
