Subject: (Reuters) - Afghan soldier killed U.S. trainers in argument


KABUL - The killing of two U.S. civilian trainers by an Afghan soldier at a base in northern Afghanistan was the result of a
"verbal argument", the Afghan Defense Ministry said. On July 20, the NATO-led force said two U.S. civilians and an
Afghan soldier had been killed in a shooting by another Afghan soldier, possibly an officer, but could not say whether the
deaths were an accident or had been intentional. The shooting happened after an argument broke out between an
Afghan soldier and U.S. instructors at a training center on an Afghan army base in northern Balkh province, the defense
ministry said.
