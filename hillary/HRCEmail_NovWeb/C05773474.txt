I've mentioned to many of you individually but wanted to be sure I shared my DC days with everyone. I plan to be at
State on Tuesdays and Thursdays when HRC is in the office. The days may vary depending on events taking place at State
that I need to be around for. Thanks for your collective patience as I've tried to navigate through this crazy and fun
transition in my life!
