Subject: Flash flood kills 19 in Afghanistan; many missing (AP)

KABUL (AP) - Flood waters have ravaged a provincial capital in northern Afghanistan, killing at least 19
people and destroying hundreds of homes.
   Sayed Faizullah Sadat, the national disaster director in Sar-e-Pul province, said Sunday that 60 other people
are missing and rescuers are looking for them across the city.
   The flooding began on Saturday in Sayyad district and then washed out most of the capital city of Sar-e-Pul.
   Sadat says 1,000 houses have been destroyed and 10,000 people have found shelter in mosques, schools and a
teacher-training center.
   Flash flooding also killed two other people in the past two days in northern Talchar province.
   Northern Afghanistan gets hit nearly every spring by flash flooding from heavy rains and snow melting off
the mountains.
