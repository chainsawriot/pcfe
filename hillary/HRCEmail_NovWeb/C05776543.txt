FYI – see below a note from Frist's MCC guy (who was also at Oxford with me)

Senator Frist asked me to convey to the Secretary on his behalf that he has decided not to seek a second term on the
MCC board when his current term expires this November. He's been weighing the decision carefully for several months,
and ultimately reached the conclusion that because MCC is in good shape in terms of both Administration and
Congressional support—compared to when we started in late 2007—he feels that it is the right moment to reallocate his
time to some other initiatives and projects that he has had to decline or delay, many in the global health and
development area. The September 15th board meeting will be our last.




He would have gotten in touch personally, but he is travelling with his family in Africa and the UK until next week, and he
wanted her to hear the news from him first. He says that he of course looks forward to continuing to work with her on
issues they have discussed.




He has let MCC CEO Daniel Yohannes and Senator McConnell know, and I have begun the process of informing other
board members via Plus Ones. I was waiting to speak with you before contacting others at State, but will begin to do so.




Talk to you soon—
