Checking now. He left a pouch at your residence of the items you can keep.

You'll notice on the schedule in your pouch from the office, that the Somali president is listed at 2:45. We are hoping to
move that to 3pm in case Day goes long. Is that OK with you?

I just woke up so I missed Dan. Could he come back after I finish my calls? But I don't have the call schedule yet so I don't
know when that would be. Do you?
