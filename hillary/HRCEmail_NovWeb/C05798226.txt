The uncompelling quality of the first CFR speech is painful.

Sandy's point is that the first speech was highly conventional (and a bit pedestrian). This one was cutting edge.

 Awesome. Reread your first CFR speech 3 years ago -- evolution reflects the transformative effect you have had on US
 foreign policy/DOS over these four years.
