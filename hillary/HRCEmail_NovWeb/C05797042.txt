Hillary, Holly and I send best wishes for a swift return to full duty. We have been concerned by the news in the
past week or so, but reassured in the last 24 hours. We are among innumerable others, I'm sure, who have you
in our thoughts and prayers. Best wishes for a quick recovery and best wishes, as well, for a great new year. It
was a privilege to serve our country with you in 2011 and 2012 -- Dave Petraeus
