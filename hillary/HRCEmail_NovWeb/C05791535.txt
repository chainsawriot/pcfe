Subject: Data Speech

I wanted to send my personal thanks to each of you for all of your help on the gender data speech. We have heard rave
reviews about the speech and the conference. In Maggie's words, I think we managed to make data "sexy" (or at least pretty
interesting). Thanks for all that you each did to make this happen.

Best,
Jen
