Subject: Shafik campaign says ahead in Egypt vote race (Reuters)

CAIRO (Reuters) - Hosni Mubarak's last prime minister, Ahmed Shafiq, is beating "beyond all doubt" the
Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Morsy in the presidential vote, Shafiq's campaign said, disputing the Islamist
group's claim that its candidate had won the election.

   "The initial indications of the Ahmed Shafiq campaign prove beyond all doubt that he is ahead in the
elections despite all the violations," a spokesman for his campaign said in a statement. He said Shafiq had won
between 51 percent and 52 percent of the vote.
