Team

I extended an offer to Bernadette Meehan to be the S special and she accepted.

Please congratulate her.

We are still interviewing for the second slot and anticipate being in a position to extend an offer tomorrow after Huma's
Interview.

Alice â€” if you have not yet had occasion to interview the second candidate we are focused on, please coordinate with
Huma or Joe to get his resume and reach out to speak with him tomorrow.

Best.
