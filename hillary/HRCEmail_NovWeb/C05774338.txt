I think this is good copy.

I actually think we should do a what is required from you type asst meeting a presntation tailored for that w/ clear
expectations and make sure that gets around the building.

Likely needs to be the week after next though given her travel unless we could do next tue w/ canx of St petersburg if that
happens

Maria talked to me today and pointed out that in yesterday's briefing everyone was engaged except
the power center of State â€” the regional asst. secretaries. Neither Bill Burns nor Jim was there (Bill
was out of town), which of course sends a signal re whether to take this seriously. And folks like
     looked completely bored. (Johnnie and Bill Blake, of course, are the exceptions.) She makes
an impt point re actually changing this place; I'm wondering if S shouldn't send a.really strong
signal at one of the Tues. asst. sec meetings that she would chair and we could talk about
implications of QDDR for P. AM
