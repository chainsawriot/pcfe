FIRST LOOK - cover of Sunday's Parade, "An exclusive conversation with President and Mrs. [George
H.W. Bush]: At home in Kennebunkport, Maine, with [dogs] Bibi and Mini-Me Bush ... Nineteen years after
leaving the White House, George H. W. Bush, 88, is seeing his legacy burnished. In an exclusive interview in
this Sunday's issue of PARADE, the former president and his wife, Barbara, 87, share with presidential
historian Mark Updegrove their extraordinary journey and their take on today's politics":

PRESIDENT BUSH 41, on Grover Norquist's no-new-taxes pledge for Republican candidates: "The
rigidity of those pledges is something I don't like. The circumstances change and you can't be wedded to some
formula by Grover Norquist. It's-who the hell is Grover Norquist, anyway?"

BARBARA BUSH: "I think he ought to go back to Alaska. [laughs] Don't quote me!" [A reference to a
comment Mrs. Bush made about Sarah Palin in a 2010 interview, in which she said, "I think she's very happy in
Alaska-and I hope she'll stay there."]

BARBARA BUSH, on 43: "Every day we were proud of him. Of course, 9/11 ... I think George's [leadership
after] 9/11 was brilliant. I think it was a high point, just as the day the war started when you were president,
trying to liberate Kuwait-that first day was a high point. There were not many civilians hurt, which was very
important."

41, on what he learned from President Reagan when he was his V.P.: "Decency, honor, and kindness. ... He
didn't care about the day-to-day legislation and amending the previous motion and all that kind of stuff. He was
broad-gauged.

41, on his friendship with President Bill. Clinton: "Well, he knows a lot about everything. He's a yeti
knowledgeable, bright man. He sat out here one time, and we talked about every possible [subject]_one after
another.",

BARBARA BUSH: "But he never said a mean word about anyone. '[My] brother by an6ther mother,' the bo)4,
call him. But he's very nice-I think he thinks of George as the father he never had Truthfully. I mean that as a
compliment. He's been very thoughtful about calling and he's a good fellow."1
