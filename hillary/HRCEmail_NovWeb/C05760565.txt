Farah:

I have had occasion to review the memo, as has the Secretary. I appreciate you also speaking with
Maggie. We are excited to move forward with this opportunity.

To do so, I would like you to undertake the:

               o    Please prepare a draft position description, set of objectives and proposed staff you may
                    require (don't get happy!), which I will modify to be consistent with you to be consistent with
                    the Secretary's goals.
               o    Let's then meet (Lori will arrange time) to discuss the description, objectives and any staffing.

                                                                            4

           o   Then, I want you to meet with the Secretary and with several other folks here and at the White
               House (in advance we will advise them you are being appointed to this role, share the
               description with them, and that we want them to have occasion to meet you), prior to us
               announcing your role.

In the interim, you will be continued at the Department and once your position is announced, appropriate
personnel adjustments will be made. My goal is to undertake these tasks in the next two weeks so we can get
you launched.

Please let me know if for any reason you do not wish to go forward. I am enormously excited as is the
Secretary — she is so pleased you are willing to undertake this important responsibility and that someone with
talent, creativity, intelligence and enthusiasm will be assuming this important role.
