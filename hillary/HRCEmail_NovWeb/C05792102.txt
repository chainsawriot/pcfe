Ms. Hanley,

We reached out to Former President Mbeki's staff, who informed us that he is currently flying in transit to Johannesburg
and will land between 0800 EDT/ 1400 Johannesburg and 0900 EDT/1500 Johannesburg. The staffer who handles his
scheduling is on the plane with him. We will continue to reach out to his staff when he lands.

Thank you,

Jim Jay
