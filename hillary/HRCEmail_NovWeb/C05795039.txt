Thanks again for coming to the conference. It is really appreciated arid obviously a good cause and a good
podium. Audience will be a mix of high-value donors to the museum and foreign policy elites from the Hill, think tanks,
and college groups online and there. CNN is the media partner to the event so we have some good built in coverage.

If someone is assigned to work on the speech I should be happy to help with some points if you put me through Philippe
or someone else to make some suggestions on it.

I've done a pro-bono poll on knowledge about genocide and I'll be presenting that to the conference and can get the
results to you and whoever would work on the speech â€” so far in the early interviews the public wants more multilateral,
not unilateral efforts when it comes to stopping genocide. Awareness of events was surprisingly high.

I'm doing a small reception at my home the night before for speakers and museum board, etc. and the should you be in
DC, of course delighted if you feel in the mood to stop by briefly.
