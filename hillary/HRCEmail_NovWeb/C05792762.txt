Subject: Russia's Medvedev hints of Chinese threat to Far East (Reuters)

MOSCOW, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on Thursday issued a veiled warning about
China's rising influence in Russia's resource-rich Far East, saying it was essential to defend the area against
"excessive expansion by bordering states".

   Speaking days after Russia's first deputy defence minister said two new nuclear submarines would be sent to
the Pacific Fleet, Medvedev also said it was "important not to allow negative manifestations ... including the
formation of enclaves made up of foreign citizens."

    His comments, some of the strongest on the subject yet, underlined the Kremlin's suspicions that a steady
influx of Chinese migrants may ultimately pose a threat to Russian hegemony in the remote and sparsely
populated territories of Siberia and the Far East.
