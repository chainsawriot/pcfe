When Bill Clinton held a Ugandan newborn in his arms during a trip to East Africa in 1998, the mother decided
to name him after the president.

Now 14 and hoping to become a surgeon, Bill Clinton Kaligani — who considers the ex-president his "dad" -
was overjoyed when he was reunited with his namesake.

"I feel good. He told me he also wanted me to be a doctor, that I should work hard and pass in my studies," he
said, according to the Daily Monitor.

Bubba and daughter Chelsea were in Uganda for his Clinton Foundation last month, winding up an African tour
that took them to Mozambique, Lesotho, Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda and South Africa.

It was his first visit to Uganda since March 24, 1998, when he toured the village of Wanyange and met Betty
Namugosa, who had just given birth to her fourth child.

"I decided to call him Bill, and if it was a girl, I would have named her Hillary," she said.Namugosa exchanged
letters with Clinton after but eventually lost contact, she said.

The teen Bill had said he wanted to see the ex-president.

"I grew up knowing he is my dad after getting his name when he visited and carried me in his arms when I was
just 4 days old," he said, according to AllAfrica.com.

Uganda's former president sent a private helicopter to bring the boy to Entebbe for the reunion. He was
supposed to be taking a history test, but under orders from the capital, Kampala, a police escort took him and
his mom to an airfield for their first flight ever.

The former president spent an hour with them.

"[Clinton] was very happy to see the boy," Namugosa said. "He promised to look after his 'son' in every way."
