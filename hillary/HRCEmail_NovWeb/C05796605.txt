WOW. Last time I saw you was three years ago this month. So much extraordinary work since then!

I can't imagine you have a minute or that you might be in DC next week but figured if I didn't ask I
wouldn't know. I am in DC next Friday - before starting to drive

This email is as much to say happy holidays (if you get to even notice there are holidays) as it is to
think we might say a quick hello in person.

Much affection, Gina

P.S. Bumped into            and am trying to convince her to think about going on the Planned Parenthood
board.




The future of women's health is in our hands.

Join me in making a special gift to Planned Parenthood Action Fund.
