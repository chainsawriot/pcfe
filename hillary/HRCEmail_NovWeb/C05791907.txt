Works for me. Adding Bill, although I believe he is mercifully away from a secure phone.

Good news all around.

Also, copying Jake, what about an 11:00am secure call tomorrow among us (do you want to add Bill or anyone else?)

Madam Secretary,
Jacques emailed me this morning and Rosemary has now confirmed with Araud that the French have dropped any idea
of a resolution so you do not/not have to call FM Fabius. Enjoy your day.
Best,
Wendy
