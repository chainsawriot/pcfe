OK. Much as I'd like to say that I traveled w/S I think there's going to be a lot to sort through on Libya on Monday, so I
think my time better spent in DC.

Separately, I wanted to flag some issues from my conversation w/Tim that Leahy intended to raise w/S. He had wanted
to take advantage of Granger's presence to discuss the consular access issue to try to get Granger, w/help from 5, to
agree to carry his language in the omnibus approps bill they hope to complete during lame duck. Similarly, he wanted to
press Granger on UNESCO waiver language.

Now that she will not be there, I suspect he'll stick to his usual requests for action on the landmine treaty and some sort
of dramatic change in our Cuba policy.

Chairwoman Granger's Chief of Staff just called me - she has taken ill and will not be able to travel on Monday.

She appreciates the invitation and all that we have done to assist.


Thanks
Jennifer
