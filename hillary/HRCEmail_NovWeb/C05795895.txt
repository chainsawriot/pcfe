Not sure if you saw the below item, but I think you should be strong and clear with Zardari on Monday. It is totally
unacceptable for a sitting government minister to put a bounty on the head of an American citizen, and call for Al Qaeda
to assassinate him.


â€¢ (U) Pakistani Railways Minister Bilour offered a $100,000 reward for the death of the maker of the
inflammatory video. Bilour told reporters he would pay the bounty out of his own pocket, and suggested the
Taliban and al-Qaida would also be eligible to receive the reward. (BBC)
