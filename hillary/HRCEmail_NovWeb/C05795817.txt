From Johnnie:

Re Amb Entwistle's comments: Kabila and the DRC feel like the aggrieved party; their territory has been invaded; their
army routed; his political position undermined. The Group of Experts have certified Rwandan involvement; the UK and
others have spoken out against Rwanda; and at least a half dozen or more Eurropean countries, including the Uk,
Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands have suspended aid to Rwanda because of the allegations of support. Kabila
would like us to be more public BUT I DO NOT THINK WE HAVE LOSS OUR INFLUENCE OR CREDIBILITY WITH HIM. IF WE
HAVE IT IS MARGINAL AND REPAIRABLE. We have done a lot for him, including train his battalion of troops, responded
too his requests to engage the Rwandans -- which we have done. The one thing we have not done is to go out as publicly
in our condemnation of Rwanda -- like our British and European colleagues.
