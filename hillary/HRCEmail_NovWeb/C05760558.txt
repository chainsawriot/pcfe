Hi Cheryl,

I just wanted to write you a quick email thanking you for all your help during my job search. I've really appreciated all
your assistance and patience throughout the entire process.

Over the course of the last several days, I've had a couple of really good conversations with Rich Verma and am looking
forward to joining his team. He seems like a great guy and I'm eager to learn from him.

Also, I wanted to single out Laura, Heather, and Pat Carter from HR, each of whom have been tremendously helpful and
patient as well. They've been great to work with.

Thank you again, and I look forward to joining you all next week.
