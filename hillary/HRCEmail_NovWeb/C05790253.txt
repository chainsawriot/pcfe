Good Morning Madam Secretary-Just a quick note on today's hearing. Our bed check last night revealed that the
hearing will be relatively well attended and that members are focused on the substance at hand.

That said, I did want to flag a couple of non-treaty items that members may raise.
                                There is q and a in the global section of your book.

Also, given that Senators Menendez and Rubio are on the committee,
                                                                                         There is q and a in your
book on those as well. Dave
