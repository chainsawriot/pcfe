Jan--

I'm not sure what Amanda Ellis means. As far as my team knows, we are still doing a women's event but the details are
not set yet. Which, given that it's a week away, is par for our planning.

I'm copying Huma and Lona so if you hear anything else, please let all three of us know.

Safe travels---H

Amazingly, I just ran into Amanda ellis in the ANZ airport lounge about to depart for the Cook Islands as I head back to
the US. She said that the gender events are off your schedule. Pls, pis revisit this if at all possible. Your presence will
make all the difference in underscoring significance of focus on gender in this convening. Hope this works out, and hope
change inschedule does not reflect any problems, tho how cld u not be utterly exhausted at this point?
Sending best thoughts, Jan
