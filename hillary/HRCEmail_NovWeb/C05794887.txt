MS, in case you didn't see the recent job news about your neighbor.

EXCLUSIVE : Wayne Berman, one of Washington's best-known Republican wisemen, is going in-house with
the Blackstone Group as a senior adviser, after more than a decade of representing the private-equity giant as a
consultant and lobbyist. Berman will depart shortly from Ogilvy Government Relations, where he has been
chairman since 2005. He will continue to serve on the board of directors of Highstar Capital, the infrastructure
advisory firm. Berman, a Rochester native, is a key fundraiser for Mitt Romney, and was Assistant Secretary of
Commerce for Policy under President George H.W. Bush. His wife, Lea Berman, was White House social
secretary under President George W. Bush.
