I agree. I've been giving a lot of thought to this and plan to send you something shortly. I ran into Johnnie
Carson at the Wharton swearing in yesterday and had a brief discussion with him about it.

I stopped by your office but you were in a meeting. Hope to see you soon so we can catch up.

Take care.
