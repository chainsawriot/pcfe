I don't know how you find the time to write us when you are so busy saving the world! You are the one who is
amazing. Good luck with LavroV. It is such important work. Hope you get to take a long nap when this is over.
Have a great holiday season. We will be at Renaissance weekend this year. Best to WJC and Chelsea. Much love.

With best wishes,

Joe Wilson
