For the record, here is what POTUS said at last year's UNGA address.

We will support the Millennium Development Goals, and approach next year's summit with a global plan to
make them a reality. And we will set our sights on the eradication of extreme poverty in our time.

Bono wrote a NYT column referring to them as "Obama's 36 words."

He wrote:
"In the fight against extreme poverty, it's action, not intentions, that counts. That stirring sentence he uttered
last month will ring hollow unless he returns to next year's United Nations summit meeting with a meaningful,
inclusive plan, one that gets results for the billion or more people living on less than $1 a day. Difficult. Very
difficult. But doable."
