Subject: Parents of Austin Tice in Beirut (NOW Lebanon)



BEIRUT (NOW Lebanon) - The mother and father of Austin Tice, the 31-year-old former US Marine and freelance journalist who went
missing while in Syria in August, held a press conference in Beirut on Monday to appeal "to anyone and everyone who can put us into
contact with our son," as Debra Tice put it before a crowd of assembled reporters.

Debra Tice and her husband Mark, pressed repeatedly for details, spoke in generalities when discussing whom they've been talking
to thus far to secure Austin's release. In October, following the YouTube release of a video showing Tice, a U.S. State
Department spokeswoman said, "To the best of our knowledge, we think he is in Syrian government custody."

Asked about why the State Department believed this and whether or not the family shared that opinion, Debra Tice told NOW, "We
are separate from State, and we have been very careful to avoid speculation. We do not know who is holding him, and so our mission
here is to reach out to whoever it is, without trying to guess who that might be."
