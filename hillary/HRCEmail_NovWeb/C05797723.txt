I am working very closely now with American Bridge. I dictated a script for Cher for an ad on women,
will learn whether she agreed to do it; ordered a reel on Republican outrageous comments on women,
which is done and will soon be released; number of other things TBD later, whatever I can think of.
It's hit and miss.
Biden needs to raise his decibel level on Republican rape rage and Romney as supporter, enabler and
Profile in Cowardice. To wit:

Will tell Klain and John Martilla (who remains close to Biden).
Can you get all the Democratic women senators to issue a joint statement about the Republican rape
rage, women's rights and Romney's enabling and cowardice?
This fire needs gas.
