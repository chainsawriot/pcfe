Bill Clinton, will.i.am headline Charlotte party

Bill Clinton and Black Eyed Peas musician will.i.am are hoping to party like it's 1992.

They're teaming up at a Democratic Party of Arkansas fundraising event next Tuesday during the
Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C.

Clinton will be celebrating the 20-year anniversary of his nomination as the Democratic Party's
presidential nominee â€” hence the event's title, "A Party Two Decades in the Making."

Tickets to the event, which is scheduled for 5 p.m. on Sept. 4 at the Westin Charlotte, start at $150.

Clinton is also scheduled to speak during prime time at the convention itself.
