I just wanted to let all of you know that                                      called back at 3:40pm today to thank the
Secretary for her condolence call earlier today.
                 I did tell her that the Secretary spoke with                                 She was aware of that.

FYI â€” the Secretary has not yet spoken with                     I have the name and number on the call grid.
