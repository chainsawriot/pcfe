This is an update

UNC passed a message to KPA notifying them of the termination of the ROK LFX at 4:54p.m. local time. UNC may also
issue a press statement (if the ROKs do so first). In the interim, they will use the below "response to questions" points,
which summarize the LFX:

--A multinational group of United Nations Command military personnel travelled to Yeonpyeong Island to observe a
scheduled live-fire exercise by Republic of Korea forces.

--Firing began at 2:30 p.m. and concluded at approximately 4 p.m.

--The UNC and our international partners share a strong common interest in maintaining peace and stability in northeast
Asia.

--UNC observation team members included representatives from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the Republic of the
Philippines, the Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States.


                                                                                                              Your
