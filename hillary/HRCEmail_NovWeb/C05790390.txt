• Ferraro: WJC appointed her as a US Ambassador to the UN Commission on Human Rights from '93 to '96; she helped
lead the US delegation to the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995

• Bergen/Embassy Bombings (pir put together from various online sources): the Secretary accompanied President
Clinton to the 8/14/98 ceremony at Andrews Air Force Base marking the return of the remains of ten of the Americans
killed. (There were 12 US citizens killed, one was buried in Kenya, the other, a member of the Air Force was flown
directly to Florida at the family's request). Albright actually accompanied the bodies on the 10 hour flight from
Ramstein, Germany to AAFB, aboard a C-17 named the "Spirit of America's Veterans". Before the bodies arrived, WJC &
HRC met for an hour with about 60 relatives of the dead who were sitting at tables that the Clinton's walked to one at a
time, in a closed off area of the hangar. Busloads of State personnel attended. The flag draped caskets were unloaded
one at a time by an 8-member honor guard representing all the services - also bearing the flags of Kenya and Tanzania -
and placed in individual hearses. "Nearer My God to Thee" and "America the Beautiful" were played. WJC spoke (HRC
definitely did not at the ceremony, and I'm not finding any separate statements from the time). After the 45 min
ceremony, the bodies were reloaded from the hearses onto a plane and flown to Dover, at which point they were flown
onward to the families. (The ceremony was held at AAFB instead of Dover because the victims had so many ties to DC).
In addition to his remarks at the ceremony, WJC recorded a video message to the people of Africa (245 Africans died,
5000 wounded), and then delivered a separate Oval Office address. Referring to his meeting with the families at AAFB,
he said "They made it clear to me they did not want us to give in to terror or to turn inward or retreat." He later
approved waivers to allow three of the Americans killed in Nairobi to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery (as they
were non-military, he had to issue waivers; those killed who were military or veterans didn't require waivers).
