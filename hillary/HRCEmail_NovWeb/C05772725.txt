Subject: Update on Science Advisor

Cheryl,

Yesterday Kern-Ann completed the interviews for the candidates for the Science Advisor (we have one outstanding who
has not responded and probably is not interested, but we are still trying to connect with her). We are now reviewing
references, which will take this week and next.
We will then give you the final candidates for this position, most likely four, whom Kern-Ann and I will rank.
The candidates are strong and very qualified (three men, two of them minorities, and one woman) but they have very
different science orientations and backgrounds. Selection will require more guidance on the Secretary's preferences
regarding the Science Advisor's role. We recommend we invite two for face-to-face interviews.
All candidates are prepared to move to Washington and are available to begin the first quarter of 2011.

Thanks,
Maria
