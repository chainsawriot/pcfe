  Subject: Russia will not deliver fighter jets to Syria -RIA (Reuters)

     July 9 (Reuters) - Russia will not deliver Yak-130 fighter planes to Syria while the situation there remains
  "unresolved", the country's service for military cooperation said on Monday, according to the RIA news agency.

     "In the current situation talking about deliveries of airplanes to Syria is premature," Vyacheslav Dzirkaln,
  deputy director of the service, told journalists at the Farnborough Airshow, RIA said.

     Russia reportedly signed an order to deliver 40 fighter-trainer jets at the end of last year, despite controversy
  surrounding its arms sales to violence-torn Syria.
