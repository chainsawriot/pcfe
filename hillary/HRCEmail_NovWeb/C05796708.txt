Madam Secretary/Hillary,
                                                                    In spite of all of the tumult in the Middle East, you
have led our support for democratic change. Just as our fledgling democracy took many years to form, the new and free
countries will take time to create their democracies. But, in the end, I truly believe you will have led the support for
women's voices, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist and even Jewish voices, LGBT voices and young voices to be heard.

Best wishes,
Wendy
