I had breakfast with Cherie Blair who is in town to be sworn into the DC Bar this afternoon as a foreign solicitor! Also, as
you know, she's the co-chair of your International Women Business Leaders Council (with Indra Nooyi). It has been doing
fabulous cutting age work in the areas of access to credit, markets and leadership and has a global network now of many
more leaders. We are trying to schedule the final meeting under your chairmanship,                                                B5
