Damascus rejects UN chief call for unilateral ceasefire
October 10, 2012
AJE

Damascus on Wednesday rejected a call by UN chief Ban Ki-moon for it to declare a unilateral ceasefire, insisting that
rebels fighting the government must stop the violence first.

"We told Ban Ki-moon to send emissaries to the countries which have influence on the armed groups, so that they put
an end to the violence," foreign ministry spokesman Jihad Maqdisi said.
