      The Foreign Service Institute and Under
    Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy and
    Human Rights Maria Otero ANNOUNCE Civilian
             Security Traclecraft (RS600)
 WHAT? A three-day course providing an understanding of civilian security, why it matters, and
          its role in promoting U.S. foreign policy and national security. It is primarily a practical
          course that teaches the tools, resources, and partnerships available to enhance civilian
          security in the field and in Washington, from within our government and beyond.

 WHEN? Wednesday- Friday, October 24-26, 2012, from 8:30 am — 5:00 pm

 WHERE? The George P. Shultz National Foreign Affairs Training Center, (SA-42), 4000 Arlington

 WHY?       In creating the new Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy and Human
             Rights, the QDDR emphasized the importance of human security to our national
             security — preventing and responding to crisis and conflict, securing democracy, and
             advancing human rights. This course will help officers develop the tools to support a
             coherent capacity to promote stability and security in conflicted and fragile states,
             support and develop democratic practices globally and advance human rights and
             humanitarian policies and programming.

 HOW?        Please enroll by October 17, 2012. Department of State employees, click here, to
