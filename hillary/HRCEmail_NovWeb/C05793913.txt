Cheryl -

I thought of you last night when I was listening to our President. He is so damn good - truly the best. I'll always
be so proud to have served in the Clinton Administration. What an amazing speech by an amazing man.

You may be in Asia right now or keeping the home fires burning. Either way, I was thinking of you when I
watched his speech. I even let                 watch a little (the time difference was in our favor).

xxoo,
Ann
