Subject:                           Thank You



Madam Secretary,

I just wanted to keep you updated on my job prospects. I've had several good conversations with Rich Verma over the
course of the last several days, and I'm very excited to be joining his team next week.

I can't thank you enough for all of your support and help during this process. It's been invaluable, and I am incredibly
grateful. I'm really looking forward to the new challenge and of course rejoining the team.

And I would be remiss if I didn't also single out Cheryl, Laura Pena, Heather Samuelson, and Pat Carter (from HR), each of
whom has been tremendously patient and helpful during this process as well.

Thank you again.
