Jake,

Susan saw HBJ yesterday and was to see Attiyah today. We have her HBJ read-out (with thanks to Robert for getting it to
me) and will get you the one from today when we have it.
                                                                                                                1.4(B)
                                                                                                                1.4(E)
From Susan Ziadeh:
                                                                                                                B1
Had a short conversation with PM/FM Hamed bin Jassim on margins of Energy DepSec Poneman meeting with him this
afternoon.




I see Khalid AI-Atiyah tomorrow (he just returned today) and will follow up in more detail. You may have seen by now in
today's NYT article (by Robert Worth, dateline Riyadh) and Khalid AI-Atiyah's quote below.




                                                                                                                   1.4(B)
More tomorrow and will report front channel. Best, Susan                                                           1.4(E)
                                                                                                                   B1
Article Susan refers to:

"You can give the rebels AKs, but you can't stop the Syrian regime's military with AKs," said Khalid al-Attiyah, a state
minister for foreign affairs in Qatar. Providing the rebels with heavier weapons "has to happen," he added. "But first we
need the backing of the United States, and preferably the UN"
