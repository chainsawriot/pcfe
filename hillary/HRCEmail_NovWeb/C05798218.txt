Subject: CORRECTION: Israel informed U.S. of planned air strike in Syria, American official tells the New York Times
(Haaretz)

Corrected for incomplete sentence in paragraph four.
(Haaretz) - A number of sources from within Syria and outside its borders claimed Israel had launched two
airstrikes in Syria; Israel hadn't confirmed or denied the reports.
Israel informed the United States of its plans to attack a military target inside Syria prior to launching an
airstrike on a military research center outside Damascus, a U.S. official speaking on condition of anonymity
told the New York Times late on Wednesday.
In addition to the strike on the research center, Israeli warplanes bombed a convoy near Syria's border with
Lebanon, sources told Reuters, apparently targeting weapons destined for Hezbollah in what some called a
warning to Damascus not to arm the Lebanese faction.
Syrian state television confirmed the reports that Israel had bombed a military research center at Jamraya,
between Damascus and the nearby border, but Syrian rebels disputed that, saying their forces had attacked the
site. No source spoke of a second Israeli strike.
With official secrecy shrouding the event, few details were corroborated by multiple sources. All those with
knowledge of the events - from several countries - spoke anonymously.
