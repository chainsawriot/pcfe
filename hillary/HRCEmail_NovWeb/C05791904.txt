Subject: Yemeni minister survives assassination attempt (Reuters)

ADEN (Reuters) - Yemen's Transport Minister Waed Abdullah Bathib survived an assassination attempt on
Saturday when shots were fired at his car, a local government official said.

   Nobody was hurt in the attack in the southern city of Aden, but Bathib's car was pockmarked by bullets, the
official told Reuters.

  He said that the shots were fired from another car. It was not clear who was behind the attack in the
Khormaksar district of the city or how many gunmen were involved.

  Bathib is a member of the Yemen Socialist Party, the former ruling party of South Yemen, of which Aden
was the capital, before its unification with the north in 1990.
