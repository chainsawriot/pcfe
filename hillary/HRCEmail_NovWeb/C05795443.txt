Yes.                           One or both lived there earlier in their service.                                           B6

They gave you a book of Burmese fables, and an iPad with some movies (which we thanked them for profusely, but
didn't take with us). Along with Burmese "good luck" owls

The two book titles you confirmed for Monica are very helpful, thank you. That should satisfy Steve's thirst for color.

Do you remember the story of how those books were delivered in the middle of the night by 2 FSOs (married) on our
way back from Indonesia?

Philippe is looking for a list of books that you read for your Burma trip for the Steve Myers story, which has a lot on
Burma.

We found two in your office. Can we share these with Philippe? Are there any other books you'd like us to add? He's fine
with one book but will take as many as he can get.



1.      Burma/Myanmar: What Everyone Needs to Know, by David Steinberg, 2010.
