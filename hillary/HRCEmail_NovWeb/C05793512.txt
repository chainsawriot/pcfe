Madame Secretary,

I wanted to send you a short note about today's release of the new Global Burden of Disease study and how it relates to
cookstoves. The study estimates that 4 million people die each year from exposure to cookstove smoke â€” that's twice as
many people as we thought (2 million). The study now ranks this as the 4th worst health risk factor in the world (we used
to say it was 5th worst in developing countries), after only high blood pressure, smoking, and alcohol use. And it is the
2nd worst health risk factor in the world for women and girls, after only high blood pressure. Exposure to cookstove
smoke is the single worst health risk factor in South Asia for both sexes, and the 2nd worst health risk factor in Sub-
Saharan Africa (though first for women in most parts of SSA). This 4 million figure is more than the study attributes to
HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria combined.

But the most shocking statistic of all is that only a handful of people are working full-time to solve this severe risk
factor: 15 staff at the Alliance, Jacob and a few other U.S. federal employees, a few staff in different U.N. agencies, a
handful of bilaterally-funded efforts, and scattered researchers, businesses and NG0s.

Thank you for your leadership on this issue to bring the Alliance where it is today. Today, we know better than ever
before that our efforts have been well directed.

I hope you are feeling better.

Best,
Kris
