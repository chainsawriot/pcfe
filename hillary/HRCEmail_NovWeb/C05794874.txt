Dear Melanne:
As you know, President Sirleaf and Sec. Clinton are meeting on Friday morning of this
week.

A key point which Ellen will propose is the creation of a US-Liberian Bi-national
Commission to institutionalize the gains in Liberia and ensure that the partnership
endures well beyond the present administrations in the US and in Liberia. Such a
proposal would allow the priorities (from AFRICOM to food security, MCC) to be
categorized, charted, reported on and measured for success.

The Commission would oblige regular meetings and require constant high-level US
engagement. Other areas of common concern and shared responsibility such as
governance, energy, regional security could be incorporated into such a framework.

The US-Nigerian Bi-national Commission inaugurated in 2010 by Sec. Clinton is a
model for consideration.

Given the anticipated departure of Sec. Clinton from the State department, regardless
of the outcome of the US election in November, we would trust she would be
supportive of such a superstructure to preserve and protect Liberia's future.

The second point, I want to signal is that Ellen would like a few minutes alone with
Hillary at the meeting.

Many thanks,
Debbie
