Dear Cheryl:

We in London are extremely excited for Secretary Clinton's visit. Hopefully if you join her we will have a few minutes to
get together. The purpose of this e-mail is to bring you up to date on my decision regarding the potential employment
of                  as my Schedule C assistant. I met two times with              and the meetings confirmed eve thin
you said as to her capabilities, intelligence and personality. My conclusion at the end of the meetings was that
was so overqualified for the position we need to fill. It would be like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole and it
would end up not working out for either of us. Our needs are 80% administrative, evidenced by our position description
which is attached.

I believe that           inderstood my difficulties in attempting to have a Special Assistant with her skills. That being said,
I definitely want to use her capabilities and create a relationship not only personally, but with the Embassy in the
future. I have appointed her to                                           â– which she was very excited about. I am in the
process of looking for special projects in the Embassy and to make introductions to major corporations who may be able
to use her skills in the private sector. I am attaching her e-mail to me, which speaks for itself.

A Schedule C assistant is needed and very important here in Embassy London. I will be forwarding on to Heather
Samuelson two additional resumes of candidates we are now interviewing.

I will keep you posted on how we are doing.

Regards,
Louis
