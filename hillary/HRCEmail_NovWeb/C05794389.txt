Subject: US Water Partnership. ..Won't get in the way and may be able to help

H,
May I have your permission to speak with someone on your staff regarding this new Water Partnership ? If yes, who
would that be ? I have been in the trenches on this topic in the US, and to some degree in the UK and elsewhere, for
over 4 years and have learned a great deal about specific vulnerabilities, possible better and less costly systems, pitfalls,
barriers, etc. Includes many US cities, some water authorities, some water associations, etc. Would love to 'noodle'
and strategize this with the right person. Won't get in the way, may be able to help & will be low profile. As
always, thanks. M
