Subject: S(67) has made her Final Departure from the building



Our beloved 67th Secretary of State has departed the building for the final time in her tenure. After almost a million
miles, thousands of bilats, meetings and phone calls, hundreds of pre-briefs, camera sprays, press avails, photo ops, pull-
asides, clutches, huddles, and drop-bys, not to mention the scores of interviews and townterviews (I have never liked
that word!) receptions and dinners, HRC's time here at State has come to an end.

Madame Secretary, From my perch just outside your office I have had quite a view of history in the making and it has
been a distinct honor and privilege. Your entire State Department family in Washington and at all of our embassies and
consulates around the world have been inspired by your unrelenting passion, dedication, sense of duty and mind
boggling stamina!

You will be missed here at the Ship of State and you will always be remembered with the greatest of respect, admiration
and affection.

Thank you, thank you, thank you for everything you have done for us, for our country and for so many around the world.

As they say in the Navy, we will always have your six and we wish you only Fair Winds and Following Seas!

Get some rest!

Love,
Claire
