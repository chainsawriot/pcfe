Family has asked for there not to be a state funeral. Suggestion is that we send a representative and that our
ambassador might be best choice.

All,

EAP is still waiting on confirmation on whether former Philippines President Aquino's funeral will be a private affair or
whether it will be necessary to send a presidential delegation.

In preparation for a presidential delegation, EAP has recommended the following individuals to serve as delegates.

Let me know if anyone should be added or removed from this list.
