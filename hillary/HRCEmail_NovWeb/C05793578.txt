Subject: An Idea for Three Legacy Speeches


I am very much looking forward to our lunch tomorrow. The attached is a short memo setting forth some of the ideas
that I mentioned briefly when we talked in December; I hope you might have a chance to read it tonight or else I can just
talk you through it tomorrow.
Best,
AM
