Jim and Cheryl

With apologies for taking your time with an obvious point, I want to note important consideration in connection with
Tuesday's announcement of Chris Painter's appointment as the Department's cyber coordinator:

Coordinating the Department's sprawling, evolving interest in cyber matters is going to be extremely difficult under the
best of circumstances. That is so because of both the nature of the subject matter and the nature of the State
Department as an institution.
