I just cannot begin to thank you (I will do so in Haiti though by working hard and making sure progress continues — even
accelerates). S looked — and sounded — fabulous.                                                         STILL talking     B6
about her this morning—they have called the entire church by this time I am sure!!!!

Will be in touch soon — running to airport.

Much love, pam
