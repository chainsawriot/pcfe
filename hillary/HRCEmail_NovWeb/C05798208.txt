Subject: Message for Secretary Clinton: Transmittal Request

Dear Madam Counselor, dear Cheryl,

     Upon the occasion of the Secretary's departure from the Department, may I once again ask you kindly to send the
message below to the Secretary.

       In doing so, I should also like to express my warm appreciation to you for your own personal support of me and
10M on a range of issues, in particular Haiti which I re-visited on the occasion of the third anniversary of the 12 January
2010 earthquake. There, despite the long road ahead, I came away once more inspired by the indomitable spirit of the
Haitian people.

        Thanks again, and my kind regards. Bill



"Dear Madam Secretary,

       As you prepare to conclude your mandate, I would like to express my profound gratitude to you for your
leadership at a critical juncture in our nation's history. You have made all of us in the Foreign Service, past and present,
extremely proud.

      On a parochial note, I should like to thank you for your support of me personally in my capacity as Director General
of the International Organization for Migration (IOM), in particular your endorsement of me for a second term of office
at 10M. I was deeply honored to see you on several occasions during your mandate, e.g., at the Summit of the Americas
in Trinidad and Tobago and, more recently, in Cartagena, Colombia. It was a singular honor and privilege to be asked to
be part of your FAPB Working Group on Benghazi.

       All of us were very concerned for you and your well-being during you recent hospitalization, and, subsequently,
greatly relieved that you were able, soon thereafter, to resume your duties. We are all grateful to you for the invitation
to the Working Luncheon for the FAPB in the Ben Franklin Room on 3 January and very much missed you.

      Congratulations on your tremendous accomplishments over these past years and for all you have done for our
country abroad. We all owe you an enormous debt of gratitude. I join an entire throng of others in wishing you God's
richest blessings for the future.

                              With highest esteem. Bill Swing."
