We need to ck family's druthers. If they are OK, we should put something out from you tonight.

Also, everyone will assume the first statement was about Chris so we need to make clear this is a second death and/or
name both.

Cheryl told me the Libyans confirmed his death. Should we announce tonight or wait until morning?
