Subject: Bissau politician rejects junta job offer (Reuters)

Wanted to make sure you saw this in case it comes up on the call.

BISSAU (Reuters) - The man that Guinea-Bissau's military rulers chose to run a two-year transition back to democracy
has refused the offer, casting further doubt on the junta's internationally criticized roadmap to elections.

  Manuel Sherif Nhamadjo, who lost in a first-round presidential poll in March before a run-off was derailed by the
coup, said late on Friday he would remain in his current post of vice-president of the ruling PAIGC party.

   "I was not consulted by for the post of president of the transition," he said, a day after the junta nominated him to
lead a National Transitional Council charged with organizing elections sometime in 2014.

   The African Union and West African regional bloc ECOWAS have rejected the junta's two-year transition plan and
urged a swift restoration of constitutional order, with ECOWAS calling the move by the junta illegal.

  "The (ECOWAS) Commission wishes to reiterate its rejection of the usurpation of power by the Military Command,
and to make it known that it will never recognize any transitional arrangement emanating from the junta," it said.
