S-19/... The deteriorating situation of human rights in the Syrian Arab Republic, and the
            recent killings in El-Houleh

                The Human Rights Council,
                 Recalling General Assembly resolutions 66/176 of 19 December 2011 and 66/253 of 16
            February 2012, Human Rights Council resolutions S-16/1 of 29 April 2011, 5-17/1 of 22 August
            2011, 5-18/1 of 2 December 2011, 19/1 of 1 March 2012 and 19/22 of 23 March 2012, and
            Security Council resolutions 2042 (2012) of 14 April 2012 and 2043 (2012) of 21 April 2012,

                Condemning the killings, confirmed by United Nations observers, of dozens of men, women
            and children and the wounding of hundreds more in the village of El-Houleh, near Homs, in
            attacks that involved the wanton killing of civilians by shooting at close range and by severe
            physical abuse by pro-regime elements and a series of Government artillery and tank shellings
            of a residential neighbourhood; and reiterating that all violence in all its forms by all parties must
            cease,

                     Recalling that the statement made by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on 27
             May 2012 that the atrocities in El-Houleh may amount to crimes against humanity and noting
             her repeated encouragement to the Security Council to refer the situation in Syria to the
             International Criminal Court,

            Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial
             integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic and to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations,

                 1.        Condemns in the strongest possible terms such an outrageous use of force against
             the civilian population, which constitutes a violation of applicable international law and of the
             commitment of the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic, under Security Council resolutions
             2042 (2012) and 2043 (2012), to cease violence in all its forms, including the cessation of the
             use of heavy weapons in population centres;

                    2.      Condemns in the harshest terms the outrageous killing of forty-nine children, all
             under the age of 10;

                    3.      Deplores that the recent killings in El-Houleh occurred in a context of continued
             human rights violations in the Syrian Arab Republic, including ongoing arbitrary detentions,
             hindered access for the media and restrictions of the right to peaceful assembly;

               4.        Emphasizes the continued failure of the Syrian authorities to protect and promote
           the rights of all Syrians, including through repeated and systematic violations of human rights;

               5.      Reiterates its urgent call upon the Syrian authorities to put an immediate end to all
           violence and all human rights violations, and to meet their responsibility to protect their
           populations;
               6.        Calls once again upon the Syrian authorities to immediately allow United Nations
           human rights mechanisms and missions full and unfettered access and freedom of movement
           within the Syrian Arab Republic;
               7.       Stresses the need to conduct an international, transparent, independent and prompt
            investigation into violations of international law with a view to hold to account those responsible
            for widespread, systematic and gross human rights violations, including those violations that
            may amount to crimes against humanity;

                  8.            Requests the commission of inquiry to urgently conduct a comprehensive,
            independent and unfettered special inquiry, consistent with international standards, into the
            events in El-Houleh, and if possible to publicly identify those who appear responsible for these
            atrocities, and to preserve the evidence of crimes for possible future criminal prosecutions or a
            future justice process, with a view to hold to account those responsible; and also requests the
            commission to provide a full report of the findings of its special inquiry to the Human Rights
            Council at its twentieth session;
                9.       Calls upon the Syrian authorities to cooperate fully with the commission of inquiry
            and to accord it full and unfettered access to the Syrian Arab Republic to conduct its work;

                 10.        Calls upon all States Members of the United Nations to assist the commission of
            inquiry in its mission by providing the support necessary for it to achieve its objectives, including,
            but not limited to, Member States calling upon the Syrian authorities to grant the commission
            the access required to conduct its work;
               11.      Calls upon the Syrian authorities to grant immediate, unimpeded and full access of
            humanitarian organizations to all areas of the Syrian Arab Republic in order to allow them to
            provide relief and humanitarian assistance, and calls on all sides to respect the safety of
            humanitarian workers;
                12.     Requests the cooperation, as appropriate, of other relevant United Nations bodies
            with the commission of inquiry to carry out its mission, and requests the assistance of the United
            Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Secretary-General in this regard;

                 13.Calls for the urgent, comprehensive and immediate implementation of all elements of
            the Joint Special Envoy of the United Nations and the League of Arab States six-point proposal
            as annexed to Security Council resolution 2042 without any preconditions;
                  13. Invites the Joint Special Envoy for the United Nations and the League of Arab States,
            Kofi Annan, to provide a briefing to the Human Rights Council at its twentieth session;

                14.      Decides to remain seized of the matter.
