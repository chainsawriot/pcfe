MS, I will join the chorus tonight and tell you what an amazing job you did today. Simply amazing.

At the hearing tomorrow, Menendez will give a short introduction followed by Corker. You will be the first official
introduction at the table with Kerry. McCain and Warren will take your seat for their respective introductions after you
depart. I wanted to mention Corker since I just became aware he would be between Menendez and your remarks.

Secondly, the 100K Strong event — this is the Asia 100K Strong. When we did the launch two years ago, it became an
official State initiative. Tomorrow is the celebration of the launch as a non-profit, independent entity.
I connected with Kathleen Kennedy Townsend and while they are close, they haven't reached the level of donations yet to
launch 100K Strong Latin America. She and I have a call set up in the morning to see how close they are in terms of an
event. My apologies for the miscommunication — we will have you in and out at the event tomorrow.

Thank you — Lona
