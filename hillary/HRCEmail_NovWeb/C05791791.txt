This is a guy I went to Oxford with - he's now running the major think tank in Australia. Thought you would appreciate
the punch line of this chain.

Michael — huge congrats. That's really incredible.

Let's stay in touch as the date approaches ... we'll definitely think of you as we plan our engagements in Perth, including
the possibility of a speech.

Jake — big news (for me, in any case). I've been appointed Executive Director of the Lowy Institute, the Brookings/CFR of
Australia: http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/lowy-institute-boss-steps-down/story-fn3dxiwe-
1226452573608

I wanted to say to you that if there's anything we can do to assist with the Secretary's planned visit to Perth in
November for AUSMIN, I hope you'll think of us. In particular, if she wanted to give a speech and you were looking for a
host or co-host, please get in contact.

Hope all is well with you.

Best wishes,
Michael

    . It was the release of this video that brought on this crisis: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOUFKZBpFTY

      It's always interesting in Australian politics.

      Cheers,
