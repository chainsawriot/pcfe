I think it would be good if you would, There are so many challenges in Afg but one of the most critical needs is for a
justice system that works and begins to address impunity, and especially the violence vs women. Lal Bibi is very brave to
have spoken out.
 We have found in the setting up of violence against women units by INL, for example, women have begun to come out
in the few places they exist to make known the attacks on them. INL has sponsored awareness campaigns about the
units and the response has doubled in a short time. I understand that there have even been some successful
prosecutions at the local level. This is an area of tremendous need. Also Afgh has a law to eliminate violence vs women
that has been implemented and enforced minimally and we've been working to address that. Our training is supposed to
include a component on the protection of women against abuse. I don't know if we were involved in the training in this
case or not but it points to the need for this kind of education.

At any rate,her courage is extraordinary and if you were to make a statement condemning what happened I think it
would be a strong message --- particularly in this time of transition and the ongoing need to address impunity.

The countries where you're traveling have been leaders in addressing sexual violence in conflict and Sweden has a
Nordic Centre for Gender in Military Operations which they've just made available to NATO.

I want to speak out about this which I hope might protect her and prod the govt to act. Also if the attackers were
American backed, we have an obligation.
