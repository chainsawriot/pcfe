Subject: Hague Call Tomorrow Morning
Importance: High

The Secretary is talking with British FM Hague tomorrow morning, a call that puts them squarely in the middle of the
Schumer et al demand for a review of the medical information that Scottish authorities used to release Megrahi and
their demand for an investigation of BP's lobbying of the UK government. Now, in today's briefing, I acknowledged BP's
public statement today that they did lobby the UK government on the prisoner exchange agreement that preceded
Megrahi's release and tried to acknowledge that there was the separation of more than a year between the agreement
and Megrahi and I mentioned that the UK government insisted to us that the two were not linked. I tried to establish a
public basis for us to potentially conclude and report back to the senators that there is nothing to investigate. That said, I
think it is important that the Secretary mention to Hague that this issue has popped up in our political space and that we
are dealing with it. Hague needs to know that we will be dealing with this issue for weeks as we approach the
anniversary of the Megrahi release. If the Secretary doesn't mention this tomorrow, we will give the senators another
opportunity to write us and it makes it even more likely the issue will be forced onto



PJ
