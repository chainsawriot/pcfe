Subject: Syrian amb to Iraq defects

Al-Jazirah is reporting now that the Syrian amb to Iraq has defected.

We had heard that he was very unhappy.

Assuming the story is true, he is the first senior diplomat from the regime to defect. (There was an honorary
consul and a former ambassador, but now sitting amb.) Other prominent civilians to defect include a deputy
oil minister and a senior inspector general.

Hope the amb got his family out of Syria â€”they'll be dead if he didn't.
