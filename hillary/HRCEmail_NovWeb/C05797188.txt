Madam Secretary,
If a call on Algeria/Mali still helpful, wanted to let you know I will be away from secure phone from about 6pm-9pm
tonight. Tomorrow I will be by secure phone in morning, will go to Diplomatic lunch at midday and back to a secure
phone somewhere between 2-3 tomorrow afternoon. Can also catch up on Tuesday as well. Almost impossible to
believe only two more weeks-- somewhat unimaginable... Thank you.
Wendy
