Subject: Any other speech ideas?

As you know, I'm concerned about this event tomorrow but not sure there's anything I could say in the speech that
would assuage that.

Also, I know the original idea was Podesta's, but I don't see how I can deliver a progressive economic speech in Denmark
that wouldn't be viewed as either political vis a vis the election or intrusive into the eurozone deliberations.

So, there's not much to say unless you have other ideas.
