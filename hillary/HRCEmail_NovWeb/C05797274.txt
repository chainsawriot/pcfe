Embassy Beirut Reporting- October 21, 2012

EI (SBU) March 8:                                                                             Mikati did not formally     1 .4(B)
submit his resignation to President Michel Sleiman, but indicated to the President his willingness to do so. He withheld 1 .4(D)
his resignation per Sleiman's request that he not create a security vacuum by resigning abruptly, but he still intends to B1
resign. Mikati will travel to Mecca on Tuesday, October 23 to participate in the Hajj; in the meantime, Sleiman and
Progressive Socialist Party head Walid Jumblatt (often referred to as Lebanon's "kingmaker," as he has been known to
switch sides) will lead efforts to identify a solution; Jumblatt reportedly strongly opposes Mikati's abrupt
resignation. Hizballah also reportedly opposes Mikati's resignation and is said to have opposed efforts (reportedly
supported by Sleiman and Mikati) to refer the murder of Wissam al-Hassan to the Special Tribunal for Lebanon for
investigation.


lB (SBU) March 14: Several March 14 leaders continued to issue statements blaming Syria for the murder of Wissam al-
Hassan and demanding Mikati's immediate resignation during the morning of October 21.                                        1 .4(D)

0 (SBU) Funeral Procession: Hassan's funeral will reportedly commence at 14:00 local today in central Beirut. A contact
said that Hassan's body would be transported in an open military vehicle from the ISF Headquarters in the Syriac
Quarter to Martyrs' Square in downtown Beirut, a distance of approximately two kilometers. Nearly all roads in
downtown Beirut have been closed. Press reports indicated that Participants were already beginning to travel to the
funeral from locations in the north and the Bekaa. Contacts in the Internal Security Forces (ISF) expected participants to
begin arriving in large numbers at 11:00, and predicted total participation would exceed 100,000. Our contacts in the
ISF have not indicated whether they expect the gathering to be violent, but they have planned and staged resources to
address a non-peaceful demonstration, including the deployment of 3,000 ISF forces in addition to a significant number
of forces from Lebanese Armed Forces. Local staff recall that the funeral procession of Rafik Hariri in 2005 was chaotic,
but did not lead to significant violence.



lB (SBU) Other Security: Additional security incidents were reported overnight, including road closures and armed
 clashes between the Sunni and Alawite neighborhoods of Bab El Tebbeneh and Jabal Mohsen in Tripoli. No incidents
 were reported in the vicinity of the Embassy, and all mission staff remain accounted for. All non-official moves off the
