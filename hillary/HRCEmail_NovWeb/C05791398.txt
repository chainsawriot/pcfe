Madam Secretary,
Cheryl and Bill know that I will be
              if there is need for me to return early, I can do so. I will have cell and secure cell with me. I learned long
ago that no one is indispensible, but that being said, Bill knows to call if circumstances change and I need to be in DC or
elsewhere. The weight of the world is particularly heavy at the moment.
Wendy
