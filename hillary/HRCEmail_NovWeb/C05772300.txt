Madam Secretary,




I actually was thinking about coming up to see you to update you on progress at the Bureau and just to catch up in
general. I'll work with Lona/Eric to find a time.

Also, I'm really pleased that you agreed with the choice of my Principal Deputy, Tom Countryman to be Assistant
Secretary for ISN. He's been invaluable in helping to rebuild PM and while he will be difficult to replace in PM, I think
he's the perfect choice for ISN.

Will look for a window to see you soon.

Andrew
