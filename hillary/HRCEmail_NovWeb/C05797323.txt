Subject:                            thanks so much for calling



I really do look forward to a long conversation                          when you are out of office and can get some real
downtime. Meantime, I just have to say.that one of Obama's best moments in the debate tonight (more about domestic
policy, and certainly the electoral map, than foreign policy) was at the end when he said "I will listen to your voices; I will
fight for you." A leaf directly out of your 2008 playbook; I got a lump in my throat.
Best,
AM
