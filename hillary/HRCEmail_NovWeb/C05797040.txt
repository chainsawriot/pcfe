Hillary:

Just wanted to let you know that you have been in my thoughts and prayers ever since I first heard about your
concussion. I hope you make a full and speedy recovery.


I also hope you will take the advice you gave me and take some time to rest and recuperate from this intense period of
public service.

Once you recover, I would love to have another lunch to catch up and compare notes on life post-government.


In the meantime, wishing you and your family all the best for the new year.

Best,
Michele
