Oscar is printing 3 call sheets for you.

1. Ivoirian President Ouattara -- AF and P would like you to make this call today and Jake endorses. There is also a
confidential IM on the situation in Mali that they would like you to read which we will send to you if you'd like to make
the call today. Let us know.

2. Ethiopian PM Meles -- you mentioned that you would like to see the call sheet before deciding to make the call.

3. Ugandan President Museveni -- you mentioned that you would like to see the call sheet before deciding to make the
call.

4. Per AF's recommendation, Jake says we can stand down on the call to Mashebane.
