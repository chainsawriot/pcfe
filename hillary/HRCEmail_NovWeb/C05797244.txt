        Why does Hillary Clinton appear so capable at Senate hearing? Because she knows her brief and the
        issues better than anyone in the room.

   1. Daniel Drearier Pdandrezner


        Conspiracy-mongers are gonna go nuts after Clinton's testimony today. For someone with serious health
        scares last month, she looks fabulous.

   1. Philip Klein Pphilipaklein


        Shorter Hillary Clinton: "You can't handle the truth!"

   1.   Market Bull PMarket Bull


        Nobody puts Hillary in a corner.

        Hillary Clinton is doing magnificently in the Benghazi hearing. Strong, clear, focused on solutions. She
        will be missed.

        Toughest exchange in hearing w/ Wisconson GOP Sen Johnson over talking pts Clinton not taking any
        guff from these guys #mitcheillreroorts

        Subtext of Clinton shouting at Sen. Johnson: There's nothing you can do to me now, so I'm not taking
        any more of your shit.

    1. Josh Rogin pioshrogin


        "What difference at this point does it make?!" whether there was a protest. Clinton yells at Ron
        Johnson. Damn.

    1. Laura Sea)/ (atexasinafrica


           I'm a little in awe.
