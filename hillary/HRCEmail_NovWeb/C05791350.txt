POLITICO Breaking News

In a shakeup of Washington's public-affairs elite, Donald A. Baer, White House communications director under
President Bill Clinton and a longtime media executive, on Thursday was named global chief executive officer
of Burson-Marsteller -- the top job at the public-relations giant. Baer succeeds Mark Penn, who is joining
Microsoft Corp. as corporate vice president, strategic and special projects, according to the Burson-Marsteller
announcement. Penn, senior strategist for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, has Microsoft among his
many top corporate clients, and has been an adviser to chairman Bill Gates. Baer joined Burson-Marsteller four
years ago and has been a worldwide vice chairman and the chief strategy officer. Baer has also been serving as
chairman of Burson-Marsteller's sister research firm, Penn Schoen Berland, and will continue in that role.
