Hi Cheryl,

Thank you very much for inviting me to meet with you today. I am very energized by the idea of coming back
to State to work on an issue that matters so much. I wanted to let you know that I was able to have good
conversations today with Elissa Slatkin, Bill Burns, Tom Nides, Pat Kennedy, Jeff Feltman and Michael Corbin.

All the best,
