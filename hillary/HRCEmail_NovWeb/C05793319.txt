And, you were "present at the creation"!

Happy New Year to you and your family. I loved seeing you at the Board meeting, but we didn't have time to talk. So I
hope you'll give me notice when you'll next be in DC so we can have dinner or at least a visit.

Until then, may 2012 be a year of blessings and fulfillment for you and yours. All the best, H

Seeing Maria up there articulating the J vision and reading the coverage re focusing on civilian security (Josh Rogin wrote
that it better allows the US to protect individuals around the world and engage civil society) is the best possible reward.
You are shaping a tremendous legacy.
Happy New Year!
