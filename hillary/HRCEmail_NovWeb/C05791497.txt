               2         conflict resolution, lasting stability, and inclusive
               3         democratic governance.
               4              (3) The meaningful inclusion of women in the
               5         prevention and resolution of conflicts also requires
               6         engaging men and boys in the effort to empower

               8         versal benefits of gender equality.
               9              (4) During the second half of the 20th century,
              10         appmflmateuy 25 percent of conflicts that had ended
              11         in a peace agreement resumed within 5 years, and
              12         nearly 50 percent of the conflicts resolved by an ac
              13         cord during the 1990s resumed within 5 years.
              14              (5) Since 1992, women have accounted for
              15         fewer than 3 percent of mediators and 8 percent of
              16         negotiators in major peace processes.
              17              (6) Successful peace negotiations that produce
              18         just and sustainable peace agreements generally in-
              19         elude robust mechanisms for the participation of

              21              (7) From Guatemala to Darfur to Northern
              22         Ireland, women have made major contributions to
              23         peace negotiations, helping to ensure that processes

               5         tries are more peaceful and prosperous when women
