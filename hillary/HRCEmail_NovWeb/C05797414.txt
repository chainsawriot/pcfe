Subject: Sec. Clinton

Tamera - - I would be very grateful if you could pass on the following message to Sec. Clinton:

Dear Secretary Clinton,

Phyllis and I have been very concerned since learning of your fall and concussion several weeks ago, and are now more
acutely alarmed over your hospitalization for a blood clot.

Please know that we are thinking of you and that you are in our prayers - - and praying is one thing that I am pretty good
at!

Most sincerely, we wish you a full and speedy recovery and hope you are able to return to your regular routine in short
order.

Please accept our best wishes for a 2013 filled with good health, joy, success and peace.

Warm regards and Shalom,

Michael
