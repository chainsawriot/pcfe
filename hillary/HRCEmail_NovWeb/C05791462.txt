RE: INCOMING EGYPTIAN CABINET

On Thursday, the names of almost all of the ministers in Egyptian PM Qandil's cabinet are
scheduled to be announced, according to state-run newspaper al-Ahram and other Egyptian
news sources. Some minister-designates have already made public statements, and an Egypt
news site has published a notional list, missing key ministries such as Justice, Health and
Culture.

With the huge caveat that all of this is subject to change until it is announced, below please find
a few preliminary impressions on the new Cabinet.

   • Dominated by technocrats. So far we know of only 2-3 FJP cabinet members and one
     from a moderate Islamist party, al-Wasat. There appear to be no non-Islamist politicians
     and no Salafists. This tracks with PM Qandil's statements that merit—not politics—
     would decide the Cabinet. Some have speculated that the remaining cabinet posts and
     especially the presidential advisor positions will feature more FJP members as well as
     more women and Christians.



   • Continuity in key positions. Foreign Minister Amr and Finance Minister al-Saeed will
     most likely stay on, along with at least three other ministers from the current Ganzouri
     cabinet. Defense Minister Tantawi is expected to stay as well. The picture at the Justice
     Ministry is less clear, with credible reports that two prominent judicial reformers have
     rejected offers alongside those that the current minister will stay.

• Few women and Christians. The names mentioned for upwards of twenty cabinet
  positions include two women, both holdovers from the Ganzouri cabinet. A highly
  unscientific survey of the names suggests one Christian, Science Minister Nadia Zakhary,
  though there may be others.



• New Minister of Interior from Old Guard. Major General Ahmed Gamal-eddin, a
  career policeman and current Assistant Interior Minister for General Security, will
  reportedly be promoted to Interior Minister. According to
          he has been working on Sinai security issues in his current post.



• Ministry of International Cooperation's Future in Question. Among the posts not
  listed is Minister for International Cooperation (MIC), a post which Fayza Aboul-Naga
  has said she will not hold in the new government. Embassy Cairo reports strong
  indications that the MIC will merge into the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the new
  Cabinet.
