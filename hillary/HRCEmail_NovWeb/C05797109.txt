Here's latest. Probably best to book him next time, given constraints.

Jake: got your message, but for some reason I'm having trouble responding with hotmail (maybe the 1990s have truly
ended).

I am in a meeting with Ban and Muallem at 9:30. I can't miss that. And I'm chairing a meeting with agency heads on the
Sahel at 11. So I don't think I'm available just before or after the small state thing (which I'm not attending).

One option would be 8:30 at the Waldorf -- if S is up and available. I'd have to leave by 9:00 to brief the SG on Syria just
before the Muallem meeting. And I'd have to cancel Esther Brimmer, who asked to see me at 8:30! (I don't mind
cancelling Esther.). Would 8:30 at the Waldorf work?
