Subject: CGI Announcement on Scaling Up Nutrition in Guatemala

Cheryl/Jake-

I thought you would be interested in the upcoming CGI announcement of an initiative to reduce child malnutrition in
Guatemala. The initiative was inspired by Hillary's "1000 Days Movement" that was launched with the Irish Government
at the UNGA meetings in September 2010. Guatemala suffers from the highest rate of child malnutrition in Latin
America, with an estimated 49.8% of children under five chronically malnourished. It ranks third in the world in
prevalence of stunting (after Afghanistan and Yemen). The initiative is focused on implementing the specific 13
interventions designed to address malnutrition during the critical 1000 days between pregnancy and 2 years of age. I
have been working with Rick Leach/WFP USA to develop the initiative in collaboration with the Guatemalan Government
(I serve on the board/executive committee of WFP USA). In a recent meeting with President Perez, he stated that this
initiative was one of his top priorities and committed significant resources to the effort. It is likely that the
announcement at CGI will include President Clinton, President Perez, private sector leaders from Guatemala and,
possibly, Cargill. It is an exciting initiative â€“ due to the leadership and inspiration provided by Hillary.
