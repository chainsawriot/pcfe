Talked separately this morning to EU, Ger, Fr and UK pol dirs. Cooper (EU) said Ashton's office is following up via Iranian
amb in Brussels to reiterate willingness to meet in late Oct/Nov.

All generally satisfied with last week's E3+1 deputy-level prep discussions. We agreed to do Pol Dir call at E3+1 at end of
this week. I will be in touch with Ryabkov again in meantime.

Spoke to my counterpart. He was appreciative on all counts. I undescored that DC was purely personal and one off.

He recalled the offer made to meet at FM level with P5+1 in NY during UNGA and noted we countered with Ashton but
time ran out. He asked what level we were prepared to meet at 5+1. I said discuss with Ashton but noted in past had been
pol dirs. He was fine with that and thanked me for all above.

Team,

I've spoken with Susan and Bill. Here's where we are:




So only outstanding question is whether others would like us to present the first item in the package for Tom or leave it
out.

Thanks.
