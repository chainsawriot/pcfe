Subject: Re: Judeh's Readout

It is not very good. It blames Israel for the stopping of the negs b/c of continuation of its settlement policy. Reaffirms that
resumption of direct negs requires a 'complete stop to settlements' incl Jerusalem and supports Abbas' position calling for
'a complete stop to all settlement activity in order to permit the resumption of negs.'

2nd para praises Potus UNGA speech, confirms readiness to cooperate fully with US to translate speech to reality, calls
on US to recog Pal state on 67 lines with E Jerusalem as its capital, and asks the US to continue its efforts to create the
approp conditions to resume peace efforts on a sound basis and principally a stop to settlements.

Will do p 2 in sep email

Zaki just texted me that the committee gave one more month to review options. And Judeh texted that the 'good' part of
the communique for us to build on and react to is in its 2nd para.

He'll send me an email and will call the Senator later this evening.

He described the evening as unpleasant, but Abbas did what NJ told the Senator he would do, viz emphasized he was
and wanted to remain engaged with us in efforts to preserve the direct talks based on a moratorium, but outlined the
options as described to us for consideration if talks do not continue. There was an effort to include those options in the
communique, but that was blocked by our friends. Judeh says key pt in stmt is support continued US led discussion with
all parties to create conditions conducive to continued negs.

We should get text before reacting - do any press contacts have it? - and if Judeh is accurate, focus on that line and affirm
we continue our efforts.

I've been in sms commo with Judeh, who says forget the headlines not so bad and will call in 10, and Zaki, who is less
responsive.

Let's not react till we know what we are reacting to.

Otte has similarly recommended Eu hold reaction.

Hi Everyone â€”

Do we know if there is anything to this report? We established that a lot would be said throughout the weekend, but
reports like this are difficult to side-step. Are we still waiting until meetings end tomorrow?

Thanks,
Ambrose

Subject: (Reuters) Arab League endorses Palestinian decision to stop talks

SIRTE (Reuters) - An Arab League committee said on October 8 it endorsed the decision of the Palestinian leadership to
halt talks with Israel over settlement building.

   The committee of Arab foreign ministers, which handles issues related to the peace process, also expressed hope that
the United States will keep up pressure on Israel to halt settlement building, the group's chairman told reporters.
