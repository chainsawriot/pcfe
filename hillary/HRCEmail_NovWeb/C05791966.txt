Subject: FW: Note to Father Gudziak

Melanne and Robert: I delivered the Secretary's letter to Father (now Bishop) Gudziak at the luncheon banquet
yesterday in Lviv, immediately following his three hour (yes three hour) installation as Bishop in a sweltering St. George's
cathedral.

As soon as he saw it Father Borys asked if I would read the letter in front of the 500 or so guests, which included his
mother, brother and many family members.

Melanne: I extended congratulations to Father Borys from you, Mariella, me and the many other friends he had in the
USG. I then said I had received a letter from another admirer, which I proceeded to read without initially identifying the
author. When I got to the end and read, "With blessings and warm regards, I am, Hillary Rodham Clinton" the place
exploded in applause.

Father Borys asked me to extend to the Secretary his deep appreciation for remembering him on this special day. Many
members of Father Borys' family and his friends, came up to me after the banquet, as well as at the airport this morning,
to thank me for the letter which they thought was tremendous.

So thanks for your help in getting me the letter. Well done Robert. You can tell the Secretary that it had just the kind of
impact we hoped.

Best, John

Mr. Ambassador:

Per Melanne Verveer, I've prepared a congrats note from Secretary Clinton to Father Gudziak. Melanne suggested that you wanted to
hand deliver the note. Once it is signed (most likely tomorrow) to what address shall I send it?

Thanks!
