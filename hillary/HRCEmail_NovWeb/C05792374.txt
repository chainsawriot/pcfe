FYI, media report shots were fired at PM Fayyad's office. Fayyad was not present at the time. Post is looking into the
incident and reports Fayyad believes it was accidental. If there are further details, we will pass them along.

PA police reluctantly confirmed the shooting to RSO. Not clear if it was intentional, accidental discharge, or stray round
from family dispute. No injuries. Still tracking. POL also running to ground.

I just spoke to Fayyad + he said it appears to have been accidental. It wasn't his actual office and he wasn't there at the
time. They're looking into it, and RSO and POL are also getting details.

RAMALLAH (AP) -        A Palestinian government official says shots have been fired at the office of Prime
Minister Salam Fayyad. No one was hurt.
   The official says Fayyad was not in his office at sundown Wednesday when at least one bullet hit a building
in his government compound.
   The official says guards told him they heard several shots being fired in the air. It was not clear whether the
shots were fired by gunmen on foot or in a car. The assailants escaped.
   The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the incident with
reporters.
