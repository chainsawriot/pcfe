  PRESS RELEASE
  ldlib Province Declares a Safe Zone


  Washington DC, July 19 2012. The Syrian Support Group (SSG) announced today that the
  Revolutionary Council and the Military Council of the Free Syrian Army (FSA) of ldlib have
  declared a Safe Zone in the province of Idlib. This marks the first declaration of a safe zone in
  Syria and a major accomplishment by the FSA's ability to protect Syrian citizens.

  Safe Zones are perimeters where all Syrian citizens can live under an umbrella of peace and
  security, regardless of their ethnic background or religion. As the Assad regime begins to
  crumble, the FSA intends to spread Safe Zones to other regions of the country. However, there
  are major challenges that the FSA faces without the full support of the international community.
  SSG calls upon the United States to take leadership and provide direct support to the FSA.
  Together, the FSA and the United States can stand shoulder-to-shoulder to bring down the Assad
  regime and restore peace to the nation and beyond.
