Jake,

Because the US election to the HRC wasn't enough of a concern, we have a new one. Wanted to give you a heads up
that we learned yesterday that the Africa Group has selected a clean slate of candidates for their 5 seats in the 2012
elections: Cote d'Ivoire, Gabon, Ethiopia, Sierra Leone, and Sudan.

We are reaching out to USUN now and will demarche African capitals to try to get them to reverse this
decision. Obviously, putting Sudan forward on a clean slate will be extremely damaging to the reputation of the HRC
and will undermine our successes at that body.

We had success in the past with getting others off the slate (most recently Syria) but, as you'll remember, not without a
heavy lift. 10 is taking the lead on coordinating our efforts to reverse thisâ€” No need of action from you right now but
wanted to make sure you (or S) don't get caught by surprise if you hear about this.

Hope you're well,
Dan
