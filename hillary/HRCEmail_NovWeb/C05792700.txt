I hope you are getting just a tiny break in the South Pacific! I think you are right to be doing the most you can in East Asia
in your remaining time, and a focus on Island states can have big pay-offs in the UN. And honestly, our politics have
been so tarnished over the last four years —from "hope and change" to nothing but money — that I for one am glad to
see you NOT at the convention.

When you do step down, I would love to have dinner and hear your full reactions to my article.                 was fairly
negative, which worried me, and I would truly value your views for so many reasons.

I am getting involved in a major initiative to be launched by the Sloan Foundation around flexibility in the workplace;
we've got all the major players involved from business and the women's activist community, as well as Mike and Debbie
Mullen, who have been champions of this issue from the military side. I want to try to make change happen as well as
writing about it. This is an issue that electrifies young people; it taps into many of the things they think about involving
the quality of life they want, connection, community, a life that has time for reflection and compassion.

Much more to say. But you do us proud!
Best,
AM

Military or President: Who Calls the Shots in Egypt?

The relationship between President Morsi and the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) has always been under
intense scrutiny. Morsi's removal of SCAF's leadership could have represented the beginnings of open conflict between the
Morsi and SCAF, but the actual situation is far more complex.


By H.A. Hellyer for RUSI.org




The last couple of weeks have seen a shift in Egyptian politics. It appeared that the Egyptian President, Mohammed Morsi,
exercised his authority over the military establishment, and dismissed Field Marshal Mohammed Tantawi. However, the
reality of the situation is rather more complicated. The context of the move is exceedingly important, as we try to understand
what possible scenarios are afoot for Egypt's constitutional future, and its foreign policy dynamics.

Without delving into the intricacies of Egyptian political dynamics, a few developments are necessary to take into account.
Prior to the start of the Egyptian Revolution on 25 January 2011, the military leadership (the Supreme Council of the Armed
Forces - SCAF) occupied a particularly privileged space within Egyptian society. They acted as a state within the state: their
many economic interests were theirs to govern as they wished, and their internal structures were not subject to civilian
oversight. Hosni Mubarak, in this regard, was not a civilian authority: he was a military one, and part of the same structure,
which simultaneously occupied the president's office.

In the aftermath of the forced resignation of Hosni Mubarak, made possible by the intervention of SCAF, the body then
assumed the powers of the presidency without the façade of elections that Hosni Mubarak had accepted. In the eighteen
months that have taken place since then, SCAF have maintainedvery high levels of confidence from the Egyptian public,
according to regular Gallup polling. However, the continued involvement of SCAF in the governing of the Egyptian state,
appears to have resulted in a slight weakening of its popularity beyond the military.

The Military's Changing Internal Dynamic

What happened within the military is key to understanding what has taken place recently and its future repercussions. The
popularity of the military leadership, represented in particularly by Tantawi and his number two, Sami Anan, was
questionable. The military establishment's track record indicates that its desire is to remain on the sidelines of Egyptian
politics, as long as Egyptian politics remains on the sidelines of its internal affairs. Tantawi and Anan, however, even after the
election of Morsi to the presidency, were continuing to share power that clearly went beyond the interests of the military.
With power comes responsibility - and the military establishment at large didn't, and doesn't, want that responsibility.


Tantawi had the loyalty of some officers within SCAF - but not all of them. There was a new guard that clearly wanted the
military to return to the position it maintained prior to 25 January 2011, with some temporary adjustments. The divide
between this Tantawi clique, and the new guard (led, it seems, by Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, now Defence Minister, and Mohammed
al-Assar), are real. One aspect of this is generational - the new guard is younger, and may have sought promotion, which can
only happen when the old tier retires or dies. Ensuring the position of the military would probably have been another priority.
Some speculate that that the new guard perceived that the Tantawi clique were on a trajectory that, intentionally or not,
would ultimately threaten that position.

This new guard are unlikely to be Islamists. No Islamist would have been permitted to rise to a senior military rank by the
security services had they been suspected of Islamist leanings. The new guard, and the military establishment as a whole, are
pragmatists with two key interests: the economic holdings of the military (including the quality of life enjoyed by the
leadership) and a maintaining of a geo-strategic situation in the region that does not require them to ever go to war. With the
transitional period, they have one more interest: to never be held accountable for any criminal actions that took place under
their watch. A state within a state, indeed.

The Military Seeks to Secure Its Position

This was not a powerful president exercising his authority over an insolent military. This was a coup within the military
establishment as senior officers were forced out by ambitious others. Morsi did not play the key role: he provided cover, and
was a useful interlocutor, who was clearly happy to engage in that manner. Both Morsi and SCAF wanted the Tantawi clique
out, a mutually beneficial arrangement, but one where SCAF undoubtedly called the shots. Morsi certainly has the support of
the Muslim Brotherhood behind him but had SCAF been behind Tantawi completely, then Morsi would have been going to
war with the army, the bureaucracy, the judiciary and the rest of the institutions of the deep state. SCAF is still a far more
powerful actor within Egyptian politics than the office of the presidency or the Muslim Brotherhood. - However, the newly,
self-reconstituted SCAF seems to have decided to step back, and to turn over as much responsibility for running the country as
possible to the presidency.


Some analysts suggest that the recent killing of Egyptian soldiers in the Sinai on 12 August provided a good excuse to affect
this: but the reality is that probably with or without Sinai, this would have happened. The critical factor in this move is not
whether or not Sinai provided the impetus, but whether Morsi was willing to depend on the collaboration of a new guard in
SCAF. If that new guard had not supported Morsi's move, then he would have found himself quite vulnerable. Moreover, it
would not have been unexpected for the SCAF to retaliate with a coup.

It is not, incidentally, beyond the realm of possibility that such a coup might have been possible to sell to the Egyptian public,
had this been an option the army wanted to pursue. Indeed, there were rumours that such a coup was about to take place -
but these were not substantiated. There are other rumours that the US backed the move, and that this support was crucial -
this, again, is wholly unsubstantiated. While it is likely the military notified the US (most of SCAF has strong ties with the US),
and reports do Indicate that they had some advance warning that there would be changes in SCAFAil it is unlikely that it was a
move they knew much about very far in advance. Crucially, it's exceedingly doubtful that the US could have affected it one
way or the other.

The newly reconstituted SCAF has certainly reserved certain rights for itself. Firstly they have retained responsibility for self-
regulation, rather than be under the jurisdiction by civilian authorities. Hence why neither Tantawi nor Anan are due to stand
trial, and why no other senior officer will either. They essentially have 'military immunity'. It's likely also that Morsi agreed, all
too quickly, to two additional items: to ensure that defence policy remains within the hands of SCAF (at the very least, SCAF
has a veto), and to consider the economic interests of the military beyond state purview.


Defence policy impinges, of course, on foreign policy. It is likely there will be, for the foreseeable future, a jointly decided
foreign policy and security policy between the office of the presidency and the defence ministry, with the defence ministry
(SCAF) holding a veto. As a matter of fact, SCAF hold a veto over much of Egypt's affairs. They have the force of arms, and their
popular standing in Egyptian society is such that, if used correctly, they could use that veto without diminishing their public
support.

However, it is unlikely that we will see the SCAF actually be placed in a position by the Muslim Brotherhood where they feel
they need to use that veto. As long as they feel that their interests are protected, and defence policy remains in their hands,
they will leave the presidency alone with the task of running the country. That includes all national problems which are now
solely Morsi's headache. This is not the military submitting to civilian control - this is the military deciding to leave the broader
political scene, subject to the maintaining of its interests and privileges. Several weeks ago, this writer observed that this
would be the smartest strategy for the military, but it was thought that it would take them years to come to the same
conclusion.

Morsi's Wider Ambitions

Some commentators have argued that Morsi, after having found SCAF willing to be neutral vis-à-vis his presidency, has two
more targets. Here, he will find a much more difficult task. The first is the judiciary, full of judges appointed by Hosni Mubarak,
just as the military was run by his appointed generals. In this regard the conflict will be more open, without the secret deals
that characterised the deal with the military. Morsi's appointment of a famed reformist judge as his vice-president shows that
he is serious about reforming the judiciary.
