Madam Secretary,
Given the NYT and AP stories this morning on Egyptian tanks in the Sinai and Israeli concern; I wanted to update you on
the situation. I just finished a secure call with Anne and have sent a secure communication to Dan Shapiro and others
(Cheryl and Jake have copies). David Satterfield has worked this situation masterfully to date but there is reason to be
concerned that we will reach a tipping point and that things will tip in the wrong direction. As a result we have
suggested some steps forward for Dan as Anne and David continue work in Cairo. We will revisit the issue this afternoon
in the Egypt DC as needed. Will keep you posted.
Wendy
