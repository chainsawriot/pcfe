Subject: The World We Want



                  Following up on our conversation yesterday, attached is a memorandum prepared by my associate,
Sarah Teich. It addresses the availability of domain names involving variations of "The World We Want".

                 As you will see, we have various options available to us. While many of the related domain names are
owned, most of them are inactive and likely available for purchase.

                                                                       ############



                 There are many, many books that use that phrase in one way or another. As we discussed, an author
cannot copyright a title. From a quick look, I don't see any of these books as competitive or particularly problematic. A
link follows:



http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb sb noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-
keywords=the+world+we+want&x=11&y=13#/ref=sr pg 12rh=n%3A283155%2Ck%3Athe+world+we+want&keywords=t
he+world+we+wa nt&ie=UTF8&qid=1325776809



              As explained in Sarah's memorandum, one of the authors owns one of the domain names --
www.theworldwewant.org. Information about him follows:



http://giving.typepad.com/theworldwewant/2005/05/about us.html



                   Let's discuss this when you are a moment.
