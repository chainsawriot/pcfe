Worth a look — not least because, as you know, Cui Liru is our "partner" in the US/China/India Track II
Trialogue.

                The country's leading foreign affairs and military experts yesterday called on Beijing to take a tout
                mounting tensions in the South China Sea ahead of a key regional summit in Cambodia this weel
                China should rethink its current policies in handling territorial disputes and act more asse
                strengthen its sovereignty claims over the contested areas, according to panellists who s
                World Peace Forum in Beijing. The suggestions came on the eve of the 10-member Assc
                Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) talks in Phnom Penh today, where the South China Se
                expected to dominate meetings.
                 The mainland speakers at yesterday's forum suggested that existing security mechanisn
                ineffective, resulting in uncertainty over regional stability.
                "The situation in the South China Sea does not look optimistic," said Luo Yuan , a retired
                Liberation Army major general known for his hawkish view.
                'While China's neighbours are under public pressure [to act upon the disputes], the Chine
                faced with the same pressure."
                Luo, vice-president of the China Strategy Culture Promotion Association, added: "China's
                been tested to its limits, and there is no room for further tolerance."
                Beijing has locked horns with Hanoi and Manila over conflicting territorial claims in the Sc
                in recent months.
                The tensions continued to escalate with Hanoi and Manila opposing Beijing's plan to este
                newly-created prefectural-level city to administer the Spratly, Paracel and Macclesfield B
                chains and nearby waters.
                Yesterday more than 200 protesters took to Hanoi's streets in the second anti-China rally
                Vietnamese capital this month amid heightened territorial tensions over the South China
                Cui Liru , president of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said
                previously focused too much on shelving disputes and seeking common grounds with its
                He said a new approach was needed because of changes in the situation.
                'We have come to realise that perhaps we need to do more in terms of demonstrating Cl
                sovereignty [over the disputed territories]. Something has been done, but we still need to
                said.
                The tension between Beijing and Tokyo over the disputed Diaoyu Islands in the East Chi
                the Senkaku Islands by Japan, also flared up last week after the Japanese government
                that it was in talks with the private owner to buy the island chain. Cui said most regional
                mechanisms have failed to achieve their purpose, which is to foster stability, because of
                among countries and the implications on their foreign policies due to domestic pressures
                "In the foreseeable future, say at least in five years, the Asia-Pacific region will still be sh,
                feature of a transitional period, which is characterised by a certain level of chaos," he sai,
                Beijing has turned up the heat on the rival South China Sea claimants by announcing las
                establishment of Sansha after Hanoi passed a maritime law that requires all foreign ships
                through the disputed waters to notify Vietnamese authorities.
                The Chinese defence ministry said last month it was considering setting up a military con
                the new city.
                "It is necessary to set up defence facilities when we establish a new city, especially wher
                border issues," Luo said. "The military unit in Sansha will be equipped with a high-level c
                management mechanism, and focus on air and navy defence."
                A highlight of the Asean Regional Forum this week will be the security dialogue attended
                ministers from 27 nations on Thursday - an event that has seen many countries express
                concern over the South China Sea in the last two years.
