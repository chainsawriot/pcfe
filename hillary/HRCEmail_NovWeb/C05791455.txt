Subject: Syria today (Sunday, 7/22)

Here's a quick summary of what we've heard from contacts in the past 36 hours. Bottom line: the situation on the
ground is very fluid, with the rebels making important strides but the regime nowhere near giving up and proving it can
retake key areas at the cost of increased violence, increased defections and loss of control elsewhere.

There are two issues that require consideration/decision:

                                                                                                                            1.4(D)
                                                                                                                            B1




More news:

-- Activists say Syria's death toll has topped 19,000. We think this number is credible.

-- Fighting in Damascus diminished slightly after the FSA withdrew from the central neighborhood of Midan, although
activists report heavy shelling of the northern neighborhood of Barzeh today, which is close enough to be heard in
central Damascus.

-- After the FSA withdrew from Midan, regime thugs (shabiha) reportedly went house-to-house killing many civilians,
                                                                                                                            1.4(D)
                                                                                                                            B1
-- Even as the regime regains control of parts of Damascus, defections are increasing and the FSA is capturing additional
border crossings, including one more apiece on the Turkish (now three) and Iraqi (now two) borders.

-- Fighting in Aleppo also has escalated. Contacts say the FSA will make a major push in Aleppo this week, and the FSA
announced this morning that "the fight for Aleppo has begun."

-- Numerous FSA units have agreed to a "code of conduct" statement, pledging to uphold the rule of law, protection of
minorities and primacy of civilian leadership in their effort to topple the Asad regime. The statement will be released
publicly soon.

-- Several FSA units and revolutionary councils plan to declare Idlib a "liberated zone" in the coming days, calling for
protection from the international community.
