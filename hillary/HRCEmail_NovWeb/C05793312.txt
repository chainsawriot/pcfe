                                               Student leaders are a powerful force in the Global
                                               Zero movement and have been an essential ingredient
                                               of Global Zero's successes over the last three years.

                                               In February 2010, 31 Global Zero student leaders from

                                               launch grassroots campaigns in their countries. Since
                                               that time, young people from around the world have
                                               joined the movement - taking Global Zero to their
