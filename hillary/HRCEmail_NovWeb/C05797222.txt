Frank and Sinir were just on the phone together with the Deputy.

- Sinir expressed condolences;
- He said the GOT would do all they can to help;
- The GOT response thus far has been very good;
- They are aware that the Secretary may be reaching out to Davut, who they believe is in Belgrade right now.

I just spoke to Frank. Confirmed blast at 1:15 pm, gate 2. Lost one guard, two wounded. Including well known
journalist Didem Tunjay.
Frank is with mayor and police chief now. Asked that we try to set up primary points of contact for info flow.
