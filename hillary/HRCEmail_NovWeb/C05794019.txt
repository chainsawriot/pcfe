Subject: HAK State of Play - and Talking Points

HRC:

Attached is the latest update of the tick tock of DOS engagement with HAK's team at Yale (Ted Wittenstein et
al) and his lawyers from Arnold and Porter {Jeff Smith and Phillipe Oudinot).

The bottom line is, the parties all agree that NARA has the same records that the Library of Congress has; that
what HAK wants is for DOS to use our leverage to get the LOC to release them/make public their DOS
collection (for which he has paid $150K to facilitate); and that we can achieve the same outcome vis-a-vis those
DOS particular documents by giving Yale a copy of what NARA has (which is co-extensive with the LOC
collection as far as DOS documents are concerned).

I have highlighted in yellow the key parts.

My recommendation for when you see Henry is to say:


"Henry - I know our teams are talking -- I specifically checked in after our call;

They seem to be working toward a solution of making copies of DOS documents available to Yale, including
some new materials that are not at NARA or the LOC

Let's let them finish and present a solution to us.

I have asked our folks to push with your team to have a resolution presented to both of us this month

My goal is to make sure Yale has a copy of everything we have so your collection there is complete with
respect to DOS documents."
