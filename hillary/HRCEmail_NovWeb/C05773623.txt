Iran to suspend nuclear talks until sanctions are lifted: website

June 21 - An Iranian website close to moderate circles of the ruling establishment in Iran suggests suspending
negotiations with the major world powers over country's nuclear program until the sanctions are lifted.

The website

baztab.net which for its critical stance against the Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is filtered, suggests that the
West would continue talks with Iran to the very end and would use it to "persuade the public opinion of its peaceful
intentions, saying it has been trying to settle its dispute with Iran through diplomatic ways however it remained no other
alternative but attacking Iran."

Baztab believes there would be no benefit to Iran to negotiate but also suffer from sanctions, "especially when it is also
downgraded to experts'
meeting."

"We have to change the game," proposes the website adding: "Iran has to tell
5+1 and Catherine Ashton that in case of implementation of the sanctions
against the central bank and seizing of oil purchase by EU, talks would be suspended."

On June 28, the US will instate sanctions on companies working with Iran's central bank; days later, on July 1, the
European Union will launch an embargo on Iranian oil, which could knock out a third of the country's
revenue./-

 Rafsanjani attacks world powers"dishonesty'




Jun 20 - The former Iranian president has criticized world powers for their "bullying" and "dishonesty" in recent
nuclear talks in Moscow, newspapers reported on Thursday.

The comments suggest that Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and his allies, who support the broad lines of Iran's controversial
nuclear program but are more open to compromise with the West than hardliners, are also frustrated by the lack of
progress in negotiations.

"The talks proved that the Western side is (not interested) in interaction and they are not honest. They have based their
policy on bullying alone,"
Rafsanjani was quoted by several Iranian dailies as telling a group of clerics. He also urged Iranian unity to thwart its
enemies./-
