But we followed up based on what Lona told me and raised idea of Europe at end of June. They would clearly move
things to make it happen. It will be a good idea. And Geneva makes more sense if that becomes concrete

Short call. S said she wants to see Saeb in Washington next week, and will have David call to coordinate schedules. S
also said she would like to see Abbas sometime, though no mention of location or timing — that part was very general
and vague. She noted she had spoken with Bibi today and seen Judeh yesterday, said
