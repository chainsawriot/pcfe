If you want to do for Miliband, no reason not to. But as a written submission, not an interview. That way it takes 0% of
your time, 100% Jake's problem.

I defer to Philippe on whether this makes sense. From my end, there are plenty of things to talk about.

Dear Hillary:

I saw Theresa Loar at a reception last night and she was speaking very highly of her friendship with you. I hope all is well.

I am writing now with a request. In June (mid/end) I am guest editing one issue of the New Statesman - a (serious)
British weekly current affairs magazine. This is not the start of a journalistic career! But politics here is pretty stuck and
this is one way of providing some ventilation.

I would love to have an article from you in the magazine (or an interview). It could be about the state of the world
("Why America is not in decline") or "How globalisation can be made progressive". Or it could be more personal - about
your passion for women's empowerment as real foreign policy. Or just "10 things I have learnt as Secretary of State". (I
assume something more political is ruled out.)

Really the choice is yours - but I hope it would be a chance to set out something you care about.

Many thanks. I hope this works out.
It would be a real boost.
