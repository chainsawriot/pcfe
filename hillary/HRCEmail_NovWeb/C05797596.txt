Subject: Rosen



Nir Rosen is an American journalist known for his writings on the rise of violence in Iraq following the 2003
invasion, which form the basis of his first book, In the Belly of the Green Bird (2006).91 He spent more than two
years in Iraq reporting on the Coalition occupation, the relationship between Americans and Iraqis, the
development of postwar Iraqi religious and political movements, inter-ethnic and sectarian relations, and the
Iraqi civil war.

He has regularly contributed to leading periodicals, such as Atlantic Monthly, the Washington Post, the New
York Times Magazine, the Boston Review, and Harper's. He contributed to the footage of Iraq in Charles
Ferguson's documentary No End In Sight and was also interviewed for the film. Rosen has written extensively
against the surge in Iraq, notably in a March 2008 article for Rolling Stone.

From 2005 to 2008, Rosen was a fellow at the New America Foundation. In September 2007, he was the C.V.
Starr Distinguished Visitor at The American Academy in Berlin.0-1 On April 2, 2008, Rosen testified before the
U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee at their hearings on political prospects in Iraq after the surge.171181

From 2008 to 2011, Rosen was a fellow at the Center on Law and Security at the New York University School
of Law,I21 until his resignation in the wake of his controversial statements about Lara Logan's sexual assault in
Egypt.1-111

In March 2011, Mary Kaldor, Co-Director at the Center for Global Governance at the London School of
Economics had hired Rosen as a research fellow to work on North Africa.1111 This created controversy due to
Mary Kaldor's involvement in the LSE Libya Links affair.1-111 After two days, Rosen resigned from his position
as a fellow at the London School of Economics. An LSE spokesman said, "Nir Rosen today resigned his
temporary visiting fellowship at LSEâ€”which was an unpaid position."M

[edit] Controversy
In February, 2011 Rosen commented to his Twitter account regarding Lara Logan, Chief Foreign Affairs
Correspondent for CBS News, who was beaten and sexually assaulted in the February riots in Egypt.M- "Jesus
Christ, at a moment when she is going to become a martyr and glorified we should at least remember her role as
a major war monger," wrote Rosen. Rosen suggested that she was trying to outdo Anderson Cooper, who
was attacked but not sexually assaulted just days before, and that it would have been humorous had Cooper
suffered a similar assault, saying "it would have been funny if it happened to Anderson too."11611171 Rosen later
posted an apology on TwitterM and resigned his position as a fellow at New York University's Center on Law

and Security.1-191Rosen stated that he did not read the CBS News press releaseu 41 to which he had linked, and
that at the time of his comments he did not know Logan's assault had been sexual.

[edit] Beliefs & views
Rosen believes that Hezbollah is not a terrorist organization, but rather a "widely popular and legitimate
political and resistance movement". In April 2008, when asked by then-Senator Joe Biden what could be
done to improve the situation in Iraq, Rosen replied, "As a journalist, I'm uncomfortable advising an imperialist
power about how to be a more efficient imperialist power. I don't think we're there for the interests of the Iraqi
people. I don't think that's ever been a motivation."1221
