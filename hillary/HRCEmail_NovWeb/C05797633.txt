Subject: Electric Burma Concert with Aung San Suu Kyi

Robert/Cheryl,
I'd appreciate it, if you would let HRC know that she will soon be receiving an invitation from                 Julie Yannatta
to attend the Electric Burma concert in Dublin on June 18 in honor of Aung San Suu Kyi.
Julie is executive producer of this concert which will benefit Burma.
ASSK is traveling in June outside of Burma for the first time in 25 years, first to Oslo to receive her Nobel Peace Prize
awarded in abstentia in 1991, and the next day to Dublin for the concert in her honor, the first such she has ever
attended. Bono will head line with a variety of other artists. The event will be held in the elegant 2000 capacity Bord
Gais Energy Theater designed by architect Daniel Liebskind.
Julie and the organizers hope that Hillary's schedule might allow her to attend. Hillary has met Julie on a number of
occasions, and when Hillary as First Lady made her official visit to Finland when I served as US ambassador, Julie was
present at Hillary's meeting with the leading women of Finland including the Minister of Defense, the head of the
Central Bank and the Foreign Minister. Julie was in the group photo taken in front of my residence. Earlier this year, Julie
 co-produced an album of Bob Dylan songs performed by 80 artists, "Chimes of Freedom", to benefit and celebrate the
 50th anniversary of Amnesty International. The year before she produced, "Instant Karma Darfur", a collection of John
Lennon songs to benefit Amnesty.
Needless to say
Thanks,
Derek
