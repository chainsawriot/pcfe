Talked to      this morning. He appreciated call, but is not happy about message. He will think about "swap" idea, but
                                                                         is containing his enthusiasm at this point. But
he'll think some more about it over next couple days.

I told him timing was theoretically this summer, but that would require unusually fast movement on Hill.
