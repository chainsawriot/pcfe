Did you all know she got MARRIED?! Yahoo! Not sure if a letter went out already and know you are heading to Africa -
but there is a reception for her Saturday - if you ever do letters unsigned and send original signed later.

Have a great time in Senegal - we just credentialed the new Senegalese Ambassador yesterday - such a beautiful family.
I remember our visit there ages ago and that we thought the people were tall and stunning. The new Ambassador was
the then President's asst during your First Lady visit. Ahh the circle of life... Safe travels!                           1
