Subject: Prince Saud on Lebanon

Staff assistants: can you flip this to the other side and forward to Embassies Beirut, Damascus, and Riyadh, to Ambs,
DCMs, and Polchiefs? SBU -- entire text. Thanks.

I met with Saudi FM Prince Saud al-Faisal, accompanied by Saudi Ambassador Adel Jubeir, for 75 minutes in Prince
Saud's Waldorf Towers suite today.                                                                                          1.4(B)
                                                                                                                            1.4(D)
                                                                                                                            B1




Saud also said that Saudi Arabia remains firmly behind the Special Tribunal for Lebanon and keeps telling the Syrians and
others that there is no stopping the STL's work. He insisted Saudi financial support will continue.

Saud asked our positions on Lebanon. I told him we wanted the STL work to continue, wanted Hariri to stay as PM
                                                                                                         Nor did we
want Lebanon to fall off the cliff into violence.

Comment: the conversation was friendly and reassuring (and more nuanced than Blackberry typing can capture).
