Subject: Entries - Preliminary



They are still rolling in but some of the entries:

   "Seated left to right: See no evil, do no evil, hear no evil, and Evil."

   "So, this is the Evil Feltman who Hassan keeps going on about?"

    "Mind if I remove my tie?"

    "What, I came all this way and not even a cup of tea?"

    "Is that a centrifuge behind the curtain...?"

   "This totally screws my chances of getting invited to the Secretary's holiday party."

   "What meeting with the Ayatollah? That was Tom Cruise wearing a Jeff Feltman mask. And shoes."

   "Ayatollah, Ted Williams once said that if you hit .400 you don't have to wear a tie. What's your excuse?"

   "Mr. Feltman, Imam Musa Sacir once sat on that very sofa. How much you remind me of him."

    "Mr. Secretary-General, keep Feltman quiet or I'll go nuclear."
