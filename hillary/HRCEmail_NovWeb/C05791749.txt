Subject:                          1st Daughters



Long story as to why I thought to research this, but here's another historical trend working against Mitt Romney and his
brood of only sons: it has been half a century since we've had a President without a daughter. It's happened only once
in the past 80 years.

• Obama: Sascha & Malia
• Bush: Jenna & Barbara
• WJC: CVC
• Bush: Dorothy
• Reagan: Maureen
• Carter: Amy
• Ford: Susan
• Nixon: Tricia & Julie
• LBJ: Lynda & Luci
• JFK: Caroline
• Ike: (sons only)
• Truman: Margaret
• FDR: Anna
