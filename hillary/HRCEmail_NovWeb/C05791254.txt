Dear Jake — just want to make sure you saw this. This unprecedented commitment to Afghanistan by
Sweden highlights our shared values and interests. The Swedes are eager to take the relationship to a

Subject:                   Sweden: Unprecedented announcement on development assistance commitment to
                           Afghanistan in Tokyo


1. (SBU) Summary: On July 12, we met with Sweden's Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan
(SRAP), Niclas Trouve, to get his read-out of the recent Tokyo conference on Afghanistan and to learn
more about Sweden's significant development aid announcement. Trouve said that Sweden wanted to
demonstrate its long-term commitment to Afghanistan and therefore has decided to provide $1.2 billion
USD in development assistance to the country between 2015-2024. He underlined that this commitment,
in terms of amount and number of years, was historically unprecedented for Sweden. Particularly
noteworthy, he said that this commitment was only a framework of aid strategy and not a "normal"
strategy. He highlighted that the commitment enjoys broad consensus in the Swedish Parliament after
consultations with major opposition parties. However, he emphasized that he made clear to the
Afghans in his conference speech that the support is "not unconditional." End Summary.

Swedes commit to $1.2 billion over 10 years...

2. (SBU) On July 12, we met with Sweden's SRAP Niclas Trouve, who led the Swedish delegation to Tokyo
last week. Trouve started the meeting by underscoring that the lack of high-level representation from
Sweden (FM or State Secretary) should in no way be seen as a signal of non-interest from Sweden. On the
contrary, he underscored, Sweden's significant development aid announcement at the conference should
be viewed as a serious and long-term commitment. Sweden will contribute, during the so called
Transformation Decade from 2015-2024, about 8.5 billion SEK (1.2 billion USD) in total development
assistance. This figure corresponds to a 50 percent increase of the current level of Swedish development
assistance to Afghanistan. In addition, Sweden is ready to maintain its humanitarian assistance to
Afghanistan at present levels ($31.6 million USD in 2011), if needed.

3. (SBU) Trouve said that this type of commitment, both in terms of amount and number of years and
without a formal development aid strategy, was unprecedented in Sweden. Normally, Sweden has two-
three year development cooperation strategies. In this case, he highlighted, the ability to demonstrate
Sweden's long-term commitment to the Afghan people and to insurgents was more important. Trouve
described, in broad terms, the framework for this 10-year commitment as the "Five E's for Afghan
Development:" Education, Enterprise, Employment, Empowerment, and Economic Integration. Trouve
said the GoS ensured that this approach enjoyed broad support in the Swedish Parliament, including with
the major opposition parties, the Social Democrats and the Green Party.

...but aid is not unconditional: Afghanistan must continue to reform

4. (SBU) In his speech in Tokyo (text emailed to EUR/NB), Trouve said that he had made clear to the
Afghans that Sweden's support is "not unconditional" and that it "builds on mutual commitments and
mutual accountability." The key part of his speech on this included:

       "The Afghan government must show concrete results in the implementation of its Kabul Process
       commitments. As we enter the Transformation Decade, Afghanistan must continue to reform its
       electoral system, continue to strengthen governance and rule of law, continue to boost anti-
       corruption and transparency measures including the promotion of free media, continue to bolster
       respect for human rights, including women's and children's enjoyment of them. These are
       preconditions for our partnership."

International community must improve coordination too

5. (SBU) Trouve emphasized the need for better coordination of the international community's
development assistance to Afghanistan and said "if there is one thing the international community should
focus on, it is on getting that part right." This is not the first time we have heard this sentiment from
senior Swedish leadership on their desires for better international coordination. In a June meeting
between Sweden's Senior Civilian Representative in Afghanistan, Henrik Landerholm, and Ambassador
Brzezinski, Landerholm said that "the amount of assistance is not really a problem, it is the effective and
efficient coordination" of international aid that "needed to be fixed."

Though Tokyo was about development assistance, surprise that there was nothing on security

6. (SBU) When asked about his impressions from the conference, Trouve said that he was "surprised by the
total lack of discussions about security" but noted that it was appropriately covered at the NATO Summit
in Chicago. When asked about any Swedish contribution post-2014 to the Afghan National Security Forces,
he said there was "nothing new yet." Trouve later told our Ambassador that ANSF funding "had not been
decided yet." However, speaking on security issues, Trouve said that Sweden would start withdrawing
troops by the end of this year and transfer into a "Nordic Plus" constellation, which means that troops
from Sweden, Norway, Finland and Latvia will all be co-located at Camp Northern Lights in Mazar-e Sharif
by April 2013 for the remainder of the transition period. Trouve said it was a "good solution since all the
countries can make better use of the resources that are still left in Afghanistan during the withdrawal and
this type of cooperation is in line with Nordic Defense Cooperation (NORDEFCO)." He confirmed that
Sweden was still committed to have 200 trainers in Afghanistan post-2014, but it would likely "require a
UN mandate." Finally, Trouve could not emphasize enough how interested Sweden was regarding NATO's
views on the situation post-2014. He underscored that if NATO is counting on Sweden to contribute post-
2014, "then Sweden also wants to be part of the planning process early on."

Bildt tweets on the issue

7.(U) In response to the announcement, FM Bildt, who was not present in Japan, tweeted "At Tokyo
conference today, we said that Sweden will help Afghanistan 2015 to 2024 with 1.2 billion US dollars. This
is a 50% increase."

Comment

8. (SBU) Despite Sweden's reluctance and current "non-answers" to provide direct funding for the ANSF, this
historically unprecedented announcement demonstrates Sweden's continued long-term commitment to
Afghanistan. With assistance programs in Afghanistan dating back nearly 30 years, Sweden's new
commitment with broad political consensus is significant. By the end of next year, Afghanistan will be
Sweden's number one recipient of bilateral foreign assistance; the 2015-2024 plan will continue that status.
