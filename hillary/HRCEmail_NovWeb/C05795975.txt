Subject: Pena Nieto's win confirmed by Mexico vote count (AP)

MEXICO CITY (AP) - Mexico's official vote count shows a 6.62-percent victory for Enrique Pena Nieto, the
presidential candidate seeking to return the former autocratic ruling party to power after a 12-year hiatus.
   The count by the country's electoral authority includes a ballot-by-ballot recount at more than half of polling
places.
   It shows Pena Nieto getting 38.21 percent of votes, and leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador with 31.59
percent.
   The count completed Friday showed Josefina Vazquez Mota of the conservative National Action Party with
25.41 percent.
   The small New Alliance Party got 2.29 percent, barely passing the 2-percent barrier needed to preserve the
party's place on future ballots.
