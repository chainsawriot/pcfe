Cheryl,
Hope all is we'll am now on my third visit to Port Of Spain. The upgrades Bea's interior decorator along with technology
improvements has really turned this into a real residence. It has also put the Welters back in excess of 200k.But, she's
pleased and that's what's important.The Embassy staff appears to be responding positively to her apporach.She hosted a
reception for the entire Embassy and insisted that it included the janitors and cleaning staff. I think it surprised the Senior
staff.
I wanted to mention that Bea would still like the Secretary to do her public swearing in whenever her schedule permits.

Take Care,
TonyW.
