Subject:                          Arabic speakers



I've done some research on our best Arabic speakers and unfortunately we don't have a deep bench at the senior level.
                       but not comfortable doing interviews in Arabic on or off air. Same with

I've been told Susan Ziadeh, who is DCM Riyadh and was spokesperson in Baghdad ,is excellent. Dana Smith also good.
After that we have some terrific mid-level officers:

Ana Escrogima
Lawrence Randolph
Cara Clark
Dan Ernst
Josh Baker
Jared Caplan

Will continue to work on this. Spoke with Cheryl about the PJ situation and am also trying to come up with a list of
candidates for spokesperson. Hammer is doing an excellent job on the management side.
