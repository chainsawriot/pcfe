That's very nice of you. We'll get a bunch more for this and also for you to have. Only others coming to mind are Paul
Narain (he quickly wired all the permissions once we decided to shift countries), and maybe Barbara & Isabelle. When I
get the copies I'll also provide a full list.

Thought you'd like to see the cover of Traveler. We only have hard copies (which we'll bring in), so this is an actual
photograph Caroline took of the cover.
