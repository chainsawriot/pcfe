Dear Cheryl, your farewell made me weepy and filled me with a slew of memories and much gratitude. You've really put
yourself out in every way and we're all the better off for it â€” our country, our Secretary, the Department and all of us
who got to be a part of your team. I hope there is a tad slower pace ahead, and I have no doubt that THE family will
continue to be a major part of our lives. You are fabulous in every way and, even more importantly, caring and
committed to all that matters. Thank you for all the support you gave me. I'm ever grateful.
Melanne.
