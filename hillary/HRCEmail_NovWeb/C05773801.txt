Hillary,

I read Anne Marie Slaughter's piece in the Atlantic                                      I don't know of a boss who has
been more understanding about work-life balance with her employees - in really high pressure situations - than you.
Now her piece definitely praises you but makes a number of arguments about a culture of face time, and working round
the clock to show effectiveness, etc, - all things you never required and what made it much better to work for you than
other people.

I want to write about this. About the flexibility you showed - even in the highest pressured moments. It's not easy to
have a leadership career and have kids, but great bosses see it makes sense to show flexibility in order to get better
results.

And honestly, how are we going to have more women leaders if women are sent a signal it's impossible?

However, I certainly don't want to cause a                                     Even a nuanced piece will be susceptible
to that.

                                                               though I'm sure you have 7 million things that are more
important than this, I wanted to check in for your thoughts.

Thanks again so much for doing the India Abroad video. I appreciate it very much.

Neera
