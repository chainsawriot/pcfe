Ok. I'm running late so timed may have to be adjusted a little.

Madame Secretary,

Huma and Lona mentioned to me that you would like to see Phil today. I've asked him to stop by at 9:15. Wendy also
would like a few minutes with you to continue your conversation from yesterday. I've asked her to come by at
9:30am. The large Monday meeting normally at 9:15 has been postponed due to the inclement weather. I will have an
updated mini on your desk and go over this with you when you arrive in the office.

Claire
