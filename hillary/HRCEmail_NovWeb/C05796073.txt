Cheryl --

I'm just following up from last week. I know you spoke to Nick on Wednesday. I thought the ARB session went very well
-- good questions and discussion with the panel.

I was planning to leave for Africa today, but have postponed my trip to handle the                tomorrow.
                                                                      It may be good for us to talk tomorrow morning --
I'd appreciate any suggestions or insights you may have in advance of the WH meeting.

I hope you've had a good holiday weekend.

Cheryl
This is a quick note to say that the hearings on Benghazi are going fine, from my perspective. Pat Kennedy has been
terrific -- substantive, precise, and firm in the face of some outlandish behavior. We continue to fend off questions
about the unclass talking points. And I think the
time line narrative is helpful.
I will call to give you a more complete read-out

-Matt
