Been reading about your trip to Africa and hope it goes well. Wanted you to know that I have had a number of
discussions .about relaunching our Africa focused fund now that our US based investment activity has slowed
down a bit. Also working with Emerging Capital Partners, the largest US based VC firm focused on Africa. I've
been advising them on a pan-African media deal and some moves they are considering in education, particularly
in East Africa. Really interesting stuff and happy to see an increase in US investments beyond extractive
industries and infrastructure transactions. As you know I believe that. beyond aid and assistance, the best way
for exerting US influence and strengthening our ties to other countries is through an increase in private
investment. I also think it is critically important to increase US involvement in businesses which touch peoples
everyday lives i.e. SMEs in the consumer goods and services sectors. Hope to go out to South Africa the week
after next with a possible stop in Kenya.

Am scheduled to meet with President Clinton in two weeks to update him on a few of our projects.

Take care.
