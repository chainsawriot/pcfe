Informs me that he believes the process can be picked up right after the Heads of State meeting this week. Since his
conversation with Jake in the last week of Ramadan, the week of Eid intervened. He went there on Saturday after that
and they expressed preoccupation with need to complete their meeting this week. Today is Ministerial and then two
days of Heads of State. Friday is Holy Day so he plans to pick up on Saturday. Obviously the calendar is crunching with
several implications.
But he insists the process is alive. I have briefed Denis on this. All the best. Hope-you are getting good rest. John
