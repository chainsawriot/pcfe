Subject: Georgia's president concedes election defeat (AP)

TBILISI (AP) - Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili has conceded defeat in the parliamentary election and
says the opposition now has the right to form a government.
   Speaking Tuesday on television, he said: "It's clear from the preliminary results that the opposition has the
lead and it should form the government. And I as president should help them with this."
   Early results show an opposition coalition led by billionaire businessman Bidzina Ivanishvili with what
appears to be an insurmountable lead as voters turned away from Saakashvili and the party that has been in
power for almost nine years.
