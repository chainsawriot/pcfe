All,

We're all set for her participation in the Congressional Gold Medal Ceremony on Sept. 19. The event starts at 3pm and
lasts about an hour. They may ask S to be there 15 minutes before hand to do a pre-brief with ASSK and Congressional
participants (exact constellation still being worked on, but it will definitely include bipartisan/bicameral Leadership).
Lona, do you want me to connect you with the person handling the logistics of the event? Would you like to talk before
then and I can download everything I know about the run of show? Just let me know.

I believe Dave will accompany her, as well as any others she would like to have. H will put together any info required, in
case S wants to take advantage of interacting with the other Members of Congress who will be participating in the
event.

Joy

Yes, I'm on leave next week, but available anytime by phone --                  (or Ops) -- and will be checking blackberry.
...am I good to launch an email into the Speaker's office (our best contact there is departing for Afghanistan tomorrow
and it would be good to at least email her tonight to get this on her radar before she goes)?
