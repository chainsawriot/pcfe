Yippee!
  am speaking Sunday evening at the Church of the Advent (did I say that already???) at 5PM and meeting with church
leaders afterwards....Could do late coffee it that works...Monday evening is out for both of us   Tuesday evening is a
good possibility. I'm working with Shepherd Smith and others for Hill visits around global health, as well hopefully as
WH visit on same subject. Are there any Dems or others you might suggest? No pressure... .you don't need to think
about my stuff just curious. Reauthorization of PEPFAR is a BIG deal to me, and I'm looking for ways to use my voice
to encourage strong bipartisan efforts towards that for 2013 Thanks, Burns....praying for you today!
