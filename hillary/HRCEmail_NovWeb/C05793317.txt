                                        MEMORANDUM

   RE:            Domain Names: "The World We Want"


                  Per your request, I have investigated the availability of internet domain names

   derived from or related to the phrase "The World We Want." By way of summary, the most

   desirable names related to this phrase are already owned. However, at least one owner is plainly

   willing to sell and others appear to be potentially receptive to purchase offers.

                  One of the most desirable domain names would be www.worldwewant.com. It

   was purchased on September 21, 2011 for only one year, and is owned by a company based in

   Denver, Colorado called Huge Domains. I looked up the website for Huge Domains and learned

   that it is a company whose entire business model revolves around purchasing domain names en

   masse and then reselling them to others at premium prices. By searching the company's website,

   I found that they have the domain name www.worldwewant.com listed as being for sale for a

   purchase price of $1,195. They do not appear to own any other closely related domain names. It

   appears that the domain name could be purchased simply by providing contact information and a

   credit card.

                   The other most desirable domain name would likely be

   www.theworldwewant.com. It is owned by a Canadian company called David Lavin Agency,

   Ltd., and its registration is currently set to expire on April 29, 2012. However, this registration

   was originally purchased on April 29, 2003, and I would infer that after holding the domain

   name for nine years, the owner is not likely to let it expire this coming April. Based on its

   website, the Lavin Agency is a speakers bureau, which provides and manages speakers on a

   range of topics. The domain name appears to be related to one of Lavin's speakers—a Canadian

   woman named Jennifer Corriero, who focuses on topics related to the powerof technology in the

   modern world. One of her speeches is titled: "Taking Our Place In the World: Young People,

   Technology and the World We Want." The domain name itself is not being actively used by

   either Lavin or Corriero, so it appears they are holding on to it because the phrase is used in one

   of her standard speeches. Because the owner of this domain name is known, we could contact

   them and offer to purchase the registration. In all likelihood, Lavin and Corriero would seek

   assurances that the domain would not be used to compete with or disparage Corriero. My guess

   is that we would not succeed in reaching a deal unless we disclosed the identity of the domain

   name's owner and purpose—or at least disclosed enough information to provide the current

   owner with whatever assurances it wants. I think it is reasonable to assume that this would be

   the most expensive name to purchase, in light of the owner's substantive use of the phrase and

   long-standing ownership of the domain name.

                  Two more domain names are owned by a person in France named Marc

   Bretonniere. Mr. Bretonniere appears to be an actor who has appeared in a number of

   unremarkable French television shows and movies. (He also appears to specialize in doing

   voice-overs for American movies that are re-recorded in French.) He owns www.the-world-we-

   want.com and www.theworldwewant.net. He is not actively using either of these domain names.

   change." It is not clear whether the blog / domain name is owned by Mr. Karoff himself, TPI, or

   fans / advocates of his work. The writing on the blog does not appear to be by Mr. Karoff, but

   rather is commentary and support for his writing. It is hard to predict how receptive the owner of

   the domain name would be to an offer to purchase. While the blog is now used extremely

   infrequently, the fact that it is still used and is used to promote sales of the book lead me to

   believe that we would have a difficult time persuading the owner to sell.

                  The following domain names appear to be available for purchase:

   worldwewant.net; worldwewant.biz; worldwewant.us; theworldwewant.us;

   theworldwewant.info; theworldwewant.co; theworldwewant.biz; world-we-want.com; the-world-

   we-want.net; the-world-we-want.org; the-world-we-want.us. Also available are all variations of

   world-we-want (i.e., dot corn, dot net, dot co, dot org and dot biz). None of these are likely to be

   the most ideal candidate for a primary website, but we could purchase any one or more of them

   to ensure that others don't acquire or use them.
