FYSA - Kurt sent the below excerpt to Tom in advance of the Dai dinner:

We are on track to conclude several modest US-China initiatives for ARF to highlight our determination for cooperation.
Lippert and I will meet with VFMs Cui and Fu on July 7 in Beijing to conclude a few programs in Timor and on HADR. We
are planning a longer bilat for S and Yang in Cambodia to highlight.

To create the right environment we need Chinese though to follow through on their commitments to "de-escalate" over
Scarborough. We put a lot of pressure on the Phils to step back and if anything it looks as if Chinese are consolidating
their position -- and watching us carefully.                                                                           B5




On Iran Danny will provide you with ample background but we have an army of chefs involved but the food is coming
out of the kitchen very late, bland, and in very small portions.



The Chinese are beginning to more openly express clear exasperation on NK. Even Dai is purportedly frustrated.
