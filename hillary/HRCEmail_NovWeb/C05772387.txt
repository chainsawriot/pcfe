Madam Secretary,

Glad to talk if you have time enroute to WH. Bottom line pts from Baghdad meetings today:

- Allawi focused for moment on SOL-Kurds-lraqiya coalition. Hasn't dismissed ISCI option, but concerned that Adel "too
small" and about Kurdish reaction. Ready to engage when Jim J presents paper on Maliki power-sharing offers to Kurds
... has talked to Barzani and will see him Oct 11 ... willing to join in 4x2 talks afterward.

   Maliki firm on limiting Sadrists and openness to inclusive coalition with Iraqiya.

  Abd Al-Mahdi still pursuing Iraqiya coalition, believes he could broaden Shia support, but acknowledges that Iraqiya
has drawn back from finalizing agreement.

- Zebari sees key as energizing Allawi to engage, and test Maliki's seriousness.

- Talibani worried about keeping his job, not reassured when I repeated that we had no specific candidates for specific
positions.




All best,

Bill
