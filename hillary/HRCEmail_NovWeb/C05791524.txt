Â» Laurent started off very disjointed, apparently trying to read a prepared speech. When heL
got to energy and the Caracol Park, he seemed to start speaking freely without looking at his
remarks and did a very good, passionate job talking about jobs {'some of these people now
have a job for the first time in their lives and become players in developing their
Country'), haitian dignity and fighting Haiti's poor reputation with transparency and
results. He also lauded that the US has done what no other partner has done in investing
Haiti's future.] He also highlighted the Fort Liberte port that's under development.
