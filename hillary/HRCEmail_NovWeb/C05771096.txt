If it's set to go Thursday am, I think it would be good if you could wait and leave Thursday afternoon if that's ok. And stay
                 longer next week if you want.                                                                                  B6

Quick update on the ME:                                                                                                         B5
                                                                                               Dan Rubenstein is seeing
Abbas in the morning to nail down the Palestinians.
       I have everyone aiming for a Thursday am announcement here in DC.




Now to more important topics â€” me J. I had been intending to take off tomorrow afternoon, Thurs, and Fri to                     B6
                                                         I can push it back a day to depart Thurs afternoon, or I can
help shepherd things remotely tomorrow night and Thursday morning.
