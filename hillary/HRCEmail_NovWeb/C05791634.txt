Subject:                          quick follow-up to "twiplomacy" piece I sent you



I tweeted it out and it was immediately picked up by Ambassador Rao, who sent it out with the following comment:

'article on "twiplomacy" as new way to look at our diplomatic agendas and engage with less traditional players.'

Might make sense for you to have a round-table w/ DC ambassadors on how to do govt-to-society diplomacy. Very
interesting that India would pick up on this.
Best,
AM
