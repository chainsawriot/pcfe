Sorry for the long email.

Senator Menendez just pulled me aside on the margins of his meeting with Ambassador Wayne and explained he's been
disappointed with some of our Western Hemisphere ambassadorial nominees.




Menendez asked if he should call the Secretary to voice his concerns about the Western Hemisphere noms. I told him
that wouldn't be necessary. He asked if he should talk to Cheryl, and I said I would take that back.

Cheryl, hate to add to your plate, but can I share your contact information with Senator Menendez? Or is there
someone else you want to return his call?

Thanks.
