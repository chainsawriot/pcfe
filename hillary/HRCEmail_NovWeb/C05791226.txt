Subject: Cambodia: BKL Group to be Released

Jake, Kurt, Dan:

Cambodian State Secretary Ouch, traveling with FM Hor Namhong, called me just now, saying that
the FM wanted to pass a message to the Secretary. According to Ouch, the BKL group of13 women,
convicted for protests involving land rights, will be released. He wanted S to know this, as she had
raised it yesterday with FM Hor Namhong.

I also talked with Ambassador Bill Todd. He said there had been some correspondence by the
Cambodian Ministry of Justice, asking the court to review these cases. He will let us know tomorrow
whether this meant the BKL group would be released.

Joe
