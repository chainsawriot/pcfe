Ngozi is that rare breed of leader. Following your trip has been like watching the sisterhood come together in country
after county....all the women you've validated over the years. BTW, everyone is saying you're ready for "dancing with
the stars" now that the clip from South Africa has gone viral. My youngest emailed after watching it and said, "just
another reason I love her so much!"

Keep it going!

She asked me to send greetings to you and I asked her if Nigeria would be part of the Equal Futures Equality Forum. She
also told me she was putting "incentive" money into the budget to reward ministeries that increase hiring women.
