Sure. She made clear that we should look for items that could be funded through a 2011 supp -- which they feel will be
inevitable. I asked both RM and F to get started on that analysis, but I also want to have some conversations at DoD to
see if they are likely to need a supp as well, since alone we face much more risk.

I also think we need to explore a symbolic way to show that we understand the need for belt tightening.

The problem is that the big drivers of our increases really are At Pak and Iraq, and Iraq costs are likely to be very hard to
keep within the box of our proposed budget.

I met with Dave Obey and talked to Nisha right before I left. Nisha said that they would want our priorities to deal with
an allocation that is very low if there is no new budget resolution. The 2011 column of the 2010 resolution is $20 billion
below the presidents budget overall. In comparison all of the cuts in the senate resolution totalled $11 billion below the
pres bud (4 from us and 7 unallocated). I thought it was a bit early to start giving a list of what we would cut if the
allocation is very bad, but will have people work on some recommendations for us to review while Congress is away.

Jack--

When I called Nita last night to brief her on the UN action, she told me her staff and she had been trying to reach you to
get our ideas about what can be cut from our budget as part of the House's required "cutting exercise". I told her you'd
been out of the country, and, in fact, had been our point person on getting Israel into the OECD.

She made clear she wasn't enthusiastic about the process but believes we need to work together to manage. Do you
know about this? And, do you have a plan about how to respond? H
