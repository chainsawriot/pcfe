Dear Hillary,

it's doubtful you'll even see this anytime soon, but writing is an outlet for concern. I am sure you know, and
hope you can draw on, the enormous affection and love of thousands of people who may never have met you
but believe in you and want you well! Heather you do know, and I find the title of her email below quite
touching since she is herself an avowed agnostic. Like so many of us, she is as intent on your return to health as
if you were her closest friend. You mean that much to so very many.

I'm holding good thoughts, and you most certainly are in my prayers!

Love and healing best wishes,

Jan
