As I watch the wonderful final interviews by HRC, I'm struck by one thing. She must be exhaustedâ€”but her staff
must be dead! How you kept up that frantic pace, kept the staff functionally efficiently and still had time for your
personal life is beyond me. But you did and I want to thank you. Great job! So I hope you get some rest and have
some great time with your family. Keep me posted on your next steps.

Ellen
