Dear Cheryl,

After what had to be a pretty trying week I thought you might enjoy this. My two other very favorite people at State are
Eric Goosby and Zeenat Rahman. Well, last week I got in kind of an argument with one of them. Eric and I were
debating who thought the most of you, he or I. He threw me a curve ball when he brought up how great your husband
also is and probably thinks he won the day, but he would be incorrect. In thinking about it I don't believe I've ever heard
anyone say anything negative about you (of course, my wearing the "I like Cheryl Mills" pin might inhibit some people
from being too negative C)). I've asked Shannon Smith to look out for Zeenat when her boss comes over. Have a great
weekend and get a little rest.

Best wishes, Shepherd
