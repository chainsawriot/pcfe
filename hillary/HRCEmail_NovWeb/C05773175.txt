Subject: Update: Gilani SITREP

The election commission just notified Gilani of his disqualification.

Pak CJCS Gen Wynne Chairing a meeting to review situation (this is standard, don't read too
much into it).

The PPP exec committee will choose a replacement tonight (Makhdoom Shahabuddin the
former Health Minister or Ahmed Mukhtar the current Water and Power Minister; both very
senior PPP members) and seek approval from coalition partners.

A vote could come within days. Meanwhile, Z cancelled his trip to Russia so he can chair the
PPP meeting.

Not sure how this will affect GLOC negotiations but we watching closely.

Thanks, Ronita
