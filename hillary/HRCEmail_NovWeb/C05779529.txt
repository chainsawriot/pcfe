I'm        other biggest fan, so if that worked out I would be delighted.

      is terrific too, and at the top of mine and anyone else's list for just about anything. If she does P, one possibility for
Cairo would be                    since Kabul is now going elsewhere. She's a real pro, and has the right personality to
navigate Egyptian sensitivities.                    would be great there. I think the issues Pat mentioned can be
overcome, but we should talk.                   Vvould be another possibility for Cairo; like      he's an Arabic speaker,
with deep experience in the region and many good contacts in Egypt.
