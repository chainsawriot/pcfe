Subject: Wheels up

Just got pre-coordinated email from Maureen that the plane has just lifted off the ground with the Chen family
onboard!! (She was to hit "send" just AFTER lifting off and then turn off her blackberry.)

Great team effort by all in Beijing and DC., especially Bob Wang who had a precise and firm pulse of Chen the
government and the overall situation here in China.

With great pride and hope, Team Beijing is now delivering the Chen Family to America and handing them (and the
resourceful press on the plane) off to you all Stateside!!
