Thank you so much for your trust, patience, wisdom and guidance—we are so lucky to have you, and of course

No 3am call - b/c of you, S answered the 3am call the way every diplomat and development expert could be proud about.

She has had no better team -- and I've worked with her for many years - you are impeccable.

That said, I don't want to disappoint (or not be true to myself) ...

We do have QFRs this week. :)

So let's stay focused (this week).

Love love love you all.

I am eternally grateful.

Guys, great day today. Congratulations to all on the terrific work.

But I want to remind everyone that S is back before SFRC tomorrow morning. So we have to stay on our toes.

We'll be doing a 3am call, and Cheryl will send specific taskings, including:

• Determining the history of introductions

• A framework for a strategy for an introduction
