           Hillary

           I'm so pleased and delighted that your health is steadily getting better. You need and deserve
           the best of times with your family and with whatever you decide to do.

           It's impossible to find words to tell you how much your public admiration meant to me and
           perhaps, more importantly, with the time you took out of your horrific schedule for a personal
           phone call.

           Many blessings my friend
           Inez
