SBU    FYI - Ahead of S-Karzai

       Afghans very focused on bringing          into recon. All agreed this would help; question is which               to   B5
engage. MG pushed for a joint Af-Pak approach to        in the next month.
---> S might repeat this idea to Karzai.

Prisoner Release - Jilani said Pakistan would soon release a first tranche of prisoners (presumably Taliban) sought by
Afghanistan. NFI.

                 - All agreed it would be useful for the Core Group to discuss which         we should engage



Rabbani Visit -Jilani flagged desire for Rabbani to visit Islamabad soon, which MG supported. Trip has been long
delayed.

Af Internal Support for Recon - Brief discussion of Af internal politics on recon. Pakistanis repeated Khar's concern from
Tokyo that not all Afghan factions support recon. Afghans pushed back a bit, noting multiple peace jirgas and "everyone
knows Rabbani and what interests he represents."
