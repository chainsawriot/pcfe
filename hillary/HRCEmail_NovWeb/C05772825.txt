Love Lissa. Adore Politics & Prose. And agree the program warrants further assessment.

But the same argument of unfair pricing is made against all online content sellers, Apple as much as anyone. So that
would argue against using any kind of eReader at all. I get the idea that these companies squeeze independent
booksellers - but it's not like State currently buys 10,000 books from the local store to put in our 3rd floor library and is
replacing that purchase with books from the new Amazon mega store up the block (hypothetical, doesn't exist). This
isn't a Wal Mart situation. State most likely already buys books bulk, so this program simply shifts our purchasing from
one mammoth company to another. Not to mention that the USG has a different responsibility than the average
consumer to obtain the best value possible. Bookstores are definitely in trouble. But because of the technology itself,
not Amazon's or Apple's business practices - which certainly compound the problem, but doesn't create it. Al Gore did
when he invented the Interwebs.

Hillary,
Sorry to bug you about this, but I learned today in a book industry blog
about State's partnership with Amazon for Kindles for embassies. I am
sure there are great benefits to this program, but someday (maybe soon?)
I'd love to chat with you about why this news is so distressing to
independent booksellers across the country. Brad and I appreciate very

deeply that you are a stalwart and steadfast champion of stores like
Politics & Prose and all that they represent to their communities and to
promoting an informed and engaged citizenry. But right now, Indies are in
a battle for survival due in large part to the monopolistic and predatory
business practices of Amazon and the uneven playing field on which we
are forced to compete. I can't convey the scope and depth of this issue -- or
the emotion attached to it -- in one email. But I really hope we can discuss
it sometime.

On a related note, let me know when you're ready for
some more book suggestions. Did you ever read God's
Hotel, the book that Becky edited by the doctor
working at Laguna Honda in SF? It's a must read for
you. If you don't still have the galley, I'll send a hard
copy over to you.
xoxo
Lissa
