I hope you get a chance to read my piece this weekend (You should have a hard copy of the magazine.) It has gone out
to subscribers already (will hit the website on June 21) and I am getting really powerful messages from lots of women
already (gives me a much stronger sense of the millions of messages you must have received over the years!). We're in
                                  — even the weather has cooperated and it's light until 11 pm. I look forward to seeing you
on July 19th; may find some way to participate in the women and tech measurement conference if Strobe will let me out
of FAPB for an hour! :-)
Best,
AM
