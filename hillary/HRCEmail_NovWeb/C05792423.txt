I'm heading off to Bosnia but know you have Rassoul and commission tomw. We tried to get the women's points in your
materials, but think they weren't considered a priority. Needless to say, women's participation in every way will be
critical in the transition. Both last week at UNGA and during my NATO trip, so many of the country reps reiterated what
they said in Tokyo --- that their commitment to the Mutual Accountability Framework in terms of support is contingent
on the role of Afghan women and protection from violence. You get this better than anyone else.
Thx
