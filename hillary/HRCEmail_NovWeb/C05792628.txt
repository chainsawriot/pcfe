Jake,

It's looking likely that the Pakistanis will medevac Malala Yousufzai to the UK. We've confirmed this through both
civilian and military channels in Pakistan as well as through the UK High Commission in Islamabad.

The High Commission received
a formal dip note from the Pakistan MFA requesting assistance and specifying that Pakistan would assume all costs for
her transport and care.

Pakistan has been in contact with two British-Pakistani physicians in the UK. They will most likely move her to the
University of Birmingham Hospital sometime in the next day or two. The Brits are not disclosing the location at this
time.

The Pakistanis have thanked us for our offer to assist. There were, as you know, several private offers from the U.S.,
including from Johns Hopkins, Gabby Giffords's physician, from within the Pakistani-American community, and from the
UAE as well.

Let us know if you have any questions. Will keep you posted on further developments.
