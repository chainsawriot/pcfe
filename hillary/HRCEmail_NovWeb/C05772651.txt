***** ***** ***** *****

Day in and day out, the men and women of the United States Agency for International Development provide
development assistance throughout the world, in environments that are not always safe.

I have been in the Foreign Service with USAID for 24 years and currently have the honor of leading the Office of US
Foreign Disaster Assistance. Thursday I returned from Pakistan where I saw USAID's team and the NGOs we support on
the ground providing hope to millions of Pakistanis after the floods that devastated 20 percent of the country.

The United States Government, through USAID, requires the NGOs we fund to "brand" the assistance they provide to
people in need with the Agency's handshake logo and the words "from the American people" in local languages.
Branding is not just required by law; it ensures transparency when America provides aid. We believe that the people we
help have a right to know where their assistance is coming from. In fact, many Pakistani people often criticize USAID for
not being more aggressive when it comes to branding our aid. The USAID handshake is an enduring symbol of America's
support for Pakistan, well known by many who saw it as children when the Agency was a major contributor to important
infrastructure projects, including dams and hydro power plants that provided millions with crucial transportation links
and power. During my visit last week, Pakistani NGOs urged me to better make our efforts known to the flood-affected
victims, so they are able to appreciate that no country is doing more to help them than the United States. The U.S
government , through USAID is the largest overall donor in Pakistan, and it is important that we are able to
communicate those efforts to the people we are helping.

At the same time, USAID is highly sensitive to the risks of branding in environments where one's association with
foreigners can turn a humanitarian worker into a target. We are in constant contact with security personnel in country;
and where the security risks warrant it, we will continue to grant waivers to the branding requirement for certain areas
and limited periods of time. For example, in Pakistan today, I have granted waivers for NGOs working in the Federally
Administered Tribal Areas and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province. But Pakistan is a vast country and not a monolith. In other
parts of the country ravaged by the floods, where security has not been an issue, we continue to require branding on
our aid.

Weighing the balance between carrying out our mission with transparency and ensuring the security of our workers and
our NGO partners in the field is a constant challenge. We welcome the opportunity to work with all of our implementing
partners to ensure that we get the balance right.
