Subject: Distinguished Award



Hi Cheryl,

It turns out the Distinguished Honor Award (unlike the gold-medaled Distinguished Service Award) requires no
action by the Secretary — the nomination goes straight to the Department's Award Committee, which is
responsible for approving the award. I sit on the Awards Committee and am sure this would be an easy
approval. If you agree, I'll go ahead and process the award that way without having to take this back to the
Secretary.

Thanks,
Steve
