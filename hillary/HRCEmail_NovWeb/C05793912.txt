Monica

Attached is a call sheet for S that Jim Harmon, who is leading our Egypt Enterprise Fund, suggested for a call to the FM of
Qatar to seek their participation in the Fund.

                                                         while she is on the road.

That said, I am forwarding to her so she can make a judgment regarding her time and inclination.

Can you print for her with this cover note?

Thanks.
