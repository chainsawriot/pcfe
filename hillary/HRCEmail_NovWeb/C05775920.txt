            Cheryl Mills
            Chief of Staff
            Office of the Secretary
            U.S. Department of State

            Washington, DC 20520

            Dear Cheryl,

            Some time ago, Secretary Clinton and I had a good conversation about the
            importance of reinstating the Special Envoy for the Americas position I was
            so privileged to hold during our time together in the Clinton administration.

            I've written her today regarding the possibility of moving forward with that
            initiative, and naming             to the role. I believe that         brings a
            valuable range of expertise, from his time in the state house to his fluency in
            Spanishâ€”and I am confident that a dedicated, high-level person in this role
            can be an asset to the secretary and the president, not only in keeping our
            hemispheric relations on track, but in advancing the broader foreign policy
            and national security agenda on issues from trade to climate change and
            beyond.

            I would be grateful if you could ensure my letter receives her attention.

            Thank you as always for your service and for your leadership. Donna joins
            me in sending our best wishes.


                                                   Personally,


                                       *-ThrYN a- c
