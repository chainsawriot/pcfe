Lawmakers Praise Pakistan's Decision to
Reopen Supply Route
By CQ Staff

Lawmakers hailed Pakistan's decision to reopen supply lines for U.S. troops in
Afghanistan that have been closed for months as part of a dispute between
Washington and Islamabad.

The closure has been very expensive for the U.S. military, because troops had
to be resupplied by costlier routes through Russia and Central Asia.

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton announced the deal Tuesday, while
simultaneously issuing an apology for a NATO airstrike last November that
killed 24 Pakistan troops — the incident which triggered the supply route
closure. The apology apparently cleared the way for the resumption of what
has been an essential lifeline for U.S. forces. in Afghanistan.

"This is a tangible demonstration of Pakistan's support for a secure, peaceful
and prosperous Afghanistan and our shared objectives in the region," Clinton
said. "This will also help the United States and [international coalition] conduct
the planned drawdown at a much lower cost."

Rep. Howard L. Berman of California, the ranking Democrat on the House
Foreign Affairs Committee, quickly praised the move, also spotlighting the cost
savings.

"The reopening of the transit routes is important because it will help the United
States and our allies conduct the planned drawdown of troops in an
expeditious and cost-effective manner," Berman said in a written statement. "I
hope this is a first step, and one on which we are able to build upon, in
working with Pakistan to help establish a more stable, peaceful and
prosperous South Asia."

Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta has estimated that using the alternative
supply routes cost the United States an additional $100 million a month.

Just last week, the Pentagon sent a reprogramming request to Capitol Hill,
asking for permission to reallocate more than $8 billion of previously
appropriated funds. More than $2 billion of that stemmed from the higher-than-
expected cost of using alternative routes to supply troops in Afghanistan.

South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, an Armed Services
Committee member, also called the move "a good step in the right direction"
and said that the terms Clinton negotiated were acceptable for U.S. interests.

But he called for better cooperation when it comes to counterterrorism.

"If the Pakistani military intelligence services would engage in aggressive
efforts to combat terrorism in coordination with coalition forces, it would
tremendously enhance our successes in Afghanistan, provide stability to the
Pakistani government and eventually a better life for people on both sides of
the border," he said in a news release Tuesday.
