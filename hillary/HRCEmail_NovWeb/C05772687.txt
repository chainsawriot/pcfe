Subject: UK Aid Worker Might Have Been Killed by U.S. Forces (U)

(U) British Prime Minister David Cameron said aid worker Linda Norgrove might have been killed by her American
rescuers, rather than her Taliban captors. Cameron said Gen. David Petraeus told him Norgrove was possibly killed by a
grenade detonated by a member of the U.S. rescue team, but the full facts have not been established.
