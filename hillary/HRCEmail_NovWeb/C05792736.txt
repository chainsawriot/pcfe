FYI. I called Sergey Kislyak to thank him for helping to facilitate my trip to Moscow next week. At the end of the call he
asked if anything new would come out of the Secretary's visit to Turkey. He said it wouldn't be good for Russia to be
surprised. I told him that this was a bilateral consultation; that of course we all wanted the killing to end in Syria and
move toward the political transition to which we had all agreed. I said that I didn't think there would be something
monumental but that there would be in depth discussions and we would see. I also said that the Secretary would be
meeting with the opposition.
