Subject: Jamaica Economic difficulties

Cheryl,

I hope this email finds you doing well during this holiday season.

Congresswoman Clarke ask that I touch base as it relates to Jamaica and its economic
difficulties with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

In the most recent correspondence with the IMF, they ensured myself and my colleagues that
they are working as diligently and expeditiously as possible, but the Member wanted to make
certain that Secretary Clinton was aware of the issue looming for our neighboring Caribbean
friends.

As mentioned, this is just a courtesy note to inform Secretary Clinton.

take care & keep the faith!
