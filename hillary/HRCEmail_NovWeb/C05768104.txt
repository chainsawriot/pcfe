Haven't seen memcon but will when it's prepared in an hour or so. Everyone is hearing same about Robinson but it's
                                                                                                                           B5

I'm also hearing conflicting things about the orange order -- getting to bottom. They were expected to endorse the
parades process.

I won't call him--I agree. Empey said that Robinson was backing off from threat and he expected vote to pass. Did you
see memcon to report to Declan?

Re: NI latest



1. Shaun got former President George W. Bush to call Cameron yesterday through Paula Dobriansky, the former
special envoy. The report back: Bush delivered the message, he told Cameron he considered it important for Cameron to
get the UUP to complete the peace conference. Cameron said he was in favor.
2. This morning the Orange Order that organizes Protestant parades voted to recommend acceptance of the recent
Hillsborough Castle agreement on future parades by an overwhelming margin, 100-5. Rather than standing outside the
parading commission, this vote is a sign of confidence by Unionism in the new agreement.
3.    All evidence is that the UUP is trying to make Peter Robinson's life impossible. On Thursday, March 4, Empey finally
produced a document laying out the UUP position. Among its demands was one for reorganization of the executive,
conceived to undermine the process. Robinson and McGuinness, in fact, have already asked Empey to head a
commission to make recommendations on making the executive work better. Robinson has told Shaun he is prepared to
help Empey on the education issue, but not if he is unwilling to help on the peace process. Empey is also making a
demand about who can be the justice minister that Shaun characterizes as "insane." The DUP and Sinn Fein have already
created a process not to nominate someone from their respective parties to be justice minister to avoid putting in the
post whose past is incendiary from Sinn Fein. Empey's demand to return to the old process is intended as merely a
wrecking device.
4.    Shaun is having done a poll of NI public opinion that, if it comes out well, will be released to the press by Monday.
Robinson has shared his private polling with Shaun that shows more than 86 percent of the NI public support the
agreement.
5. It is unclear what is going on with Cameron. Is he actually pushing for the agreement or not? If he is, does he have
any influence? Either Cameron is purposefullly not being strong with Empey or he is being spurned, making calls. If he is
not really pressuring Empey, it would be out of a desperate and vain attempt to grab a parliamentary seat in the case of
a hung parliament—a seat that is out of his grasp—the Sylvia Hermon seat.
6.    Robinson has previously declared he would resign if the UUP didn't endorse the agreement. But Shaun says that
he's getting signs that Robinson may be moving away from that position. There is a prospect that Empey's failure tol . 4(B)
endorse might not produce meltdown. If so, that would toll the end of the UUP. Having tried to wreck the agreemer1.4(D)
they would be left stranded. If Robinson stood firm then, didn't resign, triggering new elections, he might well achieB 1
the isolation of the UUP.
