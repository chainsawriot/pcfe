I have to give the Peruvians a date for their social inclusion summit and I want to stop in Central America. I'm looking at
October. The Pathways mtg is in Cali, Columbia Oct 24-26 so we could factor that in as well. It may also be my last time
to go to Mexico to say goodbye to the Calderone Admin and to meet the new.

Anyway, the urgency is Peru so let's decide soon to tell them.
