Subject:                          Tomorrow



Just a heads up that I'll be out of the office tomorrow (Monday), but readily accessible by phone and email.

I'll be keeping close tabs on Middle East developments and will keep you posted.

A few other quick items:

The Pakistan UN event is getting set for the afternoon of the 19th. We're working on remarks for you and on the
associated events.

We're working with Treasury               to close out the Cuba regs so they can be announced before the end of the    B5
month.

Megan has made some useful tweaks to the global health speech and Lissa will incorporate your written edits.

By Tuesday, we'll get you a draft of our Human Rights Council submission (assessing the human rights performance of
the US). Dan Baer has been the primary author - it's quite good despite the difficulties of the project.

You have a North Korea policy discussion tomorrow.                                       but thought it would be
worthwhile to have a blue-sky conversation with experts on this issue.

Some call sheets will be coming your way for key Republicans on START.

That's all for now.
