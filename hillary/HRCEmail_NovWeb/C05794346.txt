Subject                             Schedule



1).There will be a memorial service for B Rapaport in DC on May 15 at 5pm that I have to go to. I don't know where but
Bill is speaking.

2) Can I fly w Bill to California June 14 if one of the events he's doing is a Democratic party fundraiser altho the other is
charitable? What are the rules? Can I fly back w him? But he may fly straight to Brazil according to his schedule. We
need to sort out so I can make plans.

3) The Foundation is holding Oct 25, 29 and 30 for its Gala in NYC so I'd like option of doing. If it is the 25th, that likely
means no Pathways in Cali, Columbia. HUMA--do you know anything more about the date?

4) Bill is having his Foundation retreat Nov 9-11 in Little Rock. Pls put as option for me. And also as option the Club of
Madrid there Dec. 17-18. WE STILL NEED LR DATES FOR THE EXHIBIT ON OUR MOTHERS AND THE AIRPORT DEDICATION.

5) Pls be sure Bill's office knows we have a mtg in the City at 4 on Fridayâ€”same place as one last month. And, I assume
I'm on the 2pm shuttle?
