prisoner Zaganar told us this morning his believes the GOB' s announcement that 651 convicts will be released
represents the 591 political prisoners on the NLD's list along with 60 other prisoners (associated with former
Military Intelligence chief General Khin Nyunt).

 Erin — Our feelers are out through the country with channels established to report information back in on the rumors of
 an impending release. The next information point — at which we can start to evaluate to what extent the rumors are
 true — will be between 9:30 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. Rangoon time (10:00 p.m. -10:30 p.m. EST) when the prisons' normal
 business hours begin. We'll send a flash update from Embassy Rangoon at that point to share what we're hearing. Best
 regards, Doug

Subject: Re: Burma developments//what next?

All,
Loopong in doug sonnek here to provide on the ground info to us as he hears as well plus to heaar our updates.

Just wrapping up meeting here with political and democracy activists, including bo gyi and former political prisoners. The
said min ko naing is among those released but could not confirm others though they think those released jive with what
nyi nyi aung sent. They received their info from their friends currently in prison; their correctional prison guard
connections did not have any information. They did not see aanything on state run media confirming names.

We're meeting with ethnic reps next so expect to hear info on ceasefires as well as news on their people in prison. Will
provide update once meeting is complete.

Derek will be in touch with surin via phone in 10.

On nyi nyi aung's list- names on this are most of the key people we continue to press gob on- min ko naing, ko ko gyi,
gambiran jimmy, khun ttun oo. These guys were imprisoned because of 2007 snd other pol activity and are by far, the
most organized and aactive. Their release, if true, means the gob is serious and is willing to take a risk. This is especially
significant because it is before the by election.

I will continue to provide updates throguhout the day. Our meetings conclude at 630 and I will send a note with a
summary of the day and analysis on the situation. Again- let's be cautious until names are confirmed and if the release is
unconditional (ie didn't have to sign 401 form promising not to cause instability and refrain from politics).

All,
Understand that there is thinly spread staff on burma back in dc. I have access to computers here on chiang
Mai and can help draft if necessary. Let me know as well as any outline of what is needed and I'd be happy to help.

We should also think about a more detailed statement from the podium setting context of all that has been done since
August. We will need to get out and claim the story if releases are this significant. Kurt

Completely agree on all this considering importance of latest developments if all pans out. Also need to discuss w/ASSK
as well as coordinate w/EU and other intls in the process. Getting head nod from CODELs essential, as well as others on
Hill. Believe Rep Crowley is still on the ground so that will help immensely. I will ask to talk to Surin today - I had
promised him the last time I would call after every trip anyway. I'd welcome Burma Desk to outline what's on our list for
consideration.

All,

If there is a major political prisoner release tonight we need to be ready to respond, particularly given ethnic
announcements today.

If they do 655 (as AFP reports, or even a relatively smaller number) and that includes a decent amount from our list of
notables, and a sufficient number of "political prisoners" we need to probably convene tomorrow on next steps.
Challenge will be getting confirmation from multiple sources that the release is of the right composition. After post
confirms, we probably need to move on the "action for action" ledger on Ambos, survey team, and other things on the
list developed prior to S visit.

We need to determine if existing press guidance is sufficient if a major release happens. Could be as easy as just putting
a warm statement at the top and using existing guidance, or being more robust and forward leaning.

With McConnell, McCain and Liberman in Burma in the next 7-9 days they will likely be our first line of senior-level
validation with the government. We need to make sure we work with their teams to arm them with proper pressers and

also help shape their messaging. Does Thurston deploy to NPT to note our support? Does Derek cycle back to NPT? We
need to start the list of questions and issues to think through.
