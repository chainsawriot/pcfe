Gotta ask -- any steer on any non attrib but usable basis (or any basis)?

Subject: Geneva meeting on Syria in doubt

Hi guys â€” A senior P5 diplomat just told a group of reporters that the Geneva meeting on Syria on Saturday is
now in doubt. After initially signaling its willingness to work with Annan's political transition proposal that we
reported on yesterday, he Moscow has today suggested changes to Annan's proposal that the diplomat said
conflict with its previous acceptance of it, and are in conflict with the underlying point of Annan's proposal for
a national unity government.


He said tomorrow's lower-level meeting on Syria is an attempt to salvage Saturday's meeting and figure out
whether there's any point in bringing the foreign ministers of the "contact group" together.

Grateful for checks with key diplomatic sources to find out what their view is. I think we'll need to do a story.

Cheers,
Lou
