Dear Hillary and all.

We arrived at the general hospital last night with 1500 people sick or dying with 40 percent needing surgery. It has no
water electricity or food and very limited surgical suites or supplies It the largest and most well known public hospital in
the city and according to PIH and paul farmer needs to be supported and it's infrastucture needs to be rebuilt.

Right now we have surgeons but not enough operating rooms set up. We
desperately need to get a generator and fuel and surgical lights and surgery supplies not just first aid. There are
hundreds including children with festering wounds needing amputation and emergency
surgical care. The doctors nurses and patients have no food or water.

Can you help get the infrastructure of electricity water and a medical hospital tent for post op patients. We are
operating with headlamps and hacksaws rinsed with alcohol.

If we have the electricity and water we can open 11 operating rooms tomorrow if we get what we need. Can the
military help ASAP and for security of equipment and medication.

Until this morning when       did the first amuptation there was almost no surgery happening at all here in the city and
none at the General.

Five days after the quake with no acute surgical care wounds are
festering patients are getting septic and dying. If we had a little
help with basic servcices we could stop this.

I don't have cell or email at the hospital. Please coordinate with Claire Pierre or Nancy from PIH.

Thank you thank you thank you.
