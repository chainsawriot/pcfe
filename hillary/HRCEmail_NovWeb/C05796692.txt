Cheryl,

Thank you for helping to get Ola into the Morsi event at CGI . Also thanks to you and to S we had an excellent meeting
with the leaders of the Qatari Investment Authority . We need to follow with a memo but I believe they will match the
US funding. If we can get Turkey , Saudi , and AD , we will get to $ 1 B and this Enterprise fund will make a difference as
we invest in the SME sector of Egypt.

Please express my appreciation to the Secretary.

I hope all is well with you.

Jim
