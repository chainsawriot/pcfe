And a note FYI:
Canada Condemns Escalation of Conflict in Aleppo

July 27, 2012 - Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird today issued the following statement:

"Canada is closely monitoring the renewed mobilization of Assad regime forces in the city of Aleppo. It is an
unacceptable escalation of the conflict.

"Canada is horrified by reports of helicopter gunships opening fire on civilians and that the army has massed troops on
the city's borders in preparation for further assaults on its own citizens.

"Canada calls on all members of the UN Security Council to join in condemning these actions, including those members
who have previously supported the regime, and to adopt a strong resolution that contains binding sanctions against the
Assad regime."
