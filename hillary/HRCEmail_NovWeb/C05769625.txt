Hi. You've probably heard from a cavalcade of people on this, but my two cents on                          He's way
smart, ambitious in a good way, a seasoned inside, bureaucratic player who knows how to get things done within a
building and within the government.t
                                                                                He's creative, smart, an action-
Jackson. He will look tirelessly and effectively for ways to get things done. Totally proactive.




You may have all sorts of other considerations in mind, or not think his theory works. I'm just giving you my view that
he's strong, smart and effective.

Hope all well with you.
