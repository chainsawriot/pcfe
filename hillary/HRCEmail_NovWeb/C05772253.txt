Capricia:
- I'd skip samosas for this crew
- can they include dates on table too?
- lamb fish option better than chicken so long as its well cooked. Rice is good

Subject: Dinner on wednesday night

Below  is the menu for Dinner at the WH — asked them to make the canapes more hearty if there will be
waiting time between the press portion and dinner and the lamb option seems the best. As well, for the
items on the table — I suggested that they are more individualized in front of each person's plate.

The breaking of the fast and prayer will occur individually in the hold of each delegation as opposed to
the State Dining Room together. This is to take place just after the press conference and before the
dinner. Between 7:35 and 7:50pm

Please let me know if I can convey any suggestions.
