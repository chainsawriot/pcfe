I did not hear--so what does this mean? When will I get it for a final read? And does Lissa or AMS have the pen?

Not sure if you heard from AMS, but Hoge has given us til Monday. She and Lissa have been going back and forth today;
she said she would send you a clean version tomorrow am which will give you tomorrow and the weekend to line edit,
etc.

A few other items:

I talked to        about UNGA.
         I'll follow up.

I also talked to    bout START -- engaging the former presidents and other Republicans and generally driving to drive
an effective media campaign. He said he would follow up.




The MEPP team is going to recommend that you make a handful of calls to folks like Berman and Kerry to enlist them on
the settlement moratorium. I'll keep you posted on that.

                                                                                                         You'll get
a Framework Agreement paper and the matrix tomorrow evening, as well as a notional scenario. Other materials will
come in Monday night.

Mitchell and I agree that a call Monday and an intensive session Tuesday is the best way to handle the prep. Let me
know if you have a different view.

Separately, I'm going to send you a proposed list of intel deep dives for the fall for your review and approval.
