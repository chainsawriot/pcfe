I rushed to nyc for a meeting at the un. Couldn't get a cab so I got one of those bike buggies with a woman driver.

The whole way to the UN she talked about you and how much she admired you. When we stopped I showed her a
picture of you swearing me in that was on my cellphone. She went absolutely wild with joy.

She said "You tell Hillary she's just the greatest. Tell her 'She's strong and I'm strong! That's why she's my hero!"

I heartily agreed and told her I'd give you the message!
