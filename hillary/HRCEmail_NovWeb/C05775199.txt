I have meant to suggest this before, but today's conversation reminded me again.          's one of the
most impressive people I have seen since coming to DC. She has amazing ties across govt and in
the private sector. I know you said that we were going inside for                 replacement, but
would be amazing in that job. Whoever it is, it needs to be someone who will help us
institutionalize initiatives like the Partners for a New Beginning, which got off to a great launch last
week in New York (w/ Madeleine and Muhtar Kent and a v impressive group for the Board
meeting and then 70 other people came to a larger meeting aimed at those who want to join as
members of PNB â€” it got us great kudos from the WH but is likely to fall apart when I leave
because we need someone of stature on the outside and great connections on the inside to take it
over. I'm working this but I am worried. We also need someone who can help implement the
QDDR recommendations on making public-private partnerships part of our routine way of doing
business.

If is out of the question, I would keep her in mind for other positions.
