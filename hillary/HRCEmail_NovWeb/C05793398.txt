Well, there you go... Admiral Sestak was his Dem opponent, right?

On a different, but also interesting, level tonight I posted on my Facebook page the interview where Romney said people
questioned Wall Street because of "envy" and I said he must have been the inspiration for Miranda from "The Devil
Wears Prada" and her line "Everybody wants to be us." ... A comment popped up from a black woman in my home
county. She said, "Burns, Romney is scary. But I've learned over the past 3 years that I am a Clinton Democrat and if we
don't wise up, dump Obama and put Hillary in then you will see me voting for the scary Republican. Come have supper
when you are home. Love you, Lou." Well, ok... And her comment, which I haven't removed, has been getting a steady
stream of "likes" thru thu the evening...

No good deed goes unpunished. LOL

Democrat-turned-Republican-turned-Democrat Arlen Specter, a former Pennsylvania senator, told the Philadelphia
Inquirer that Democrats should dump President Obama and put Hillary Clinton at the top of the presidential ticket:

Asked during an interview with the Philadelphia Inquirer editorial board Tuesday whether Mrs. Clinton should replace
Mr. Biden, Mr. Specter replied, "That's the second-best alternative. A better alternative is to make Hillary the
[presidential] nominee. As long as we're talking about dumping, let's go to the core problem."

It should be noted that President Obama, Vice President Biden and Organizing for America all spent time and money
defending Specter against a Democratic primary challenge.
