Subject:                            Flag for tomorrow's testimony



Your testimony addresses various critiques to the Law of the Seas Treaty, but one that was deliberately left out was
regarding climate change, i.e. that the Treaty could be used to force the U.S. "to adopt a radical climate change
agenda."

Both Jake and Josh Blumenfeld judged this too far afield and recommended against including it in the testimony
(instead, it is addressed in the Q&A, if raised). But if you prefer to include it in your testimony, just let us know.
