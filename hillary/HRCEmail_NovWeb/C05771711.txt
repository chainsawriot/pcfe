Kris, thanks again for all of your help and kind wishes during this whole term. Please tell Secretary Clinton that 'the last
dog died' after we counted all the absentees and other paper ballots and I had to concede. Her interest in my career
honors me and I'm so sorry I won't be in Congress to support her (and your) efforts. Best        Sent from my Verizon
Wireless BlackBerry
