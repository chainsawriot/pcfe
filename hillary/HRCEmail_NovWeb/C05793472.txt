Bob: I trust you know full well that I did not make any comment to this reporter about the book Hillary was proposing
four years ago, nor the offer we made. I was not approached for this article and even if I had been would never have
said a word. Not only would that have been against my personal code of ethics, but I'm looking forward too much to the
next book!

Hope this finds you well.

Carolyn
