Subject: Reflection... John Wesley on Voting:

John Wesley wrote this in his journal in 1774: "I met those (voting in the) ensuing election, and advised them, 1. To vote,
without fee or reward, for the person they judged most worthy: 2. To speak no evil of the person they voted against:
And, 3. To take care their spirits were not sharpened against those that voted on the other side."
