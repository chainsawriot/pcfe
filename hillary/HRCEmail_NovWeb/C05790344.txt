Jake: I want to give you an assessment of the current situation in Nepal since things could break over the weekend. As
the May 27th deadline to complete Nepal's constitution approaches, it is not clear how much the parties will get done to
iron out the last differences in Nepal's peace process.
                                                      How far forward is the question.

At the beginning of this week, the parties agreed on the outlines of a federal structure, which was a big step
forward.




           It is also possible that we could see the parliamentary trick of stopping the clock, so that negotiations can
continue for additional hours or even days. We will keep you posted.

Have a good weekend. Best, Bob
