Hello Huma: I hope you are happy and well. All's well here in the Upper Midwest. (Jake Sullivan is coming
our way shortly, so I will look forward to catching up with him.) I'd be very grateful if you might pass the
attached message to the Secretary. Kind regards, Eric

Madam Secretary:

I first want to convey greetings to you from




You have so many friends and admirers here in the Twin Cities, and there is so much good work being done
here on public issues of concern to you. For these reasons, I thought I'd take the liberty of asking whether we
could present to you the Humphrey School of Public Affairs Public Leadership Award at a Minneapolis event
sometime next April, at a specific date we could determine that suits your schedule.

The Humphrey School's Public Leadership Awards Dinner is one of the most prominent nationally focused
public affairs events in the Twin Cities, with participation of many hundreds of leaders from the local
community, the state and the region. Previous Award recipients have included George Mitchell, Madeleine
Albright, and Lee Hamilton, among others. It has served not only to honor individuals of great distinction, but
also to enhance the connections between the Twin Cities and the world of policy on national and global
issues. In addition, proceeds from the event have served as a major source of scholarship support for our public
affairs students, a large percentage of whom are of modest means -- and many are among the first in their
families to have attended college.

I very much appreciate that you may not yet be making concrete post-January plans at this point. But if you
might be prepared, in principle, to consider joining us in mid to late April, I'd be very eager to provide
additional information. Your participation would be a source of great inspiration to people in Minnesota and
beyond.

Kind regards,
Eric
