Cheryl

I have reviewed both docs and have given the green light for the post of the CTMO doc. The Prime Minister's
letter is being reviewed as we speak and should go out before noon. Please help us pass them along to the
relevant entity for publication

Subject: CTMO HOPE response to the NYT

Dear Laurent

I hope your travels in Haiti have been productive. I am looking forward to visiting the week after next on July
16/17.

We have had several inquiries from the Hill yesterday based upon the NYT piece on the industrial park - in
particular with respect to the environmental and farming aspects. I understand from Jean-Louis that your team
has prepared a strong comprehensive response yesterday that will be posted on the Huffington Post and that the
draft is with you for review.

I am writing to encourage that it be posted as early today as possible so that it slows the misperceptions based
upon the many inaccuracies in the piece. Can you advise if you anticipate approving it's posting this am?

best.
