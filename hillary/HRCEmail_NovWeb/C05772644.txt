- I told eric we cant conflict with monday mtg. We are doing julia later in the day.
- wh now saying potus has to travel the 15th so they offered the following tuesday. We might have to arrange a call
instead.
- you will have your own pre-brief for kissinger beforehand.
- mullen dinner is 21st. Depending on paris schedule, u can get back for it.
- we didn't know about pc when we scheduled the event. We will try and coordinate a better system
- on raul, he can have ben franklin room if he wants, people usually pick whatever they want. They haven't really been
consulting with us on when they are having it. So we will reach out to sharon hardy.

Line block questions:

Why is the Julia Roberts interview during the time I have weekly depoartmental meeting?

Also, I don't see a mtg w POTUS on the 15th--can we get that scheduled?

I want to have my own pre-brief before the Kissinger event.

And, I notice that the HBO event conflicts w a PC mtg at WH. Now w/Donilon in charge can we get a set time for all the
regular mtgs so we don't schedule conflicting events?

When is Adm Mullen having his small Pakistan dinner? If it's the 21st, can I get back in time from Paris?

If La Raza can pay for a reception for Raul, why is his swearing in ceremony in the Treaty Room instead of the Franklin?
Can't we find a time for them? Also, I won't be able to go to his reception at a hotel since I have to go to the screening
for the Nat Geo special so that day doesn't work so well. What about on the 26th after I get back from NY since Bill will
be in Haiti and could come back to DC?
