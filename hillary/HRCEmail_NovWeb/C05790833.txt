DECLARATION ON SYRIA

(The Ministers of Foreign Affairs of ... (participating countries) ... and the High Representative of the
European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy met on 6 June 2012 in Istanbul at an ad hoc
consultation meeting on Syria. )

Taking stock of the latest developments on the ground in Syria, the Participants condemned the continuing
massacres perpetrated by the Regime and noted with regret that UN-Arab League Joint Special Envoy Annan's
six-point plan is not being implemented.

Emphasizing that the main responsibility for the urgent, comprehensive and immediate implementation of all
the elements of the Annan Plan rests with the Syrian Administration, they concluded that the Syrian
Administration has so far failed to fulfill its commitments under the Annan Plan as well as its obligations under
the UN Security Council resolutions 2042 and 2043 which endorsed the Annan Plan and demanded its full and
complete implementation.

In the face of the Syrian Administration's ongoing failure to abide by its commitments and obligations, and of
the threat that the situation in Syria poses for maintaining international peace and security, they called upon the
UN Security Council to assume its responsibilities and impose measures to ensure the full and unequivocal
implementation of the Annan Plan. In this regard, they invited the UN Security Council to immediately address
the issue of Syria and to adopt a new resolution under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter in order to demand from the
Syrian Administration to implement the Annan Plan within a certain timeframe.

In case the UN Security Council does not respond effectively to the alarming situation in Syria in accordance
with its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, the international
community, acting as a coalition of the willing, would be compelled to take collective measures to protect the
people of Syria.
