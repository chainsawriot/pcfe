See if you could get the box for tonight and ask who'd like to go to fill it.

The play ends this Sunday 1/15 and there are 7:30pm evening performances, Saturday and Sunday 1:30pm matinees.

So tonight is a solid option, tomorrow night you are seeing Maggie, Thursday night you are in NYC for the Met. I have
you leaving DC on Friday on the 5pm shuttle but we could always change that.

I'd love to see the Ann Richards' play before it closes. Can you find out when it plays and if I could get tickets or a box.
Thx.
