Hello Madame Secretary!

I hope you are well.

Only a few more weeks and then you will be able to enjoy a well deserved time of rest and recuperation from an
incredible journey as Secretary of
State. I have been praying for you daily. I think history will place you
as the best we have ever had during some of the most difficult and trying circumstances in our world.

Congratulations.

I know this is an difficult time in our world and forgive me for imposing on mundane matters.

I write to check in on a date for September 2013 and the opportunity for you to be our featured speaker at the 175th
anniversary of the United Methodist
City Society.

I know this is far in advance of the time, but I would ask that we might have a few dates during September or even
October in which we might plan our event for the United Methodists in the New York metropolitan region. We will need
to reserve a banquet space soon and it would be a great help to know of your schedule. Our committee is open to your
schedule and plans.

I also wanted to ask if you would like to meet our new Bishop, Martin D.
McLee. I have become a part of his extended program cabinet since he wants
to focus on urban ministry. He is newly elected but already making a great
impact. Bishop Park is now serving in the Harrisburg area which is called
the Susquehanna Annual Conference.

I had thought Christmas eve might be a nice time to introduce you to Bishop McLee at Mt. Kisco UMC, if you will be
there. However, he will be traveling
on that evening. Judy and I are planning to attend and hope that we will
see you. I am not sure that you have met Rev. Karen Burger, but trust you will on Christmas eve.

If you are going to be in New York toward the end of January, would you be
open to a lunch meeting with the Bishop? We could meet in the city or in
Westchester.

I look forward to your reply or your staff contacting me with some possible dates.

If I don't see you, a very Merry Christmas!

Rev. Bill

Dear Hillary,

I hope you got my thank you note for the wonderful brunch at Easter.

                                             So Thank you again.

I wanted to follow up on our conversation concerning the United Methodist City Society and the denomination in
general. I am attaching my report to the Board of the society (today's meeting) concerning the General
Conference. Unfortunately, being a very positive person, I had to write a
rather negative report.

To some extent, the General Conference is becoming a microcosm of the world
with all the issues that divide us being the center of attention. In a
small way, we need a Secretary of State like you to be in the church to work
with all the factions. Uhm, maybe a new job for you after January, 2013.

The other item I wanted to mention was a follow up concerning your willingness to be the main speaker at the 175th
anniversary banquet of the
UMCS next year.

As we look at our calendar we are thinking of a Sunday afternoon in September â€”September 8, 15, 22, or 29 in 2013.

I think the event would be at the Crowne Plaza in White Plains, or perhaps the Brooklyn Marriott.

To be honest, I want to work around your schedule because it will be such a blessing to us if you are the main speaker.
Of course, Marc and Chelsea and Bill will be invited too.

If these dates don't work, then we can move back to the drawing board.

I hear you were at Matt's last service at Mt. Kisco. I attended the retirement celebration of the pastor he is replacing in
Valley Stream. They are excited about having a young pastor and family and I made sure to tell a
few of them how much I respect Matt.

We have often attended the Drew Church, where Karen Burger has served for the last ten years. She will be different,
but she is very creative in family ministries and outreach ministries. If you would like me to help facilitate an
introduction, I would be happy to do so.

The other bad news I share is that UMCS lost our Head Start contract with Administration for Children's Services. The
Early Learn RFP that we talked about mostly was awarded to large providers and many of the traditional smaller
program providers like us, lost out in the awards. As you know from the news, there is a great deal of concern for the
cuts that Bloomberg has
proposed. We are trying our best to find a way to save our program which
has taken a great deal of energy.

I also want you to know that I keep you in my prayers each and every day.
You are doing such a remarkable job and you are truly a "peacemaker" as Jesus describes for our world.

Have a blessed day. Oh, and Happy Father's Day to Bill.
