Dear Cheryl and Huma:

Lucy Jarvis, a good friend of Secretary Clinton's from New York, asked that I notify the Secretary that Lucy will be in
Morocco planning a positive documentary about Morocco. As you may know, she is an award winning documentary
filmmaker and is going to Morocco at the ripe age of 95. I sent our Ambassador, Sam Kaplan, a more detailed note that
explains her itinerary and trip.

I am sure that Lucy would appreciate your informing the Secretary, as would I.

Best wishes.
Stu

Dear Mr. Ambassador/Dear Sam,

I hope you and Sylvia are well. I enjoyed being with you at the NAPEO conference in Marrakech in January, and
more recently being together at CSIS with the Moroccan Foreign Minister.

I am writing about a very exciting project, which can be very beneficial to Morocco and to U.S.-Morocco
relations. I have absolutely no legal or commercial interests in this, but I have such a high degree of confidence
in this project, I wanted to ask if you could help with it.

My friend Lucy Jarvis of New York City, at 95 years of age, is a living legend in the media business. She was an
early pioneer for women in the industry. She has won numerous Emmy awards for her documentaries on
subjects as wide-ranging as the Louvre Museum (she is the only person to have ever been permitted to film
the Louvre), the Kremlin (with President Kennedy's intervention, she became the first person to film the inside
of the Kremlin), and the Forbidden City in Beijing (again as a path breaker). She has been the most prestigious
personal awards the television and film industry can offer.

Lucy wants to do a documentary on Morocco. The theme I suggested when we met last week in New York is
Morocco as a model for the Arab world, following the Arab Spring.

I understand you and Sylvia are attending a dinner in her honor on May 22. But I hope you might take time to
meet with Lucy and her talented associate Scott McArthur, with whom I also met, and to help her think
through the best way to approach this documentary. I am sure it will time well spent for you and Sylvia, for
your Embassy, and for U.S.-Morocco relations.

I am attaching her itinerary, and biography.

Best wishes,

Stu Eizenstat

 On the subject of Morocco, I was heartened to hear that you believe we are on the right track in developing our
 television project about the country. As you are aware, my award-winning films for NBC always strove to °
 bring the people of the world closer by creating a better understanding of the art, culture and citizens of
 different nations. As the first country to recognize the United States, Morocco holds the title of longest standing
 ally to the US and recent developments have made Morocco the model for that part of the world. We are eager
 to present this extraordinary country to audiences worldwide.

 I have attached our itinerary and some background information as you requested. Asma Chaabi (tel:
           has arranged my trip. Scott McArthur, my Associate, and I will be staying at the home of Ra ea
 Alaoui when in Rabat. They have planned an intimate dinner in our honor the evening that I arrive in Rabat on
 May 22nd which Ambassador Kaplan and his wife will be attending.

 As we mentioned, while we are in Morocco, we are attending the annual conference of The International
 Women's Forum, a networking organization of prestigious executive women worldwide.

 I appreciate any contacts that you might make for us that would help us bring the film to fruition. Specifically,
 you mentioned Mostafa Terrab. We are most interested in meeting with him during this trip either in
 Casablanca or Rabat and would be most grateful if you could arrange an introduction.

 Many thanks.

 Sincerely,

  Lucy Jarvis
