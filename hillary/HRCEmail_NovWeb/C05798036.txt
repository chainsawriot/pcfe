President Barack Obama said Friday that he wanted to do a joint interview with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
because he wants the country to appreciate the extraordinary role she has played in his administration.

"Well, the main thing is I just wanted to have a chance to publicly say thank you, because I think Hillary will go down as
one of the finest secretaries of state we've had," he told CBS News' Steve Kroft during the sitdown. "It has been a great
collaboration over the last four years.

"I'm going to miss her, wish she was sticking around but she has logged in so many miles I can't begrudge her wanting to
take it easy for a little bit," he said. "But I want the country to appreciate what an extraordinary role she's played during
the course of my administration. A lot of the successes we've had internationally have been because of her hard work."

While it appeared rather like an endorsement for Clinton's possible political aspirations, possibly a future presidential
run, he did not explicitly say so in the clip broadcast Friday. The rest of the interview is scheduled to air during "60
Minutes" on Sunday.

Clinton said during the interview that she agreed to be secretary of state after losing the Democratic nomination to
Obama because she felt a duty to serve the country.

"One of the things that I say to people, because I think it helps them understand, I say look, in politics and in democracy,
sometimes you win elections and sometimes you lose elections. And I worked very hard but I lost," she said. "And then
President Obama asked me to be secretary of state and I said yes.

 "And why did he ask me and why did I say yes? Because we both love our country."
