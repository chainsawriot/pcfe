Cheryl,

       had a second meeting with Amb. Sussman on Friday, in which the Ambassador told              he feels she is
overqualified for the position he envisions.

According to            Amb. Sussman was extremely complimentary of her, stating she was very well-respected across
the board and everyone he spoke with about her had nothing but wonderful things to say. However, he said he'd be
embarrassed/feel bad about asking her to do 85% of the tasks he envisions for this role (Amb. Sussman's job description
for the position is below, so you can see why he'd say this).

        said they left things on very good terms with the Ambassador stating he wants them to maintain a relationship
and asked her to get back in touch with him in 6 to 7 weeks. He also made a vague, and somewhat odd, reference to
her possibly volunteering or working on a contract basis down the line at the embassy. In addition, he made a call to
nominate her for a position on the                              while she was sitting in his office.

          does not want Amb. Sussman to think that she is at all unhappy with the way she was treated. He seems to put
a lot of thought and deliberation into this decision given how long he has drawn out this process and how many people
he spoke with about her.             agrees that she would probably be overqualified for the position that he envisions,
however, she also feels that he is not using this position to its fullest potential and value.

Right after I got off the phone with      the desk officer for London called to ask who the appropriate person was for
Amb Sussman to contact regarding staffing. I said you - so you will likely get an email from the Ambassador about this
shortly.

I told         I would keep her posted on our end.

Many thanks,
Heather
