This item, which Jim is referencing, was in Kamen (note caps) and see his original email:

Speaking of Lew, his likely job switch sparked an immediate guessing game about a replacement for him at the State
Department. Since President Obama moved to rip him away from his job as one of Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton's
two deputies -- over her intense objections -- the sense we're getting is that she gets her pick of most anyone she wants.
(Okay, maybe not our old colleague Sidney Blumenthal, but just about anyone else.)

Given that assumption, the early speculation was that Clinton would tap Wendy Sherman, former director of Emily's List
and assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs and later counselor to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. She
was a foreign policy adviser to Clinton during the 2008 presidential campaign. She works at the Albright Group.

Sherman's clearly the favorite for the job, but we seem to recall this was the same position she turned down when it
was offered to her the first time around, after the election. She is said to have preferred to be the No. 1 deputy -- the job
now held by Jim Steinberg -- which is more policy-intensive. Or she would have accepted deputy national security
adviser.

But that was then. Now the more management-oriented job might be something of a steppingstone. STEINBERG IS SAID
TO BE MOST UNHAPPY THESE DAYS AND THE CHATTER IS THAT HE AND THE SECRETARY ARE NOT ESPECIALLY CLOSE, so
the betting is he'll move on in the not-too-distant future. At that point, Sherman would be positioned for a policy
portfolio.

Sherman is considered very smart and an extremely hard worker, though some say she can be abrasive. Still, she's
probably one of the few people in Hillaryland who haven't gotten a Foggy Bottom job yet.
