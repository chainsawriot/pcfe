As for the other Arabs,                  concerned about the spoilers, not the moderates, especially Syria. In our approach
to them, he advises us to avoid being negative; we should indicate that their constructive behavior at Sirte will be seen
by us as a positive sign of their intentions toward us and comp peace.

He did not know which heads were coming, but said neither Kings Abdullah would go.

Abdullah is not going, incidentally. Can NEA do a check through embassies on who is expected?; low turnout is
advantageous, unless the extremists predominate among those who do go                                                             B5

Both Mubarak and Abdullah are strongly supportive of our current, short term approach. Mubarak sees Abbas Tues and
will advise him to maintain in public and at Sine that he is ready for direct talks in the right circumstances, and Egypt will
support him. Abdullah of same mind, but focused on making sure Abbas makes the right presentation. Abbas was pulling
up to compound as we were pulling out. I plan to get readout                                      said the task at Sine would  1.4(D)
