We were deeply saddened to learn of the passing of our friend George McGovern. The world has lost a tireless advocate
for human rights and dignity.

We first met George while campaigning for him in 1972. Our friendship endured for 40 years. As a war hero,
distinguished professor, Congressman, Senator and Ambassador, George always worked to advance the common good
and help others realize their potential. Of all his passions, he was most committed to feeding the hungry, at home and
around the world. The programs he created helped feed millions of people, including food stamps in the 1960s and the
international school feeding program in the 90's, both of which he co-sponsored with Senator Bob Dole.

In 2000, Bill had the honor of awarding him the Medal of Freedom. From his earliest days in Mitchell to his final days in
Sioux Falls, he never stopped standing up and speaking out for the causes he believed in. We must continue to draw
inspiration from his example and build the world he fought for. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and
friends.
