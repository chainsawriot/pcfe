  Different people are characterizing this in different ways. Bottom line - they endorsed the continuation of the parades
  process outlined in Hillsborough; said jury was still out on the substance.

  Order welcomes parades progress
  The Orange Order gives work being done on parading by a DUP and Sinn Fein working group a qualified welcome.
  A Grand Lodge meeting voted in favour of a resolution welcoming "the progress being made" on the new bill.
  Grand Master Robert Saulters said they still had concerns about a campaign "restricting freedom of assembly".
  He said the Order still wanted the Parades Commission abolished but would hold back on making a final comment until
  the draft bill is published.
  "From here we will wait for the actual bill to be printed, and then we will be part of the team that will be concerned
  about questions on that," he said.
  He said that 95% of the 120 members at the policy meeting at the meeting on the issue in County Tyrone voted to give
  the working group the space to continue working on the legislation. However, it will not be in place for this year's
  marching season.
  TUV leader Jim Allister said he believed the Order was "was right not to give the DUP a blank cheque" and added that he
  hoped "it does not have occasion to regret its down payment of trust in the DUP/Sinn Fein deal".
  It is understood the Order met with senior DUP figures on Thursday.
  Jeffrey Donaldson, Stephen Moutray and Nelson McCausland and Reverend Mervyn Gibson are believed to have
  attended.
  Mr Gibson has been advising the new joint working group on parades set up following the Hillsborough Agreement.
  Last month, the Orange Order said it had several areas of concern about the working group's proposals.
  The DUP and Sinn Fein set up a six-strong group to review parading following the Hillsborough Agreement.
  That working group delivered its report to the office of the first and deputy first minister on 24 February.
  The document is not due to be made public, which has concerned the loyal orders and residents' groups who oppose
  certain marches.

The remit of the DUP/Sinn Fein parades working group was to agree a framework for dealing with what is a particularly
controversial issue in Northern Ireland.
Three DUP members and three Sinn Fein members were tasked with designing a new and improved framework to rule
on controversial marches, including a focus on local solutions, mediation and adjudication.
Nationalist residents in mainly working-class areas such as north Belfast and Portadown in County Armagh oppose
Orange Order processions in their areas because they view them as triumphalist.
Members of the loyal orders accuse residents of going out of their way to be offended and maintain it is their traditional
right to demonstrate on the streets.

Empey just told me the Orange Order did NOT vote for it but took a wait and see

attitude. Can you confirm what happened?

Re: NI latest




1.     Shaun got former President George W. Bush to call Cameron yesterday

through Paula Dobriansky, the former special envoy. The report back: Bush

delivered the message, he told Cameron he considered it important for Cameron to

get the UUP to complete the peace conference. Cameron said he was in favor.

2.     This morning the Orange Order that organizes Protestant parades voted to

recommend acceptance of the recent Hillsborough Castle agreement on future

parades by an overwhelming margin, 100-5. Rather than standing outside the

parading commission, this vote is a sign of confidence by Unionism in the new

agreement.

3.     All evidence is that the UUP is trying to make Peter Robinson's life

impossible. On Thursday, March 4, Empey finally produced a document laying out


       UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768108 Date: 11/30/2015
      UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768108 Date: 11/30/2015




the UUP position. Among its demands was one for reorganization of the executive,

conceived to undermine the process. Robinson and McGuinness, in fact, have

already asked Empey to head a commission to make recommendations on making the

executive work better. Robinson has told Shaun he is prepared to help Empey on

the education issue, but not if he is unwilling to help on the peace process.

Empey is also making a demand about who can be the justice minister that Shaun

characterizes as "insane." The DUP and Sinn Fein have already created a process

not to nominate someone from their respective parties to be justice minister to

avoid putting in the post whose past is incendiary from Sinn Fein. Empey's

demand to return to the old process is intended as merely a wrecking device.

4.   Shaun is having done a poll of NI public opinion that, if it comes out

well, will be released to the press by Monday. Robinson has shared his private

polling with Shaun that shows more than 86 percent of the NI public support the

agreement.

5.   It is unclear what is going on with Cameron. Is he actually pushing for

the agreement or not? If he is, does he have any influence? Either Cameron is

purposefullly not being strong with Empey or he is being spurned, making calls.

If he is not really pressuring Empey, it would be out of a desperate and vain

attempt to grab a parliamentary seat in the case of a hung parliament—a seat

that is out of his grasp—the Sylvia Hermon seat.

6.   Robinson has previously declared he would resign if the UUP didn't

endorse the agreement. But Shaun says that he's getting signs that Robinson may

be moving away from that position. There is a prospect that Empey's failure to

endorse might not produce meltdown. If so, that would toll the end of the UUP.

Having tried to wreck the agreement, they would be left stranded. If Robinson

stood firm then, didn't resign, triggering new elections, he might well achieve

the isolation of the UUP.
