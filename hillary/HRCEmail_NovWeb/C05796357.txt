Madame Secretary

I am in Siem Reap now but Tim Regan called me about the passing of Amo's wife, Priscilla. I asked him for the address
and numbers in case you wanted to send a note or call.

Added Robert, Claire and Monica.

Kris,

Thanks for taking my call today. I'm attaching a copy of the obituary for Priscilla Houghton.
She passed away last Friday, July 9, 2012.

      UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05796357 Date: 11/30/2015




The memorial service will be held this Saturday at Trinity Episcopal Church at 2:00pm on July 14, 2012,
located at 206 Clarendon Street, Copley Square, Boston, MA 02116.

With respect to              call to the Secretary, do you think he should just place a call to Claire Coleman at   B6
202-647-7098? This way he can be placed on her call list and she can return the call at her convenience. Or, I
can just call her myself. In any event, she will need input from you.

Please let me know how to proceed with this.

Thanks,

Tim
