:-( I knew you would say that!
But of course I asked first - so I won't.
So here is what I was going to write:
1. She is a hard worker - and people appreciate hard work.
2. She is fact-driven - and people appreciate someone who sticks to the facts.
3. She is sensitive to the perspective of others - she doesn't impugn motives and respects the interests of others - as was
said about Atticus Finch in "To Kill A Mockingbird": "she can walk in other people's shoes and see the world through
their eyes."
4. She is a gracious person - the most important quality for a successful diplomat.

So now you are the only reader of these words! (Unless you change your mind).

So proud of you, Hillary - when President Clinton and I talked about my PBS column (I think I mentioned he called me,
which was a great thing!), we both reflected on how great a Secretary of State - and person - you are.

I'm afraid anything you write will be suspect in light of our long relationship!

Hi H--
So why am I not surprised?
Am writing about the reasons why this is so in Purple Nation column -- ok? I won't embarrass you or make comparisons
to others, promise.
