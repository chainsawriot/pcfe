David,
Secretary Clinton relayed your note and we are very glad to work with your team. Ambassador Princeton Lyman is
headed to Addis in another day to participate in the talks and am sure he will be glad to continue working together with
AGI. Will be in touch to make sure we make all of the connections.
Best,
Wendy

Dear Hillary:

Our offices are in touch for us to meet on October 3rd. The Convention next week won't be the same without you.

I just wanted to touch base about South Sudan. As I wrote before I am doing a little bit of work there. I am mentoring
staff of Tony's charity (Africa Governance Initiative, which works to help African governments organise themselves) who
are based in the Presidential office in Juba. I visited in May and will go back.

There is a mountain to climb but I met the Juba based staff member last
week your visit was clearly positive. You made things happen and
showed them sufficient understanding to make them think straight(er).

 The US like AGI see high priority in getting the Office of the President to function better, set priorities, focus on delivery
 etc. Now there is a chance of oil revenue flowing we are keen to get the government focussing on its core tasks of
 development. It would be enormously helpful if your people in Juba could work closely with the AGI on this.

(USAID in other places are very supportive of AGI work).


If you can give this a push that would be great.


Many thanks.
