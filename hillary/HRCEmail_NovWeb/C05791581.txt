Cheryl,

I am writing to report that we (A&P and Yale) have been discussing your proposal.

Also, I have spoken with Gary Stern and Nancy Smith at the National Archives. I told them that State has been working
this issue hard and that we are considering something with you that might work.

I gave them NO details of your proposal. I did NOT mention you by name or position. I did say that Dr. Kissinger and
Yale were interested in finding a solution that would lead to the declassification of the entire collection and not just the
documents that are the responsibility of State. They will give some thought as to how such a solution might be
structured and will get back to me.

I am sure you appreciate that if we're going to raise private funds for the declassification effort, we'll need to have
confidence that the entire collection will be declassified.

I apologize for the delay in getting back to you, but I want to keep you posted on our efforts.

Again, many thanks to you and Pat for your efforts. I hope you will both get some time off in August.

Jeff

Cheryl,

Many thanks to you and Pat for your efforts. I spoke with Dr. Kissinger yesterday and he is most interested to learn the
details of your proposal.

I'll discuss this with him and with Ted, as Yale has a major interest in this.

HAK is traveling for the next few days, but we'll get back to you as soon as possible.

Again, many thanks for taking this on - the Department has more than a full plate and I am personally very grateful for
your attention.

All the best,

Jeff

Importance: High

Dear Jeff

I am following up on our conversation on Sunday. I am copying Ted to whom I had first raised this potential approach on
a call two weeks ago.

Please find below the draft of the proposed approach I received.

After reviewing it and discussing as you deem appropriate internally, I would welcome a discussion regarding: 1)
whether to proceed; 2) the mechanism for the coverage of these expenses consistent with our regulations and
guidelines; 3) timeline for proceeding and 4) assurances that this satisfies the issues that have been raised by HAK
regarding his historical materials.

H/W revised paper that addresses your questions

Regards

pat


The following is a three phase approach to reviewing the "Kissinger" papers that are currently at the
Library of Congress (LOC). Estimated costs below based on what we understand is a collection of
approximately 250,000 pages of State Department documents. If the volume is higher or lower, the
estimated costs would adjust accordingly.

With respect to the protocols outlined below, Department officials would bring the actual documents
from the LoC collection to the Department for Phases 2 and 3 to ensure the primary source collection
at the LoC properly is tagged with classification/declassification markings (thus, we would not review
materials on online on the RAC because that process would not permit tagging of documents as
they were identified).


          Phase 1: Collection Assessment: $75K
             • Initial assessment and identification of unique State records (those records that
                potentially are not part of State record collection at NARA)
             • 882 effort hours @$85/hour (average rate for regular/senior reviewer contract costs)
             • Copying costs for the unique State records (to compare with/supplement the State
                record collection at NARA): TBD

          Phase 2: Administrative Processing: $113K
             • Boxing, inventorying, transporting, and listing the entire collection of State documents
                (to record review decisions)
             • 3,530 effort hours @ $32/hour (estimated rate for contractor support services)

          Phase 3: Document Review: $4.56M
             • Review and mark (with declassification stamp, as appropriate) the entire collection
                (estimated 250,000 pages) including any hand-written annotations
             • 53,650 effort hours - including interagency coordination - @$85/hr

          TOTAL COST: $4.75M

It is important to note that this review would be done in accordance with the Department's standard
practice for historical records, which is to declassify a document in full or withhold it in full. To redact
portions of a document would require a much more time-consuming, labor-intensive and expensive
review such as we did for the telephone "transcripts." (Note: In a rough order of magnitude, based
on the actual costs of that exercise, it could cost over $13M to complete a review involving
redactions of the LoC material from HAK's tenure as SecState.)
