Cheryl, I really enjoyed seeing you today. I thought it was a successful morning due in large part to your presence and
leadership in these issues. And Raj did a great job as well. So did Rosa and Doug.

I am always willing and able to help you and the Secretary in any way possible. We are making monumental strides in
this area.

Dan
