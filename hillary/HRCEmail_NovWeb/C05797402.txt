Subject: thoughts for the Secretary

Cheryl: My thoughts and prayers have been unceasing in the hopes of a quick recovery for the Secretary. She is so
important for our country, and her good health is all I could hope for in 2013. Could I impose on you and ask you to
share with her that we are thinking of her? Thank you a million for everything. Best, Daniel
