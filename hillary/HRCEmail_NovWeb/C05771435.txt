The bill would most likely have had a different outcome if you had still been in the Senate. Oh well, we need you
desperately where you are, tired but not downtrodden. Rahm is being challenged on his residency. Law state he is
supposed to have lived in Chicago one year prior to the election. Interesting wrinkle. As you know, we loved having
Lilly here and feel her pain even more intensely with this latest defeat.
                               Very cold today. How is Lisbon? Always loved that city when I lived in Madrid. In 1968 it
felt some 20 years behind Madrid--sort of Milwaukee to Chicago.                                          By the way,
loved your Australian (I think?) interview. Safe travels. Love you, Nancy

Regrettable all the way around.

Senate Republicans Filibuster Fair Pay For Women

Matt Finkelstein

The first bill President Obama signed after taking office was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act

Collins (R-ME), Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) and Olympia Snowe (R-ME) joined

Il_vote_cfm.cfm%3Fcongress%3D111%26session%3D1%26vote%3D00014> with Democrats to overcome strong
Republican opposition to the bill.

But today, all three Republican senators voted against a motion to proceed on the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill that
"would further strengthen current laws

votes short of the 60 needed for the bill to be considered on the Senate floor.

This is not the first time the Paycheck Fairness Act has stalled in the Senate. In 2008, the upper chamber failed to vote
on the bill after it was approved by the House, which passed the legislation again in 2009 with the support of 10
Republicans <http://politicalcorrection.org/rd?to=http%3A%2F%2Fclerk.house.gov%2Fevs%2F2009%2Fro11008.xml> .

Women earn barely three-quarters of what their male counterparts make
<http://politicalcorrection.org/rd?to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pay-equity.org%2FPDFs%2FPFA-FactSheet-2010.pdf> for
the same work, but conservatives have invented a number of ludicrous reasons for opposing equal pay legislation. For
example, the Heritage Foundation has suggested that equal pay laws actually hurt women

them fair wages. And Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) has claimed that women would receive better compensation if they just
had more "education and training
