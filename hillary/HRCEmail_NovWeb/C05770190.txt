                    had good meetings with UN and SG last week.



                                                        ensuring Uribe has a veto on all procedural and substantive
matters and that this is not a separate investigation but a panel to "receive and review" the two national reports and
make recs on how to avoid such incidents in future.

     made his points strongly t      re: panel "of inquiry" and "affected states" but these remain and will not be
removed.
               I sense       realizes this is the best text they can get and these points are not core.




                                                                                                         The ball is
 now in Israel's court.    has asked Israel for an answer tomorrow. The Seven ministers are meeting at 10am local to
 decide.

 Tomorrow we should know where we are. Indeed, we could have the panel's establishment announced by Ban               1.4(B)
                                                                                                                      1.4(D)
 tomorrow, if no curve-balls.
                                                                                                                      B1

 I am meeting with        today at his request. My understanding is he wants to discuss the proposed UN Panel on the B1
 Gaza flotilla. We have continued to work closely with                   as they negotiate with the UN on the terms of
 reference and method of work (Brooke will send the latest draft texts separately).

                                                                            the biggest being the name of the panel
 (whether it is called "panel of inquiry" or the word "inquiry" is dropped as       insists).




 Will continue to keep you posted.

 Best,

 Susan
