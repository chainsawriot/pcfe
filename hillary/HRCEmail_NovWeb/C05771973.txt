Subject:                           Additional items



Between the time I saw you and when my flight took off, I had the phone stapled to my ear. See items below, some of
which are elliptically written:

1.                                                                                                                 We've       B5
decided to go the public route to reassure American companies, rather than a private letter, and it looks like we'll pull it
off. If we get one remaining half sentence resolved, we'll have a solid statement.

2. Bill B. thinks the UNSC reform piece of the speech to parliament is in a reasonable place. He is working with Derek on
a rollout plan, which essentially casts the statement in India as stating the obvious and makes clear that we don't think
there will be any imminent changes to the council.

3. We still don't have time or venue with the P5+1
Bill's Russian counterpart is going to Tehran and will press on time/venue.




5. Feltman is going to send a Yemen strategy up this weekend, so we have a stronger and more focused civilian
complement to the CT stuff.




7. We are trying to get more info on the Egyptian proposal for us to mediate a framework agreement.

8. Sheba and I have worked through the whole chapter. It'll get another once-over from Meghann Curtis, then come
back around for a final cleanup. I think it's on its way. The national security budget material will be folded into the
conclusion.

9. My cabbie was positively glowing about your visit. Grizzled old guy; totally blown away.

10. Les Gelb read your speech at my prompting. He told me it was spot on. He's not a bs'er. I told him to fix his blog
post. He has a foreign affairs piece on economics and foreign policy that you should read - we need to put on a speech
for you on the subject in the early part of next year.

11. I think it makes sense to do a follow-up with Kurt when we're back, because there are a number of items we need to
drive.

12. I've sent along the note from Dennis            to the plane team. Let me know if you don't get it.
