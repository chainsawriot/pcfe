Subject: howard stringer

thought i'd share remarks made today by my (soon to be moving) boss here, Sir Howard Stringer, at a
conference in Japan where he called for greater inclusion of women and young people in the business culture
there (you'll find a couple quotes from the Secretary herein).

Japan, unfortunately, has one of the worst records in Asia in terms of women in senior positions in business
(only one percent of seats on boards of directors of the top 100 companies are held by women, for
example). But that is beginning to change, at least in terms of the willingness of people to talk about the
subject.
