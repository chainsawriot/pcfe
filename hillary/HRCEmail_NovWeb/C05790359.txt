Subject:                          Statement




This is what we're proposing to put out in your name. We've crafted the statement in a way that doesn't pronounce
definitively on what happened but is strong and tough. Can you take a look? (Sorry for the caps)

The United States condemns
in the strongest possible terms yesterday's massacre in the Syrian village of Haoula. United Nations observers have
confirmed that dozens of men, women, and children were killed and hundreds more wounded in a vicious assault that
involved a REGIME artillery and tank barrage on a residential neighborhood.

The world will spare no effort to IDENTIFY AND HOLD accountABLE THOSE who perpetrated this atrocity. And the
UNITED STATES will WORK WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO intensify our pressure on Asad and his cronies,
whose rule by murder and fear must come to an end.

WE stand in solidarity with the Syrian people and the peaceful marchers in cities across Syria who have taken to the
streets to denounce the massacre in Haoula.
