   LIMASSOL, CYPRUS (AP) - A Swedish-Lebanese man has pleaded not guilty to charges he
was planning an attack against Israeli citizens on the eastern Mediterranean island of Cyprus.
   The eight charges read out in a Limassol court on Friday against 24-year-old Hossam Taleb
Yaacoub include conspiracy and consent to commit a criminal offense and participation in a
criminal organization by "carrying out missions in any part of the world, including the Cyprus
Republic, against Israeli citizens."
   Yaacoub originally faced 17 "terrorism and terrorism-related" charges according to police,
but prosecutors last month dropped terrorism from the new charges.
   Israel's prime minister has said that Yaacoub was a Hezbollah operative who used the same
"modus operandi" as a suicide bomber who killed five Israeli tourists and a Bulgarian bus driver
in Burgas, Bulgaria, in July.
