   I just met with Hoang Chi Trung, who is the Director General of International Organizations in the Foreign Ministry here
    He is my counter-part in the human rights dialogue.

   I went through the list of items that I raised in my letter to him after last November's dialogue and that were outlined
   in the Human Rights Roadmap ( non-paper)the Embassy prepared and submitted to the government in March.
                                                                                                                              1.4(B)
                                                                                                                              1.4(D)
