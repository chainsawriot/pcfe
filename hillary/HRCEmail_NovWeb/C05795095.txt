Good Morning Everyone. Or as they say here in Israel, 'Boker Tov'

Today's a special day, not simply because the trip is almost over, but because some of us are at home among our people.
In honor of that, Pam has graciously allowed me to collaborate on today's daily missive. But don't worry, by popular
demand she will resume the practice starting tomorrow - even though we'll be in Washington.

Today's isn't a quote per se, and it isn't anyone famous. These traditional questions have been asked by Jewish children
for millenia. They don't necessarily have answers tough, they are merely meant to encourage children to be inquisitive.

But I am attributing the below to one very special Jewish child who I know will go on to practice and further our rich
traditions:



1) Ma nishtana ha-la ila ha-zeh mi-kol ha-lelot?
[Why is this stop different from all other stops?]



2) She-be-chol ha-lelot anu ochlin chametz u-matza, ha-laila ha-zeh kulo matza?
[Why is it that on all other nights during the year we eat well-balanced, nutritional meals with vegetables, but on this
trip we eat 5000 calorie meals mixing meats and cheeses and sauces that shouldn't be combined?]

3) She-be-chol ha-lelot en anu matbilin afilu pa'am echat, ha-laila ha-zeh shetay fe'amim?
[Why is it on all other nights we do not eat ice cream dipped and fried even once, but on this trip we eat ice cream that
has been dipped in artery clogging batter twice?]



4) She-be-chol ha-lelot anu ochlin bayn yoshvin u-vayn mseubin, ha-laila ha-zeh kelanu mesubin?
[Why is it that on all other nights we eat either sitting or reclining, but on this trip we are admonished to eat in strapped
to our seats in because we are within 200 minutes of landing?]



- Jordan Zane (Abedin) Weiner, at his first seder.

We can, however, seek happiness in rest, which is coming.
