Cheryl, I hope you and your family have a wonderful 2013. Thanks to you and Secretary Clinton, my 2012 was fulsome
and rewarding.

Please extend my family's warmest wishes for a full and speedy recovery to the Secretary, with our gratitude for her
exemplary service.

I look forward to getting together with you in the coming days to catch up and to let you know that we are making real
progress.

Best always, Rick
