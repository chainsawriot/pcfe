First, great to hear your voice and your message yesterday, Hillary. You're joining us by phone was much appreciated by
all, especially cuz you sounded so glad to be sprung & back in action. As per Jake's heads-up, I'd like a few minutes on
the phone to summarize a proposal, in hopes that you might find it plausible enough to discuss in person. If that's ok, let
me know when I might reach out via the OpsCenter - or those worthies can track me down. They're good at that. Cheers,
Strobe
