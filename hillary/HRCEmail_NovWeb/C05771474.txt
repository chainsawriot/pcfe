 Spoke to Cameron this morming and told him we are all on the same page. Also told him we are trying to move this
 forward as quickly as possible. As you will see below he agrees with me that the simplest solution would be to use the
 flag which he feels is immediately recognizable.

 Mark,




  Who can give me a brief summary of the particular marking strategies of each of the grantees?

Now that I'm a seasoned veteran (in Islamabad for a month) I'd like to see an American flag on every item/project.
Nothing else. Just the flag. Every Pakistani with whom I've spoken has told me that fancier logos, including the USAID
logo, dilute the clarity of the marking, contributing to the overwhelming message I've received all over the country:"
America announces repeatedly its billions in assistance. We see none of it. Therefore it's going directly into the coffers
of corrupt Pakistanis." Or worse: a cabinet minister told me two days ago that "KLB money is being taken from the
Pakistani people to build a new embassy compound in Islamabad."




I know these are simply impressions, and wrong ones; and we'll work to correct them. But I'd like to know what the
grantees plan.




Thanks,




Cameron

Hello again. Quick update (very busy with cholera in Haiti). Only 2 grantees still discussing marking strategy with us:
CARE and Oxfam, the two that formally appealed my earlier decision. We will not let discussions go on forever. If we
don't see closure soon, we will terminate their grants. 9 other out of original 11 are now in compliance. Thanks for your
support. Mark

Subject: Update on marking strategy for USAID grantees in Pakistan

Quick note to update you on our discusssions with the 11 USAID grantees who joined InterAction's letter proposing an
alternative marking strategy for Pakistan.




As you know, we denied InterAction's proposal -- and told the 11 grantees that we would discuss their particular
marking strategies with each of them separately.




7 of the 11 grantees now have compliant marking strategies. Discussions with 4 grantees continue, but we are hopeful
that all will agree to a compliant strategy.




Thanks for your support. Mark
