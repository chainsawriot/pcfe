Truly terrific today, Hillary. Any number of people there, including ambos, said it was far and away the best,
most comprehensive, most constructively targeted Euro-message they've heard from the Administration (I
guess politesse suggests I add: since your last speech on the subject). Naturally, it's a source of institutional
gratification (as well as personal gratitude on my part) that you'd choose Brookings as the venue. I hate like
hell that I'm missing you at the Saban dinner tomorrow night, but I promise to advance your agenda within the
secret and omnipotent councils of the Trilateral Commission. Cheers, S.
