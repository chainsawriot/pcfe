Subject: Blind activist Chen says is at Beijing airport (Reuters)

BEIJING (Reuters) - Blind Chinese legal activist Chen Guangcheng said on Saturday he has left a hospital in
Beijing and was waiting at the airport.

   Chen told Reuters by telephone: "I'm at the airport now. I've already left the hospital. But there are many
things that are still unclear."

    Chen said that his wife and two children were at the airport with him, accompanied by hospital staff.

   "Yes, I might be heading for a flight to the United States, but I haven't been told, and I haven't received our
passports, so I'm not sure yet," Chen said. "We're waiting to find out what's happening."
