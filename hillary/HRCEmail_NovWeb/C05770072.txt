Madam Secretary, I wonder about                  and             for the position you mentioned. I would add them to the   B6
list that includes                        especially. He used to be in PM, meaning he has good relations with the
military. I don't know                 personally, but everyone says she's very good. She's going to            assuming
confirmation), but surely one can find an appropriate candidate for             more easily than the post you're

from that, I'd put               'II keep thinking.
