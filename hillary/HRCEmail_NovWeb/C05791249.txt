Subject: Egyptian Court permits Shafiq candidacy, voids some parliamentary seats (SBU)

(SBU) Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court ruled the country's law barring former Mubarak officials from
running for office was unconstitutional, media report. The ruling clears the way for former PM Ahmed Shafiq's
presidential candidacy. The court also declared some parliamentary election rules unconstitutional, apparently
voiding the elections of at least one-third of the members of the lower house of parliament.
