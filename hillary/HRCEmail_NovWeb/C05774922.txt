Neera---Thx for the updates.




I would welcome the chance to speak at CAP again--I did once last year but it's time to use it as a venue for a big speech
again. I'll see what we can plan. Do you have any ideas?

I'll check on               Hope you and the family are will--Happy Summer! H

I know world events are pressing in, but thought I'd send an update on the health care story, which I promised to do, .




I spent a lot of times with Robert Pear about 10 days ago and then checked back in with him a couple of days ago. I gave
him everything off the record, with the understanding that he wbuld report out this story in his own voice. I gave him
the FEHBP story, in addition to al! of the policies in the bill that were in your campaign plan (and that weren't in the
Obama campaign plan). He was very interested; in our conversation last week, he indicated that his own reporting
preliminarily indicated that the FEHBP idea didn't originate on the Hill. He has a fair amount more work to do on the
story, but he seems pretty excited about it, or as excited as Robert gets.




Also, I meant to teii you this on the phone last week, but understand                 may be up for an important job at
State. I don't know much of anything about it, and the job may have been iilied by. now, but he was very helpful to the
campaign, so ! thought I'd send that aiong.

Finally, I have to put,a pitch in for you to speak at CAP. I know John has talked to Cheryl about this a few times, so I
don't mean this as overkill, but as Secretary of State you've been to Brookings for a few events, arid it would be great if
you could do a speech at CAP. We are pretty good at driving press coverage for our events, though of course, you hardly
need that assurance.




Hope you had time to rest over Memorial Day weekend, before the crush of events.




Neera
