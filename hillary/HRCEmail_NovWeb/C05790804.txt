Pelosi: Clinton 'our shot' in 2016
By ALEXANDER BURNS I

6/3/12 12:26 PM EDT

Nancy Pelosi, who touched off a new wave of Hillary Clinton-for-president buzz two months ago by talking up
the secretary of state as a 2016 candidate, keeps it up in an interview with the Chronicle's Carla Marinucci:

Pelosi is upbeat about the prospects for a female president in her lifetime, namely her friend Hillary Rodham
Clinton.

"Why wouldn't she run? She's a magnificent secretary of state," Pelosi said when asked about Clinton's
prospects in 2016. "She's our shot" that year, Pelosi said.

You should read the whole interview, which includes Pelosi's thoughts on the need to keep selling health care
reform and her winning-is-everything view of the House in 2012.
