appreciate your confidence in me in this job, and will gladly remain in it. My conviction is that     -hould go to ECA
with a PDAS in place, and believe that even an Acting PDAS is necessary now to help prepare for her first days and
weeks. I have some names to offer. Above all else, my first responsibility is to the Secretary and you and this office. I
have one of the best jobs in town, and about everything I am always optimistic.

Joe
