Subject: Departure of Thein Sein

All: Saw off Thein Sein and delegation last night at JFK Airport. He appeared tired but in a good mood and quite pleased
with his visit. We spent time in the lounge discussing his meetings -- w/frmr Pres Clinton, Henry Kissinger, George Soros,
Burmese-American community, and of course S -- his successful UNGA address (which has gotten good notices even
from some harder NGO hum rts types), and his side trips to Met Museum of Art and NY Public Library. As well as golf,
soccer, the US elections, etc

IS commented appreciatively on S's relaxed and friendly approach to their meeting, and one minister stated that the
meeting couldn't have gone better from their standpoint.
