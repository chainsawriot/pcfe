I have forwarded readouts of Sherman/Gordon-Sinirlioglu and Ricciardone-Cevik calls, which preview what you will hear

Madam Secretary,
Many conversations this morning on the shoot down of Turkish reconnaissance plane, including call Phil and I did with
U/S Sinirlioglu and several by Frank. Phil is doing a call sheet for you for your call with FM Davatoglu this afternoon.
Most concerning is no doubt Turkey plans action, including first step by invoking Article IV for NATO consultations on
Monday though deliberative about what and when beyond that, and not/not seeking NATO action at this point. More to
come in EUR call sheet. Any or all of us available should you wish pre-brief.
Wendy
