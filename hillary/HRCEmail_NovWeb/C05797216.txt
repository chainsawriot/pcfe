(SBU) Philippines Initiates Arbitration Against China On South China Sea (SCS)
Claims: Following procedures in the Law of the Sea Convention, the Philippines notified China
that it will challenge China's "9 dash line" claims in the SCS. China has 30 days to reply to the
Philippines notification. China claims "indisputable sovereignty" over the islands and adjacent
waters in the SCS and sovereign rights over the "relevant waters" and seabed but has never
clarified the scope of its claims. The dispute settlement procedures in the Convention do not
apply to disputes over territory or to boundaries; Philippines is casting its case as interference
with its maritime rights, including in its own exclusive economic zone, which is subject to
dispute settlement under the Convention. China has not yet commented and

(U) UN Forum on Forests Discusses Finance in Run-up to High Level Session: An ad hoc
expert group on forest finance of the UN Forum on Forests (UNFF) met in Vienna January 14-
18, taking up the longstanding UN debate on how to mobilize financial support for
conservation and sustainable management of the world's forests. The G77 appears poised to
demand a new voluntary global forest fund, although there are no signs of a donor able or
willing to commit funding. The United States, the EU, and other donor countries remain
opposed, preferring to strengthen existing mechanisms; improve enabling conditions; and
broaden the focus to include private investment, ecosystem services, and linkages to other
sectors. The meeting of the experts group was the last intersessional meeting before the 10th
session of UNFF (Istanbul, April 8-19), where forest finance will be a priority topic in addition
to "Forests and Economic Development" and the role of forests in the UN post-2015
development agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. The latter topics will likely be
the focus of a UNFF10 ministerial segment April 8-10, which will be hosted by the President of
Turkey. (CBarber and CKarr-Colque, OES/ECW)
