The tribute tonight brought tears to my eyes - what a wonderful memento and celebration of your four years. You
should absolutely show it to Bill! And I couldn't help noticing the celebration of you as a mother and the value of your
experience as a mother that you brought to your job. We need much more of that. Your speech was powerful; I'm very
glad I could be here to hear it. And great to catch a glimpse of you yesterday; your speech made me very proud.
All best,
AM
