Initial word is that he just wants to check in re planning and next steps -- events since last FOSP, coordination of bilateral
assistance, messaging on Aleppo, and next steps diplomatically at UN and post-Annan. But I'll get agenda shortly.

Sounds right to me. Another possibility is to discuss the set of FOSP options. What we are working toward: FOSP Core
Group senior officials meeting (not ministerial level) in Rome to discuss sharing responsibilities for Day After work; FOSP
Ministerial in Morocco or NY (UNGA), depending on timing.

Agenda for FOSP: discussion of Opposition Follow-up Committee work to socialize Transition Plan inside Syria; discussion
of Day After planning, sharing of responsibilities.
