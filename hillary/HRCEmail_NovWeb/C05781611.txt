Thanks for setting up all the meetings: good conversation with Maggie, good meetings with Tom N. and Jake S. All
positive vibes. I am most willing to endure the process—knowing it could be protracted—but I think it would lead to a
good outcome for all. Truly inspired.

I am at USIP most of August and then off—on unpaid leave- starting in Sept. but around, in town, and willing to keep
going down the road with you.

Best.
