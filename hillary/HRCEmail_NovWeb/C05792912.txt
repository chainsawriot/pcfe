Subject: Egypt president orders defense minister retirement (AP)

 CAIRO - (AP) A spokesman says Egypt's president has ordered the defense minister and chief of staff to retire
and has canceled the military-declared constitutional amendments that gave top generals wide powers.
   President Mohammed Morsi also appointed a senior judge, Mahmoud Mekki, as vice president.
   The decisions announced Sunday are effective immediately. Spokesman Yasser Ali said in a news conference
aired on state TV that Morsi appointed a new defense minister, Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi.
   He replaces Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, who headed the military council that ruled Egypt for 17 months
after Hosni Mubarak's ouster in February 2011. Tantawi was defense minister for nearly two decades under
Mubarak.
   The military council's No. 2, Chief of Staff Sami Annan, was also ordered to retire.
