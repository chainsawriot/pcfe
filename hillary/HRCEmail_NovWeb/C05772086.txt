Subject: Thank You

Cheryl,

I received word from the White House, over the holiday, that I have been appointed Alternate Observer to the
International Fund for Ireland with Dan Hynes of Chicago as Observer. I want to convey my sincerest thanks to
you for your help in shepherding my nomination through the White House and ask you to thank Secretary
Clinton for me. Secretary Clinton has always been an ardent supporter of the Fund and I doubt it would have
survived without her advocacy. I am very excited about my appointment and look forward greatly to working
with Mr. Hynes to promote prosperity on my native beleaguered island.

With renewed thanks.

Stella
