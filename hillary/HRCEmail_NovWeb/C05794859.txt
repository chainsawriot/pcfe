Thank you. Caroline also forwarded the message. We had invited the current Chief, Ambassador Yoon and he accepted.
But the former, Ambassador Parker. I neglected to do so. He is terrific! We sent out invite on Friday.

The UN protocol people feel very aggrieved at not being invited to your conference and hit me up at Rio so I told them it
was an oversight. So please invite the UN protocol chief. Thanks.
