Dear Hillary:

Our offices are in touch for us to meet on October 3rd. The Convention next week won't be the same without you.

I just wanted to touch base about South Sudan. As I wrote before I am doing a little bit of work there. I am mentoring
staff of Tony's charity (Africa Governance Initiative, which works to help African governments organise themselves) who
are based in the Presidential office in Juba. I visited in May and will go back.

There is a mountain to climb but I met the Juba based staff member last week your visit was clearly positive. You made
things happen and showed them sufficient understanding to make them think straight(er).

The US like AGI see high priority in getting the Office of the President to function better, set priorities, focus on delivery
etc. Now there is a chance of oil revenue flowing we are keen to get the government focussing on its core tasks of
development. It would be enormously helpful if your people in Juba could work closely with the AGI on this. (USAID in
other places are very supportive of AGI work).

If you can give this a push that would be great.

Many thanks.



David
