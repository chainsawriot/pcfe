Subject: Happy Birthday

Dear Madame Clinton, Dear Hillary,

I wanted to wish you a very happy birthday. I didn't get to say hello in Haiti on Monday because the rain
started and we all rushed to the airport. But it was wonderful to be there again and to witness the progress. And
I was so happy for Cheryl. She's done such an extraordinary and brilliant job, as you know.

It's been a thrill to be so actively engaged in Fulbright. So thank you again for that.



Fondly,

Tom

             Sasha and Emma: The Anarchist Odyssey of Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman
                                     is published by Harvard University Press.

                 Early reviews call the book "magnificent," "definitive," "a sweeping narrative,"
               "a fully human portrait of two tightly linked yet forever fiercely independent spirits."
