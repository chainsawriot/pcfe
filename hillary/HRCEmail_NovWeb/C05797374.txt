Dear Madame Secretary,

I hope you are feeling much better. My heart was heavy as I learned of your health troubles. I am thrilled that
you are out of the hospital.. .and that you will be resting a bit more.

You are precious to your family and friends.., and our nation needs you!

So please rest up!!

Love
Kathleen
