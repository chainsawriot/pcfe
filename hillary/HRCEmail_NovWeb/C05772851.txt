Here's how things look out here.




We have heard some rumors that this may have been successful. i.e., that the Sunni majority of Iraqiyya has been
bought by some other package and will dump allawi (and the Presidency). On the other hand from Ali Debaggah with
Maliki earlier today it sounded like the Turks were encountering hard sledding getting their plan B sold to Maliki.

I will see Allawi and (separately) Issawi and Saleh Mutlaq (!) here tonight, along with Adel Mahdi, and then I will have a
better sense of what is going on. Then will see Maliki (in'shallah) and for sure Barzani tomorrow. We will know better at
least what is in play and where the fault lines are.

All -

Spoke with AMB Jeffrey who asked me to send the following. On the three brackets, no showstoppers -- but our
comments follow:

Most importantly, however, time is of the essence so this is entirely your call. These are just our suggestions.

Many thanks,
