Subject: authorized departure for Algiers

Wendy and Pat,
As we discussed, Amb Ensher has requested authorized departure approval for Embassy Algiers in order to permit the
adult dependents with the small children to depart post. At Amb Ensher's request, I have requested Pat's approval for
authorized departure, which he has given. This will be formalized by cable on Saturday. NEA/EX under Lee Lohman's
leadership is starting to make the necessary arrangements with post.
Beth
