From US Embassy folks




During his press conference with the Tajik President in Kabul, President Karzai covered various issues, including the
dissolution of private security companies. This summary covers only that topic.




President Karzai said that he raised the dissolution of private security companies with the international community
several years ago and thought that they would be able to reach an agreement. Because they failed to do so, the Afghan
Government enacted a four-month deadline for the
dissolution of the private security companies.




President Karzai said the Afghan people were not happy with private security companies because the PSCs enter private
homes with force and act unilaterally without support from Afghan security forces. He said the international community

was supportive of the plan at first and expressed support to the Afghan Government, but now they are exerting pressure
on the Afghan Government - saying they will cut off aid if the dissolution of PSCs goes forward.




President Karzai said that the Afghan Government is ready to provide security for Western development projects and
urged the international community to identify the projects which need PSC support. President Karzai, referencing the
threats by the international community to withdraw aid, said that the international community cannot continue to work
with Afghans if they threaten to cut aid, stop road construction or improvement of the provision of electricity, unless we
(the Afghans) reverse the decision on private security companies.




In addition, President Karzai responded to a question from Tolo TV by saying that the issue of private security companies
is about 1.5 million dollars in money that starts in Washington and ends in Afghanistan. The benefits of private security
companies are going to others, while the damage is being done to Afghanistan. President Karzai added that we don't
know how many of the explosions and bombings that kill Afghans are carried out by the Taliban and how many are
carried out by the private security companies. Until these companies are closed down, we are not able to identify
terrorists. These companies, he said, are parallel governments to the Afghan Government.
