                       Althera's First in Human Studies
                               Press Release 11/7/11

 Major Israeli Institution Selected to Lead Human Clinical Trials for
 Revolutionary Alpha Radiation Cancer Therapy.

Althera Medical Ltd. announced today that it intends to perform a First-in-Human
study for its revolutionary treatment of malignant tumors with alpha radiation at
Israel's eminent Rabin Medical Institute.       Professors Benjamin Corn, M.D.,
Chairman of Radiation Oncology at the Sourasky Medical Center and Althera's
Chief Medical Officer, and Aron Popovtzer, M.D., Chief of the Head and Neck
Tumor Service at Rabin's Beilinson Hospital will lead the study.

Althera's alpha radiation delivery system is expected to offer hope to patients
suffering from head and neck, colon, pancreatic, sarcoma, brain, melanoma and
lung cancer. Althera's Chairman, C. Leonard Gordon, a lawyer and entrepreneur
with previous in-depth experience in successfully bringing medical devices
through the FDA approval process and to market, believes that Althera's
technology could be made available to these patients rapidly under the FDA's
Compassionate Use policy.

Professor Michael J. Zelefsky, Chief of Memorial Sloan Kettering's Brachytherapy
Service, said "the advantages of alpha over beta and gamma radiation are
expected to be shown in these studies. Althera's unique method of alpha
radiation delivery is expected to minimize side effects."

John Brown MD advises that preclinical studies at Tel Aviv University are "Proof of
Principle" that DaRTSTM will work on tumors in the Althera's human clinical
studies. Dr. Brown is currently Head of Global Strategic Drug Development &
Alliances, Quintiles PLC. He has served as Global V.P. and in Experimental and
Translational Medicine areas for SmithKlein Beacham. Dr. Brown has served as an
advisor and a Director of Althera since 2007.

Althera's therapy delivers alpha radiation using tiny needles called DaRTTM
(Diffusing Alpha-emitters Radiation Therapy) invented by Professor Itzhak Kelson
of Tel Aviv University.

 Dr. Steven Evans, CEO of Althera Medical, stated that "alpha radiation has been
 the 'holy grail' of radiation therapy for more than 50 years, but wasn't used
 because it couldn't be delivered. DaRTSTM solv&I this problem. After they are

injected into tumors and begin to generate alpha radiation that diffuses radiation
throughout the tumor, killing cancer cells and shrinking or destroys the tumor."

Althera is now moving to regulatory approval for human use on recurrent head &
neck cancer. The National Cancer Institute estimates that $3.1 billion is spent on
head and neck cancer annually. In addition to head & neck cancer, Althera will
move as soon as possible to treat recurrent head & neck, colon, pancreatic,
sarcoma, brain and lung cancers. These are today's unmet needs that could be
treated soon under the FDA Compassionate Use Policy that is typically approved
for individual patients prior to a regular FDA approval.

The end point of the First-in-Human clinical study is safety, with secondary
endpoints of tumor reduction and relief of pain. The study may require as few as
15 patients and is a prerequisite to larger FDA and European regulatory studies
and Compassionate Use treatments.

 Dr. Evans stated that DaRTSTM will be much less expensive and easier to
 administer than beta or gamma radiation. DaRTSTM do not require heavy
 equipment, specially shielded rooms or lead vests, and the entire dosage can be
 delivered in a single session. Also, Alpha radiation breaks the double strand of
 DNA of the cancer cells, hindering cancer cells from repairing themselves and
 thereby reducing the possibility of radiation-resistance in tumors. Radiation, he
 noted, is a big market that is currently used in about 50% of all tumor therapies.

 The First-in-Human Study is expected to start in a few months if not delayed by
 financing which has been difficult in the face of the recession. It is expected that
 financing will be successful now that there is proof of principal that DaRTSTM do
 work on human tumors and are so close to human clinical studies.

 Althera Medical is an Israeli Company with its headquarters co-located in New
 York City's Harlem and in Tel Aviv. Its Advisory Board contains eminent
 Interventional Radiologists, Brachytherapists and Radiation Oncologists at
