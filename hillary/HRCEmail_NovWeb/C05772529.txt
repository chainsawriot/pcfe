Jake, Joe:

I know this has been briefed before but I thought I should flag for the Secretary's attention the fact that the Saudi arms
package will be formally notified to Congress this Wed, Oct 20.

Andrew Shapiro, along with ASD Sandy Vershbow and others from DOD, will hold an on-the-record briefing of major US
media outlets at 12:30 on Wed, following notification to the Hill. Thereafter he will convey the same announcement in
an interview with Haaretz.

Meant to raise this at 9:15 but did not.

Best,
Kurt
