To avoid the event that they are having at 6pm with Chris Cillizza, she's hoping that you will be available at 7pm for a
drink or dinner before heading to the store OR meet at the store at 7:45pm and then go for dinner or a drink. Otherwise,
the store will be filled with reporters and those waiting to see Cillizza.
