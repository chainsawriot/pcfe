      1. On high side is a detailed lay-out of our views/recommendations for Saturday Washington discussions.
      2. Further info we have picked up so far today:

    - Allawi told                          is is looking closely at ISCI-Szdrists alternative to SOL as the Shia partner       1.4(B)
    - Allawi supposedly angry at us as we had 'blocked' his Sadrist deal and now Maliki has 'won' them over                    1.4(D)
Allawi and the 90 other Irakiya COR members met this AM, Based on this morning's discussions (which are on-going),             B1
two of our contacts believe the following will occur (but this is not a final report!!):
    1. lraqiyya will vote unanimously against the return of Maliki as PM
    2. Iraqiyya will consider ISCl/Fadillah's defections as having eliminated the existence of the INA and NA, thus
        leaving Iraqiyya as the largest formal bloc
    3. Iraqiyya will only partner with SoL (and perhaps the Sadrists) if they allow Iraqiyya/Allawi to form the
        government
    4. Iraqiyya remains committed to a national unity government that is inclusive of all Kurdish, Shia, and Sunni
        factions

         Allawi meanwhile has decided on another perhaps week-long trip around the ME to garner support
         Bades Amiri and one other Badrist have joined the SOL-Sadrist support Maliki. Rest of Badr, and Fadillah, are
         still loyal to Al Hakim
         Kurds totally split internally. I am off to see Barham but they range from pro-Adel (Barham) to pro-Maliki
         (Talabani) to somewhere-in-the-middle (Mesud, Necivan). We will need more clarity on them to go far on any
         scenario. But they will look to us before making decisions.
