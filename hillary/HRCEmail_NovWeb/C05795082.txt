You should feel proud and satisfied. This was another of your projects which is making a real difference. And thanks for a
first rate EAP trip. Now we have to figure out our next moves in the spirit of ASEAN unity, now known as
obsequiousness.

Hope you get some rest--H

I hope you got away well to the Middle East after we left. I just wanted to drop you a note to let you that I went to the
American Pavilion at the Expo on the long stopover in Korea and it was a magical experience.

Our design using the projected images on the waterfalls, a wonderful visual surround, a great story line featuring how
the oceans link us, and wonderful student ambassadors put our exhibit at the top. Inspiring images of Cousteau and a
moving video testimonial by you. We are among the acknowledged best pavilions and everyone is really very pleased.

Thanks for allowing me and my team to take this is on. I have rarely felt such a sense of satisfaction and gratitude.

And a thrill of a lifetime to work with you again in Asia this past week. Best Kurt
