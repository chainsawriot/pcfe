Subject:                            Gun Control Petition



Dear all,
Let's actually DO something about the continual horror of mass shootings of innocent people, including the slaughter of
6 and 7-year old children and their teachers. It is time to take action and make change. Please sign this petition or one of
the many others circulating on the Internet and pass it on.

Let's take the spirit of the holiday season and turn it into action.
Anne-Marie
