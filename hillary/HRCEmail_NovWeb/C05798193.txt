Melanne, Please tell Hillary that she was absolutely fabulous testifying before the Senate last week. My favorite
moment was when she said, with incredulity, "Turkey191719" I was watching and shouted the same thing. It was
hilarious. I'm glad to see she is feeling better. I gather you won't be using this email for much longer. Hope to
see you soon. Sally Q
