BLUF: Coverage is generally down today. Al Kamen has a piece in WaPo downplaying expectations for S
testimony and Sen. Rand Paul gave extensive comments to Business Insider about his plans to "grill" S at the
hearing.



Summary of Selected Major Stories

(covering updates from 0700 1/15 to 0700 1/16)



•   Al Kamen / In the Loop: Clinton. Benghazi. Yawn? [WaPo, January 15]

                o While there has been "plenty of the breathless buildup" to the S testimony and conspiracy
                theories have been prevalent, "her appearance will probably be less fireworks and more `meh."

                o The reasons for no fireworks: "Clinton is a veteran witness, adept at dampening drama," and
                because there have been few "truly blockbuster" hearings recently.



• Rand Paul to hammer Hillary Clinton on Benghazi: 'It was a career-ending mistake' [Business
Insider, January 15]

                o As he prepares to make his debut on the SFRC, Sen. Paul said he plans on grilling S at the
                hearing, while speaking Business Insider on a recent trip to Israel.

                o On taking responsibility, Sen. Paul: "I think [Secretary Clinton] has to accept responsibility
                for Benghazi...That's the problem with goverment — government is anonymous and so no one

              is accountable. The reason you want somebody to be accountable is that you don't want someone
              to make that decision again...She needs to be held accountable for it."

              o On his plan to ask details about who denied security requests, Sen. Paul: "In government,
              there is usually an incentive to overspend when it comes to security...You're in charge of
              security in Benghazi and someone asks you for a 16-person detail — and the security people on
              the ground in Libya are asking you for it — it's impossible to say no. So how did someone
              possibly say no to that security? That's an incredible ineptness."

              o "It was an enormous mistake," he added. "It was a career-ending mistake, I think."

              o Sen. Paul is also likely to use the hearing to promote his plan for cutting foreign aid to Libya
              until Libya turns over the perpetrators.

              o In the end, though, the hearing "will probably fail to deliver the public retribution that
              conservatives like Paul have hoped for."



•   Police officer killed in Libya's Benghazi: security official [AFP, January 16]

              o A car bomb killed a police officer in Benghazi on Tuesday; his car exploded while he was
              coming home from a restaurant.

              o "The number of attacks targeting military and police officers, including ones who served the
              former regime, has increased in past weeks despite efforts by the new authorities to boost
              security."
