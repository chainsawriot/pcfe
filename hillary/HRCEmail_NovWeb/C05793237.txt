Madam Secretary: Thank you for both calls -- to the outgoing president and to the new president. We have already
followed up with the UN Political Offices in Nairobi and Mogadishu and are very confident that we can arrange for
President Hassan Sheik to participate in the UNGA discussions on Somalia via VTC. I also heard that former President
Sheik Sharrif tried to call you back to get further information on Amb. Charles Stith's program in Boston. I have
recommended to your staff that I take the call and put Sheik Sharrif directly in touch with Charles. Johnnie

Dear Johnnie,

I hope you saw in the memcon of my call w Hassan Sheik Mohamud that he can't come to UNGA but he would be
interested in doing a video appearance if that could be arranged. Will you discuss w 10 and USUN if that could be done?
Thanks. H
