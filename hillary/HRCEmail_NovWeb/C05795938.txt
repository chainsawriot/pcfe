Subject: Rwanda: Point for Rwanda FM on DRC Should She Approach the Secretary


Jake: I wanted to make sure you were aware that the Rwandan Foreign Minister Louise
Mushikiwabo is likely to be in Paris for the Syria conference and that she will almost certainly
try to approach the Secretary concerning the recent documented reports of Rwandan military
support (recruiting, training and arming Rwandaphones) for Congolese rebels in the DRC's
North Kivu province. The Department issued a statement on June 30 expressing deep concern
about Rwanda's actions and the Secretary approved a telegram letter to President Kagame on
July 2 reaffirming our strong bilateral ties but underscoring the need to stop/stop any Rwanda
assistance to rebels in the Eastern Congo.




   - Rwanda/DRC: Urge Rwanda to halt its support to Congolese rebels. Your July 2
      letter to President Kagame emphasized grave U.S. concerns over this support, which is
      well documented in UN reports and which

                                                                                 Suggest that President
       Kagame should speak with A/S Johnnie Carson.
