Subject:                         points for tomorrow



Senator Mitchell has asked his team to work on more detailed points for tomorrow's trilat. Because the key players are
                           they won't be able to complete this until quite late.                                          B5

As a result, we're sending you a document that walks through the major issues and gives a basic gameplan, and we'll get
you a more detailed paper first thing in the morning.

Hope this works.
