Just an FYI. Nothing for you to do here.

I spoke to Dr. Sujay last night                                I talked to her about a possible path forward on her
nomination and filled her in on conversations I had with both Kerry and Lugar's staffs about her nomination.

I apologize. These meetings have run (much) longer than expected. Is it still OK to call this evening? Am hoping to get out
shortly.

Thanks.

I know the waiting has been incredibly frustrating. I want to assure you that we have made every
attempt to secure you a confirmation hearing this month and have raised your nomination at every
opportunity. Unfortunately, we are at the mercy of the Senate, and more specifically, the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee.

We have advocated for your inclusion in each of the three State hearings this month. Unfortunately, the
hearings have been for career ambassadors going to specific geographic regions (Africa, East Asia, and
Pakistan). Despite our advocacy, the committee didn't see fit to add your nomination to any of those
hearings.

We had been talking with both Kerry and Lugar's staff about a hearing for you this week, specifically this
Thursday. However, it now looks like the Senate will recess Wednesday evening, making a Thursday
hearing impossible.

I did speak again this afternoon to Senator Lugar's staff, and they inform me that they have no objection
to pressing forward with a confirmation hearing for you during the Senate's lame duck session in
October. Although the length of that work period will be determined in large measure by the results of the
elections in November, I think we're all hopeful that there will be an opportunity for a hearing for you. No
guarantees of course, but we'll continue to press the committee as hard as we can.

Thanks.

Hi Cheryl:

Hope you're well. Will you have any time to speak today so I can update the Secretary on where things are with this
position?
 I know she is busy with the Mideast Peace Talks but this is also the last week Congress is in session and there's no
Hearing date set.

I saw her at Dr. Height's funeral and she whispered some concerns, and then I saw her this week at the Clinton Global
Initiative but was unable to get close to her, nor was it the appropriate time
. Here's my landline number                     I have a conference call from I-I:30pm. Other than that, I'd be available
Thanks

Sujay ( Sujzan Johnson Cook)
