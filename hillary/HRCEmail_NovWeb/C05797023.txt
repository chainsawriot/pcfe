I think they are preparing for your arrival! They'd probably love your congrats on this move when you're there.

Yup. But its all yours to make. Probably in the GCTF ministerial is your best bet.

Amazing! UAE leads the way.
Are we set for GU announcement and HRC's response? I will work with our speechwriter. I'm stranded in the fog in
Dhaka but hoping to get out later today for Sweden then catching up with everyone in Tunis and Abu Dhabi. See you
 soon.
