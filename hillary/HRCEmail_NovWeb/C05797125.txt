So glad we got this done. After spending the last 10 years on GTMO, at least this young man finally has another chance.

Omar Khadr is going home to Canada from Guantanamo;
The Toronto-born man who got to Guantanamo as a teenager was en route to more prison time in his native
Canada as of 4:30 a.m. Saturday under a 2010 plea deal, a U.S. military source tells The Miami Herald
By CAROL ROSENBERG, crosenberg@miamiherald.com, 29 September 2012, The Miami Herald
http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/09/29/3025662/omar-khadr-is-going-home-to-canada.html
The United States sent Guantanamo's youngest captive home to a prison in his native Canada early Saturday
morning, according to a U.S. military source, ending the decade-long detention of the young Muslim militant
who grew from a teenager into adulthood at the Pentagon's prison camps in Cuba.
Omar Khadr, 26, born in Toronto, pleaded guilty to war crimes charges in 2010 in exchange for an eight-year
sentence. Under the deal, he was to serve all but a year of it in Canada, where he will be eligible for early
release because he was a juvenile, just 15, when he committed his crimes in war-torn Afghanistan.
But the °barna administration was slow to sign off on his transfer and the Canadian government was even
slower to design a plan to hold him at home.
Saturday, a military source told The Miami Herald that Khadr was en route to his native Canada as of 4:30 a.m.,
a secret transfer under way just days after Khadr passed his 26th birthday with a visit from a Canadian diplomat
behind the prison's barbed wire. It was not immediately known where he'd be imprisoned but defense lawyers
had asked that he get special protections at the federal Canadian lockup because of his notoriety.
U.S. troops captured Khadr, who was near death, in a July 27, 2002 firefight at a suspected al Qaida compound
near Khost, Afghanistan.
U.S. air strikes had leveled the compound and as a Special Forces unit assaulted, Khadr admitted in his guilty
plea, he hurled a grenade from inside the rubble that mortally wounded Army Sgt. 1st Class Christopher Speer,
28. Medics were able to save Khadr's life, and turned him over to what became a decade of on-again off-again
interrogation.
The case of Khadr — Guantanamo's last Western captive —was a source of international debate.
Because he was captured at such a young age, just months into the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, some called
him a child soldier deserving of rehabilitation not interrogation. Psychiatrist Michael Welner, testifying at the
Guantanamo war court for the prosecution and paid by the Pentagon, called Khadr a continuing danger and that,
while in the U.S. prison camps in Cuba, Khadr was "marinating in a community of hardened and belligerent
radical Islamists."
Khadr's lawyers countered with a Canadian-style college preparatory curriculum. While Khadr served his
sentence in Guantanamo's cellblock for convicted war criminals, he filled his time with remedial studies
designed by a Canadian college professor — literature, physics and videos of "Little Mosque on the Prairie," a
popular Canadian TV show about a Muslim community in a fictional prairie town. He also read Shakespeare
with his U.S. Army defense lawyer, a tall lieutenant colonel who read Juliet to IChadr's Romeo.

Under the terms of his plea agreement, Khadr admitted to planting landmines in Afghanistan meant to shred
invading allied forces. Once captured, and interrogated, he directed U.S. troops back to their location to safely
disarm them.
Testimony at pre-trial hearings showed U.S. interrogators saw the 15-year-old as a human intelligence treasure
trove because as a child his family had spent time with the family of Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan. His
father, killed in Pakistan in 2003, was seen in Canada as a high-level al Qaida functionary who moved his
family to Pakistan and Afghanistan in the years before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
One of Omar Khadr's elder brothers, Abdurahman, also spent a short time in Guantanamo as an informant but
never saw his kid brother there. Abdurahman is now free in Toronto. With Saturday's transfer, the Pentagon
was holding 166 detainees at Guantanamo.
The youngest is now believed to be a Yemeni named Hassan bin Attash, whose leaked detention records
indicate he was born in Yemen in 1985. He's the younger brother of former CIA captive Walid bin Attash, an
alleged al Qaida lieutenant now at Guantanamo facing war crimes charges in the five-man Sept. 11 death
penalty trial.
The Khadr transfer could break a logjam in efforts to get other captives to plead guilty. Defense lawyers have
characterized the Obama administration's inability to get Khadr back to Canada as an obstacle to negotiations
with other alleged al Qaida foot soldiers whose testimony might be useful at the Guantanamo war court.
