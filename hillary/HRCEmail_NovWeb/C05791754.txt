I think I'm on to something here. Especially since the last three Presidents - the first baby boomers to reach the office -
only had daughters.



Studies: Having Daughters Changes Men
By Sharon Jayson
USA TODAY
6/14/2007

Daughters are shaped by their fathers, of course, but being the father of girls also can change the way men look at the
world, research suggests.

In a study completed last month, a Yale researcher found that male congressmen with daughters are more likely to
support women's issues than those without daughters.

The findings, an update to a study published last year by the National Bureau of Economic Research, also show that the
more daughters a congressman had, the more likely he was to vote for reproductive rights, says Ebonya Washington, an
assistant economics professor at Yale.

Her new research, not yet published, expands on an analysis she did of roll-call votes during the 105th Congress in 1997-
98 when she examined family composition and compared the data with voting records compiled by other groups. She
used rankings by the National Organization for Women, based on votes on 20 women's issues such as equal rights,
women's safety, economic security, education, health and reproductive rights. She also reviewed voting data from the
National Right to Life Committee.

Her new analysis included congressional votes through 2004 and added information from another group: the American
Association of University Women. She again found voting record support for a daughter-to-father influence.

Prior research into the father-daughter bond has centered more on anecdotes and less on science, says Kyle Pruett, a
clinical professor of psychiatry at Yale University's Child Study Center.

Pruett, who has three daughters ages 8 to 35, began interviews with 20 families with stay-at-home dads in 1982. He did
follow-up interviews after eight and 10 years and included some of his findings in his 2000 book, Fatherneed. "Daughters
make (fathers) think differently about how they're going to make the world a better place," he says.

Sociology professor Scott Coltrane of the University of California-Riverside interviewed 80 parents of schoolchildren in
California for his 1996 book Family Man.

"Fathers who have only daughters tend to instill in their daughters an achievement motivation," he says. "They become
more sensitive to discrimination — cultural images about girls and their body image and sexuality, violence against
women and equal opportunity in the workplace."

Long story as to why I thought to research this, but here's another historical trend working against Mitt Romney and his
brood of only sons: it has been half a century since we've had a President without a daughter. It's happened only once
in the past 80 years.
