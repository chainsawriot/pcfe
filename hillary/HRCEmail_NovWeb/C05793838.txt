Hi Huma. Making sure you all got this yesterday given everything going on in Jordan. Chelsea's mother-in-law was at the
Dead Sea resorts when things started. All good now. Best, Matt

FYI — RSO reports the group made it safely to the airport after a circuitous routing around the road closures. Matt

FYI in case it comes up on the 7th floor —RSO Amman is driving down to the Holiday Inn at the Dead Sea tonight to pick
up Marjorie Margolis Mezvinsky (Chelsea Clinton's mother-in-law) and two colleagues who there for a conference and
are scheduled to fly out of Amman a few hours from now. The road to/from the Dead Sea has been disrupted by
protests throughout the day.

We don't believe that she has a working cell phone here. We've been calling her by calling the Holiday Inn front desk
and asking for her.

The number is: 05-349-5555

Importance: High

Correction — Mezvinsky not the mother of the FSO. She's Chelsea Clinton's mother-in-law. Which answers the S
question.

Subject: Call from S on Dead Sea road closure

Sir,

We just received a call from S's office (Brock Johnson) regarding three Amcits staying at the Holiday Inn at the Dead
Sea. They had intended to check out and return to Amman to catch a flight, but the hotel told them that the Dead Sea
road was closed due to protests. We spoke to one of the Amcits, who was calm and said she would wait the situation
out at the Dead Sea.

 I've let Bart know, but wanted to make you aware of S's involvement. We are not clear who called Washington.

 Incidentally, the Amcit we talked to is Marjorie Margolis Mezvinsky, and is the mother of an FSO. She said that she was
 at a conference with Mrs. Jones today.

 - Ian.
