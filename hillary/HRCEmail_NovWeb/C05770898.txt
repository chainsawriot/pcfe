In this morning's 8:45, which Cheryl chaired:

The FY11 approps bill was marked up in the Senate yesterday; we are working on details and evaluation which Rich will
share separately. Pat K highlighted the complicated offsets to the                 estored in consular fees, which included
slashes to Iraq/Pak funding and CSI/CRS, among other items. Rich cautioned that the bill is unlikely to move anywhere
quickly, noting the political dynamic likely to ensue from the inclusion of the Lautenberg amendment lifting the global
gag rule and the broadest version of the Avena consular notifications language, among other issues. The President
signed the supp last night; we have 90 days from 7/29 for our spending plan submission to OMB.

A mid-September date for                                                                           will be taken up in its
place next week. Kerry and Lugar are expected to issue their workplan for the next six weeks as early as tonight.

Our post in Ciudad Juarez, which handles all immigrant visas from Mexico and is the world's largest consular operation,
is closed today due to credible threat reporting. They will re-evaluate over the weekend.

Pi and Rich discussed working up some press interest in the Kyl-held nomination of Raul Yzaguirre to go to the
DR. We've already engaged McCain on his nomination.

Piper C noted Jack would call Michele Flournoy today on the              in 1207 funds which DoD now appears to want
to mark for Pakistan; they had been penciled in for Timor, Ecuador, Guatemala. She added they had had a good trip
through Iraq but the magnitude of the tasks related to the military turnover is sobering.
