I'm happy to do public swearing in whenever. I won't call unless you have matters to discuss--and you can call me on my
berry for another 30 minutes before we leave Alaska.

Cheryl,

Hope all is wel1.1 am now on my third visit to Port Of Spain. The upgrades Bea's interior decorator along with technology
improvements has really turned this into a real residence. It has also put the                                    But, she's
pleased and that's what's important.The Embassy staff appears to be responding positively to her apporach.She hosted
a reception for the entire Embassy and insisted that it included the janitors and cleaning staff. I think it surprised the
Senior staff.

I wanted to mention that Bea would still like the Secretary to do her public swearing in whenever her schedule permits.




Take Care,

TonyW.
