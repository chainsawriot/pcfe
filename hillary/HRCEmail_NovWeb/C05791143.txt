I was supposed to speak at Wellesley tom'w, but since it's a banquet feast of great speakers, starting with yourself,
Madeleine, etc, I'm going to go at the end of the institute with Jane Harman. Hopefully, she will be able to finalize the
move of Women in Public Service to Wilson by then and be in a position to announce it at that time. In the meantime, we'll
work during the next ten day to make it to the finish line.

I'm sure you'll have a wonderful time.

Also, I heard Chelsea was nominated by DVF to serve on the Vital Voices board and the nomination was unanimously
adopted. I hope she'll do it as she'll bring a generational perspective and more.
