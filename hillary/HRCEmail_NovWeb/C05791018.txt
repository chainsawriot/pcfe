There were more upgrades than downgrades this year, and I'd be happy to send that to you also.
There are some real success stories. That said, here are the downgrades: Tier 1 to Tier 2:
Bosnia & Herzegovina; South Korea; Nigeria; Portugal. Tier 2 to Tier 2 WL: Bahrain;
Djibouti; Jamaica; Kenya; Macau; Malawi; Namibia; Senegal; Seychelles; Sierra Leone;
Suriname. Tier 2 WL to Tier 3: Syria
