Huma: I'd be very grateful if you'd pass this to the Secretary as soon as possible, as I wanted her (and you all) to be the
first to know this information. Many thanks. Eric


Madam Secretary:

As Cheryl may have told you, I was approached some time ago by the University of Minnesota about succeeding Brian
Atwood as Dean of the Humphrey School of Public Affairs, and I have now accepted an offer they have extended. This
has been the most difficult career decision I have ever confronted, as I cannot imagine a more meaningful or fulfilling
position than the one I now hold. Moreover, I cannot imagine a more inspiring and supportive leader than you have been
to me, and to the humanitarian mission of the U.S. Government.




I was so honored when you asked me to serve as State's senior humanitarian official in the winter of 2009. It was an
opportunity of a lifetime, and I have worked each and every day to justify your trust and your confidence â€” traveling
to dozens of countries where our humanitarian diplomacy and assistance has made a difference in safeguarding lives and
promoting reconciliation, visiting and keeping faith with vulnerable women, men and children in some of the most difficult
environments, sustaining our world leadership in international humanitarian response and our unequivocal support from
the Congress, and strengthening the policy engagement and the operational capacity of a bureau -- PRM -- that has some
of the most dedicated and skilled professionals I have ever encountered.

As I told Cheryl, I've always believed deeply that how one leaves a job may be as important as how one executes
responsibilities day-in and day-out, and I am committed to ensuring that my transition does not impair the effectiveness
of the Department's humanitarian (or QDDR) work. To that end, I have arranged with the University a mid-October start
date, which should give me the chance to bring to closure a number of important Bureau policy initiatives and, more
importantly, should give the Department adequate time to ensure a smooth transition.

I will do everything I can to help.

In short, on this or any other issue relating to the transition, I remain able and eager to assist in any way possible.

I regret that I am not able to speak with you in person on this important news, but I wanted to be sure that you were the
first to know.

I look forward to opportunities over the next several months to thank you again, for your confidence in me and for your
leadership

Kind regards,
Eric
