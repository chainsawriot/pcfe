On the younger side, so less stature but bolder moves:

But let me ask this ques - who has your stature that if this was a blank slate that you would rec to succeed you?

Cheryl,
As I look at all the holes that are already becoming apparent re ourability to do development as I phase out and i
were not here, I wonder again if we shdnt try to hire        as deputy director for development in S/P before I leave or        B6
w/ the transition (this is assuming         ;ucceeds me). Given how much time I put in to trying to get the rest of the
building to pay attention to development and to pushing that entire part of S's agenda (as do u, of course), which
will not do except as specifically tasked, I am increasingly worried about what is going to happen. I think she wd take the
job if properly formulated, and we will HAVE an open slot by the end of the year (I just found that out.) But ithe trick is
making it a deputy directorship -- like a DAS anywhere else.
