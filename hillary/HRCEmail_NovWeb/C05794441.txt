The speech "as prepared" got good coverage! (We won't tell the press that a lot of their quotes weren't delivered.)

To Dan's credit and ability to read your mind, he saw it coming as the program unfolded, and emailed us predicting
you'd likely be doing some real-time edits. Sounds like it was the right call.

And the point of this speech is that it's designed to be given in many settings, so eventually you'll give the whole.thing
(hopefully)!

I thought that was absolutely the right call given how the program unfolded. That film was quite something! I told
Philippe he really needs to see it. They're sending over a copy and we'll get it to you.

Subject: Wilson speech

By the time I got up to speak, Jane Harmon and Christine Legarde had spoken a lot about me, them and women and
there didn't seem to be much of an appetite in the audience for a serious speech--always a problem at these dinners--so
I abbreviated Iran and Arab sections and skipped most of the section about women and made an appeal for the US still
showing we can get things done keying off Fred Malik's opening comments. And I had dozens of people on the way out
thank me and say how "inspirational" it was. Go figure.

Pls get me both a transcript of what I ended up saying and a copy of the campy film all the former Sec States made.
