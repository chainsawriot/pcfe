Subject: Saud al-Faisal call

Jake: in the middle of all the craziness last evening, Adel Jubeir called to say that                                            B6
                                                                         Adel said the FM would much appreciate a call
from the Secretary, and gave me the residence number:                        We'll put all this in a call sheet and send it up
presently, unless you think otherwise.
