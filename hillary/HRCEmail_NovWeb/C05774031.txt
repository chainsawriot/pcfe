Based on my call, she's wrong about Brazil using coup word. Can you clarify--and correct if necessary?

Subject: Paraguay update

There have been a number of developments on Paraguay today. A number of UNASUR (S. America)
countries, among them Brazil and Argentina had already announced the recall of their
ambassadors in Asuncion. Chile, Colombia and Peru have called their ambassadors back "for
consultations" and in conversations I had with Chilean foreign minister Moreno and Colombian
foreign minister Holguin they implied this will not necessarily be for extended
periods. Moreno and Holguin told me that any UNASUR/MERCOSUR suspensions of Paraguay are
likely to be political and not include economic sanctions. They also outlined a way forward
which might involve an OAS mission to Paraguay, with the aim of getting elections, currently
scheduled for April 2013, moved up.


The Chileans and Colombians have been careful not to characterize the events in Paraguay as a
"coup." However, I understand from the Secretary's call with foreign minister Patriota that
Brazil is using that term as well as calling them "an interruption in democratic order,"
which would allow the invocation of the OAS democratic charter. Tom and I have talked to the
Brazilians, urging use of the OAS' institutional capability for national dialogue and
launching the electoral process, but the Brazilians have boxed themselves in, and will want
to be seen as leading.


                                           OAS Secretary General Insulza told Amb. Lomellin
that the OAS Permanent Council will meet on Tuesday to discuss Paraguay. We are issuing new
press guidance, which notes our concern with the speed of the impeachment process, Lugo's

decision to accept the outcome, the new government's commitment to elections, and our
commitment to stay engaged in support of democracy together with other Western Hemisphere
countries.

I'll speak to more in the region tomorrow, and head to Central America on Tuesday for a
previously-planned trip which will give me the opportunity to consult with all the presidents
and continue to work that moderate coalition.

Thanks, Roberta
