Sorry to bother you given all the head aches of the world, but on possible speech topics, some of our
big areas of focus are:

1. China - how we view the relationship over the long term; how it has grown over just the first year
of the Obama admin. As you may know, Rudy DeLeon is our SVP for National Security and he is a
former Dep Sec of Defense, so he often sees things from the military's perspective (he said that his
friends in the military in the Pacific said you were amazing with the Chinese last week; and that the
Chinese military was horrible - not sure what that means, but I'm hoping it will mean something to
you.) However, we have also worked on many aspects of the relationship - from trade, to spheres of
influence, towards managing China's role on Iran and North Korea.

2. An Integrated National Security Budget is an idea that we have championed for some time.

3. Climate change and its impact on foreign policy decisions. (Working in any reference to BP and
how it affects our international relationships - and just making sure it doesn't do so adversely - will
make news! :)

4. The rise of India and the unique possibilities of partnership over the long term. John has asked
me to strengthen our India program, which I am starting to work on now. CAP has already done
extensive work on energy issues, and we're now moving into economic issues, like a shared
innovation agenda and will then build up to more direct foreign policy concerns. The Indian Embassy
recently reached out to me to have CAP get involved on issues across a range of subjects. My main
theory is that if CAP is more pro-India on economic issues for which we can push against the left (like
on outsourcing), we may be better positioned as an organization to put some pressure on India (and
as a person who gets a fair amount of Indian press on domestic issues, perhaps I can do some
good). I know you are having the Strategic Dialog now, and so the timing of this may be better
ahead of foreign travel in the fall. (An interesting side note, we're seeing a huge increase in support
for economic nationalism across the country - which cascades into Iranian sanctions and punishing
corporations that undermine America's interest there, but also is creating stronger opposition to
outsourcing, which I think will (unfortunately) be an issue as India comes into focus through a
Presidential foreign trip in the fall.)

Of course, we're also happy to host you for any subject you'd like!

Thanks again for considering the speech and sorry to intrude when the crush of world events is (once
again) at your doorstep.
Though, as always, it makes me feel more secure knowing that you are there!

Neera---Thx for the updates.


I would welcome the chance to speak at CAP again--I did once last year but its time to use it as a venue for a big speech
again. I'll see what we can plan. Do you have any ideas?

I'll check on               Hope you and the family are will--Happy Summer! H

I know world events are pressing in, but thought I'd send an update on the health care story, which I promised to do.



I spent a lot of times with Robert Pear about 10 days ago and then checked back in with him a couple of days ago. I gave
him everything off the record, with the understanding that he would report out this story in his own voice. I gave him the
FEHBP story, in addition to all of the policies in the bill that were in your campaign plan (and that weren't in the Obama
campaign plan). He was very interested; in our conversation last week, he indicated that his own reporting preliminarily
indicated that the FEHBP idea didn't originate on the Hill. He has a fair amount more work to do on the story, but he
seems rett excited about it, or as excited as Robert cije*__




Also, I meant to tell you this on the phone last week, but I understand             may be up for an important job at
State. I don't know much of anything about it, and the job may have been filled by now, but he was very helpful to the
campaign, so I thought I'd send that along.



Finally, I have to put a pitch in for you to speak at CAP. I know John has talked to Cheryl about this a few times, so I don't
mean this as overkill, but as Secretary of State you've been to Brookings for a few events, and it would be great if you

could do a speech at CAP. We are pretty good at driving press coverage for our events, though of course, you hardly
need that assurance.



Hope you had time to rest over Memorial Day weekend, before the crush of events.
