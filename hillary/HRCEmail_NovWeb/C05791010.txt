Subject:                           follow-up to yesterday's email, re Nairobi terrorist attack



I also wanted to follow-up on an issue that is very important to me â€” compensation for the families of State Department
personnel who were killed in the Nairobi terrorist attack in 1998. I have tried to solve this with 3 Presidents and 3
Secretaries of State, yet I have been met by same old answers and zero willingness to help these families. Hillary, if I
can't resolve this with you, I will never be able to resolve it. Like you, I believe in the fierce urgency of now.

I have gotten to know some of these families. Julian Bartley was the highest ranking African American as Consul General
serving in Nairobi His son, Julian Jr. was interning at the Embassy that summer. Jay's body was cut in half in the
explosion. He would have been 35 years old this October. Other victims left young children. One of the injured was
blinded and contracted HIV while being treated in a Kenyan Hospital. I know you want to help these families as much as
I do.

I got strong language in the Foreign Aid Appropriations bill that requires State to report on US victims of terrorism, and
to draft a plan for providing compensation. I want to use this report and info to draft comprehensive legislation to
provide compensation to American victims of terrorist attacks.

I need you to give me a high level, fresh person to work with at the State Department to resolve this issue. Someone
who will come in the room with the willingness to offer solutions. We just need some fresh ideas and the will to put
these ideas into action. I know we can do it.

Forward together!
Barb
