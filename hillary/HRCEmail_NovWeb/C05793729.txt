Dear Friends,



Be ready to be shocked, but please read to the end of this letter. YOU can
help stop the abuse.


Just before the holidays, Little Mo, the 4-year-old boy who lived with us
for the last year, returned to his home in the remote mountains of
Morocco. We miss him terribly. I am writing a book about Little Mo, the
boy with magnetic powers who changed everyone he met. If you want to
read some of the regular updates I continue to write, please let me know.


Since Little Mo's departure, I have embarked on another project with my
friend Jeanet Ingalls who grew up on the streets of the Philippines. She
suffered and survived unspeakable abuse. We are producing a
documentary based on her life to expose the rampant sex trade active in
the United States and worldwide


Read the attached story to hear Jeanet's story and our project.

According to UNICEF, criminals force an estimated 1.2 million children a year into
the sex trade, making Human trafficking the second-largest organized crime
business in the world: a multi-billion dollar business based on degradation and
suffering of children.



I was one of those children.

My mother, an alcoholic, a drug addict and a prostitute, brought me into the ugly
and dangerous underworld of the Philippine society. From the age of three, I
scrounged for food, clothes, and money. I pilfered garbage, slept on the streets,
waded in polluted drainage canals for coins, and basically did anything to survive. I
saw many of my friends disappear, kidnapped by the pimps. They lured us with a
promise of a better life, easy money, and attention. All they needed to offer us was
a little food or a bottle of coke. Food lured me to a room above a bar just down the
hall from where my mother worked as a prostitute. A couple forced me and other
children to perform unspeakable acts. A gun and knife to our heads to insured our
full co-operation.



I was one of the lucky ones. I escaped.



At age seven, an American family adopted me and brought me to the Berkshires. I
will never completely overcome my past. I feel compelled to help children
suffering as I did. I am determined to use my harsh life experience to work to help
liberate millions of invisible children, now exploited in the sex trade around the
world.



I have created SHOUT OUT LOUD, a non-profit film production company, which
will bring the magnitude of this subversive subculture, and business that is
permeating our societies into public awareness. We are beginning with two projects.



The first is a series of video diaries that will trace my life. We will return to the
Philippines and speak to present day children who have been coerced into and
trapped in the ever-booming sex-trafficking business. We will also have
conversations with experts who will help us understand how this life experience
continues to torment the lives of these children who universally suffer from Post
Traumatic Stress Disorder \(PTSD) even if they are lucky enough to escape: These
diaries will eventually be edited into a documentary film that will be used to
educate us about the pervasive reach of sex trafficking and its life long effects.

The second project, I plan to produce a feature film, Between Sea and
Sky, with award winning screenwriter Stephen Glantz and cinematographer Richard
Sands. This film based on my life recounts my story and the story of friends, aged
three to seven who ran the streets with me. Many of them disappeared. I want to
give a voice to these children and give them a chance to SHOUT OUT LOUD. I
intend to educate my audience with this film. We will market it to film festivals
and show it in many public settings.



To start developing the video diaries and the feature film, I must raise $70,000 and I
need your help to do this. You can visit my                                            •
website, http://www.shoutoutloudproductions.com, to learn more about the Between
Sea and Sky film project and me.

sending a check made out to Shout Out Loud Productions, P.O. Box 1875, Lenox,
MA 01240. Any amount is appreciated. Your support counts and places you among
those SHOUTING OUT LOUD against this horrific practice. All donations are tax
deductible. Creating this film brings out many difficult emotions and traumatic
memories for me, but these children's voices must be heard. Please join me in
bringing this cause into the open. Young children depend on us to act. I
appreciate your support very much and will keep you updated on our progress.


Sincerely,


Jeanet Ingalls
