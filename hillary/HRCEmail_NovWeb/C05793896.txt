It's nice to think of you answering emails somewhere on a quiet and lovely Saturday morning; I only hope it's
Chappaqua! (I never told you but
                                     . I truly hope you will consider coming to Princeton as our baccalaureate speaker
(that's another one in your stack of emails). No need to respond to this one — it's lovely to hear from you. And Happy
Thanksgiving!
Best,
AM

See this final part of Gail Coffins' column today:

"If she really does drop out of politics and move on, this will probably be Clinton's future.
Championing the cause of women, continuing her mega-listening tours around the globe, having
serious conversations about issues of great import and minimal glamour. At State, she's dug deep
into the bureaucracy, trying to ensure that American diplomacy will be promoting women's
empowerment many secretaries down the line. "We've created some positions," Clinton said,
making a list. "We have embedded it in the quadrennial diplomacy and development review
process..."

That's the thing about Hillary Clinton. Most famous woman in the world, but still a sucker for the
quadrennial diplomacy and development review process."

And I'm completely with you on home decorating, organizing, etc. Almost two years later and
STILL what I want to do most is get my house in shape!
Best,
AM
