See below from Marc Sievers
Rafi Issawi called me from Amman. He confirmed that lraqiyya's leadership endorsed Adel candidacy and finalized
approval of the agreement reached with ISCI a week ago. He said they also agreed that Ayad is their candidate for
President but they are not announcing that in the media due to Kurdish sensitivities. Rafi confirmed that most of the group
will return to Baghdad tomorrow and will meet with the Kurdish negotiators tomorrow at 6 pm.
