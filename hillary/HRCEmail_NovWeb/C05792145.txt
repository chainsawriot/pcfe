Michael Oren called re attack in last few hours along Gaza/Egy/Isr border. Call was informational -- no Isr requests.
According to Michael, PIJ attempted attack across border, and in process opened fire on Egy border post, killed as many
as 15 Egy, and commandeered two BMPs. One destroyed by Egy, one by IAF. No Isr casualties. IDF in touch directly with
Egy mil, still combing Isr side of border. Passed all this on to Beth moment ago.
