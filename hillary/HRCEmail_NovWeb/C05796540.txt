The latest is that Kuwait will transfer the funds to their DC account this week and then pay. I know its all roundabout but
for reasons I won't go into, - to do with their internal chaos - they're bending some budget rules to do this. I'm doing all I
can to hasten. They also don't want publicity over it.
By the way one part of our new plan should be an actual agreement with Arabs that they will pay more and sooner!

Kuwaiti money en route but taking time, going to their embassy in dc and thrn world bank, for political reasons. She
