   • The Pakistani public is broadly aware of foreign assistance pledged to those affected by the August
     floods, particularly aid from the United States, China and Saudi Arabia.
           o   When asked about each country separately, two-thirds ormore say the United States (66%),
               China (79%) and Saudi Arabia (84%) have provided "a great deal" or "a fair amount" of
               assistance to Pakistanis affected by flooding (see Survey Findings, Page 2 of 2).
           o   When asked what one foreign country is doing the most to aid those affected by flooding,
               Pakistanis are most likely to name Saudi Arabia (45%). The United States (18%) and China
               (18%) tie for a distant second (see below).

                                      been affected by the flooding?" (asked open-end, %)
