At the game, and have read this message but obviously haven't talked to Paul or RCH. Thought it important enough to
send along immediately.

Sorry for such a long email on a sports and holiday weekend. Please let me know what if anything I or our team can
do. While I outlined this approach to Richard in a telephone call, I take full responsibility for everything written here.

Cheers, Paul
