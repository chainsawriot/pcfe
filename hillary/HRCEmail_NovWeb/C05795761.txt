Cheryl, Please extend our thanks to the Secretary for today's moving event. As always, her remarks (the President's and
the chaplain's) were just right. I will also send a note to Pat and Capricia to thank them for a well led day that helped
build solidarity, despite the sorrow.

Thanks also for Cindy and Yael â€” they are a pleasure to work with every day.

We are making real progress.

Best, Rick
