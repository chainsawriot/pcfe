Some of it has been since put out by IDF spokesmen,




About 2.5 to 3 hours later, Israeli soldiers boarded the main deck of the main ship. They met with what
described as clearly planned active/armed resistance, including live fire.

                            Those on the ship attacked the military who boarded with knives, sharpened metal and
wood instruments, etc. He said the military who boarded were attacked in each case by dozens;

                                                              He indicated that some of the soldiers were stabbed and
slashed — did not say how severely. Made clear situation was one in which actions taken were in self-defense.

Current estimates of those killed from flotilla 14-15 "maybe more". He said all injured being moved to Israeli hospital —
the severely injured already moved by helicopter. He said ships coming into Ashdod (some reports have them coming
into Haifa). When he spoke with me he was en route to meet them.

At Ashdod, he and others will meet the ships. There, they will need to ID the bodies; move the people either to return
them to home countries rapidly and/or detain; ID the cargo and as planned initially, move as much of into Gaza as
promptly as possible.

Earlier this morning               made the following calls/contacts:

discussed extent to which levels of rhetoric could be kept in check. With Fayyad they discussed primarily need for
security cooperation, keeping things calm. Much concern about how this will be affected by status of Israeli Arab Islamic
leader on board the flotilla.                                                                                 (PIC      1.4(B)
