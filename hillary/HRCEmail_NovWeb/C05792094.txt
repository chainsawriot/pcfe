 Subject: CSCC op ed

 I've attached a copy of a draft op ed about the creation and work of the Center for Strategic Counter-terrorism
 Communications (CSCC) that Richard LeBaron and I have been working on. We want to try and get it
 published in the next few weeks in the run up to 9/11. It's an important initiative and we'd like to heighten
 awareness of State's contributions in this area in the hopes of maintaining support for it in the future.

  Among other things, I think CSCC provides a good example of your approach to these most difficult
  challenges and to public diplomacy more broadly: appropriately define your audience; go where they hang
  out; use all the tools we have, including digital media; deliver messages which resonate; be sure our narrative
  is part of the debate; and provide platforms for engagement. It all seems so incredibly obvious to me that I
 â€¢was always surprised when we encountered resistance both within State and from those on the outside.

 Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
