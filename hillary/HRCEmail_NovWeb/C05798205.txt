What we do as an institution., what you have done for these last 4 years... matters greatly .. And it's a better place
now. And it's a better place moving forward because you walked/prowled/scowled/paced/yelled and even on the odd
occasion hugged the halls. And throughout the history of the place.. there is a really short list of people that can be said
about. The place will be sharing and passing along CDM memories/stories for a long time. And that only happens for
the best of the best. Enjoy stepping over to the other side of something. With the highest regards, Rich Greene
