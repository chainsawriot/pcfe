Ned Nolan (DCM in The Hague) called to give me a heads up that Fay intends to submit her
resignation as Ambassador due to personal considerations -
                                                                                                  She is
planning to depart post o/a September 15.

I then called Fay myself and this is clearly a difficult decision for her as she really loves what she is
doing and is torn. She is planning to call Phil tomorrow to discuss with him directly. She has already
spoken to Valerie Jarrett and Bill Daley at the White House (friends from Chicago) to let them
know. She has not yet told anyone at the Embassy other than Ned, and will likely let her country
team know later this week or next week. In the meantime, she asked that we not spread the word
too widely since she wants her folks to hear the news from her directly.

Monika - can you please reach out to Fay's assistant, Wanda Kleinsmith, to set up a time for a phone
call?
