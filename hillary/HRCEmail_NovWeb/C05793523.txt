Hillary,

I just heard that you have been under the weather. My thoughts are with you as you recover. Don't hesitate if I can do
anything for you. My mom always recommended a bit of chicken noodle soup.

And please don't worry about connecting with me on the work matters until you are really up to it. I am sorry that I had
known of your illness earlier.

Gary
