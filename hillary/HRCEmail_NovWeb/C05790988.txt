Subject:                           Vital Voices


Your presence was felt tonight in so many ways -- the foremost of which was Chelsea. It was fabulous to have her for the
first time and she was terrific. She'd rewritten her script and was both personal, funny and inspirational.She mentioned
that she too was at the first Vital Voices conference in Vienna (by the way, Swanee was there tonight and very happy).
Chelsea also talked about your commitment to women's issues and while most people would describe that as a
commitment to the next generation, she said, "if my mom were here she'd describe it as a commitment to the
grandchildren she's hoping to have!"

Bill Burns was in the presidential box with his girls, which was very nice. The place was jammed with your friends from all
over the country. It was like a campaign rally and almost turned in to one when Tawakkol, the Nobel laureate from Yemen,
kept talking and then started chanting,
"1,2, 3, 4, push Assad out the door." And the audience eaped her on. We barely avoided a diplomatic incident! The only
sad moment was                                                                                   so her spot on the stage
was a spotlight with no one under it.

Your introduction was over the top,but I'm very grateful that you made W happen and it's just so gratifying to see where it
is today.

Finally Kay Hutchison said she'd like to see you.

We missed you hugely but Chelsea was a wonderful stand-in for her mom.
