Subject: Note for the Secretary

Cheryl,
Thank you for your facilitation of today's meeting and for what was, at least from my perspective, a very useful
conversation. Would appreciate your conveying the following note to the Secretary. Thanks very much.
Wendy

Dear Madam Secretary,

Thank you very much for taking some of your very precious time to talk with me this afternoon. From my
perspective, I found it a very useful conversation to better understand the challenges in front of you and the
Department, daunting as they are. I appreciated as well the candor and sensitivity of the private discussion, a
frankness that is essential to ensuring you get the best outcome to help solve problems and meet the needs of the
country. I hope you felt you got direct responses from me and a better idea of capabilities and understandings
that I bring to the table. I look forward to the further conversations you suggested and any other steps needed as
part of your decision-making. And, as always, I am committed to supporting you whether in or out of
government.

Thank you again,
Wendy
