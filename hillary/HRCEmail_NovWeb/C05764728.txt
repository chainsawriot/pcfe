Why not                   as G?                                          -- why not find      something great and move
them both back here?       has overseen disaster relief and immigration policy, both relevant for PRM;       has a civil
rights backround, core for human rights:       been deeply engaged in Latin American issues. And         would love to take
on GTIP. More broadly global affairs are largely issues that were once internal affairs gone global -- environment, rights,
population management, crime.                                                 . AMS
