BREAKING - New Romney campaign ad, "No Evidence" -- Male narrator: "When a President doesn't tell
the truth, how can we trust him to lead? The Obama outsourcing attacks: 'misleading, unfair and untrue.' There
was 'no evidence' that Mitt Romney shipped jobs overseas. Candidate Obama lied about Hillary Clinton."

Jumps to then-Sen. Hillary Clinton, in Cincinnati on Feb. 23, 2008: "So shame on you, Barack Obama. [It is
time you ran a campaign consistent with your messages in public. That's what I expect from you.]" Male
narrator: "But America expects more from a president. Obama's dishonest campaign: Another reason America
has lost confidence in Barack Obama." YouTube http://bit.ly/OzLjLD
