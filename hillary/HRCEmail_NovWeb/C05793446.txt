Indeed. Can we touch base before Sunday, Jake? Would be invaluable to hear your personal thoughts, before the
meeting.

I just received a call from JSR Lakhdar Brahimi (LB). He expressed great appreciation for S's engagement in Dublin. He
was very impressed with how she had handled the discussion with SL and said he could not have asked for anything
more.
                                                                                                                1.4(B)
As for the meeting on Sunday with D (B) and DFM Bogdanov, LB's current, tentative thinking is as follows:       1.4(D)
                                                                                                                B1

All of above is his very preliminary thinking. He is open to any suggestions/concerns we have. He'll likewise consult the
Russians and make sure they are comfortable with this.

LB suggested that we talk again on Saturday, so he can provide a firmer idea of how he intends to play the meeting.

Best,
Salman
