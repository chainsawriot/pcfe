I know it would be complicated and there are reasons not to, but I think it would be a huge mistake to not consider him
for some of the spokesman responsibilities. For what it's worth, Rich and Derek agree he's far and away the best
surrogate we have and we underuse him on this front.

I'm not saying that as someone who has become a close colleague and friend of his - he doesn't even know I'm writing
this. I'm saying ths in answer to your question of who would be the best spokesman, what's best for you.
