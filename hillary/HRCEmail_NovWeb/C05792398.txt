What we've picked up as of around 10:30 pm Wednesday evening:

Shots were fired in the neighborhood of the Cabinet Secretary General's building, down the street from the PM's office in
Ramallah. Everyone in the neighborhood reportedly heard the shots at around Iftar (around 7:45 pm here).

The policemen/guards who were there gave conflicting reports to superior officers who are now investigating. One guard said that he
fired several bullets because passengers in a speeding car opened fire towards the building. Another claimed it was accidental
discharge. All policemen/guards around the two buildings are being questioned.

Sense here is that it was a policeman covering up his negligent discharge, which we hear is not uncommon. Apparently, two years
ago, in an accidental discharge incident, a policeman killed himself. The whole incident was captured by surveillance cameras. So this
time they are checking cameras too.
