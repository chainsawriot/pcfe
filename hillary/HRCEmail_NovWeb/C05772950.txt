Subject: Iraq parliament approves Sunni al-Nujalfi as speaker (U)

(U) Reuters reported Iraq's parliament elected Sunni lawmaker Osama al-Nujaifi, a senior leader of the Sunni-backed,
cross-sectarian Iraqiya alliance, as speaker, a key step toward the formation of a new government. Iraqi politicians
reached agreement late on a power-sharing deal that divides the three top government posts among Shiite, Kurdish, and
Sunni factions, a major breakthrough in an eight-month political impasse that followed an inconclusive March election.
