Fyi. Still a lot of votes to count, but Dilma is stuck around 46 percent.

Big surprise is Marina Silva, who is holding at 20 percent, considerably above her final polling figures. Marina will finish
first in the DF and second in Rio.

SOURCE
19:17 030ct10 RTRS-Brazil's ruling party sees runoff for Rousseff
   BRASILIA, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Brazil's ruling Workers' Party expects its presidential candidate Dilma Rousseff to fall short
of clinching a first-round victory on Sunday, and she will have to face a runoff against opposition candidate Jose Serra on
Oct. 31, a high-ranking source in the party told Reuters.
  With 53 percent of votes counted, she has got about 44 percent of the valid votes. She would need 50 percent plus
one of the valid votes to avert a runoff. (Reporting by Natuza Nery)
