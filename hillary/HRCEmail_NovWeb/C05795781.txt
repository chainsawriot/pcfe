Martin Luther King, Jr.

Facing the Challenge of a New Age

We have before us the glorious opportunity to inject a new dimension of love into the veins of our civilization.
There is still a voice crying out in terms that echo across the generations, saying: Love your enemies, bless them
that curse you, pray for them that despitefully use you, that you may be the children of your Father which is in
Heaven.

This love might well be the salvation of our civilization. This is why I am so impressed with our motto for the
week, 'Freedom and Justice through Love.' Not through violence; not through hate; no, not even through
boycotts, but through love.

It is true that as we struggle for freedom in America we will have to boycott at times. But we must remember as
we boycott that a boycott is not an end within itself; it is merely a means to awaken a sense of shame within the
oppressor and challenge his false sense of superiority. But the end is reconciliation; the end is redemption; the
end is the creation of the beloved community.
