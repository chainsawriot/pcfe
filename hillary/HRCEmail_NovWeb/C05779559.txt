Cheryl: I don't want to presume anything, but I also don't want to leave a misimpression if other COM jobs are among
the ideas.
There were very specific reasons that I was enthusiastic about Mexico. The most important of those was how well I
know Mexico after 8 years, and being so close by direct flight that even if my family stayed here, I could have seen them
very often. There are obviously very few places similarly workable.

I just don't want people to go to trouble and then seem ungrateful if I can't take it. Thank you so much.
