OVERVIEW/HIGHLIGHTS

•      Libya is undergoing an unprecedented level of upheaval and violence since anti-government protests began on 17
February 2011. The current outlook for the country - with expected effects on its neighbouring states, especially Egypt and
Tunisia - is that the humanitarian situation will continue to deteriorate.

•     WFP Executive Director Josette Sheeran visited the Tunisian border yesterday and appealed to the humanitarian
and donor communities to avert a full-fledged humanitarian crisis in and around Libya.

•    A joint United Nations mission, including WFP members, is being organized to eastern Libya to carry out a
humanitarian needs assessment there.

•      Humanitarian agencies are working in countries bordering with Libya to help ensure that people leaving Libya have
the assistance they require. The situation on the Tunisian side is particularly of concern, in view of the large numbers of
people still arriving there.

•      Libya is a net food importer; potential significant disruptions of the food supply chain are of great concern to WFP.

•      A WFP Programme and Logistics assessment mission is currently deployed in Djerba and the Libyan border. The
mission found that while the local community and the Tunisian Red Cross are handling the situation well, their resources
are running thin.

•     WFP-supplied HEBs that arrived on Monday (80 MT) are being distributed to those stranded at the border, to
complement the efforts of the government and local population.

•     WFP endorsed a regional operation for a value of US$ 38.7 million, with a project document to be approved
tomorrow. WFP will be appealing for this funding to assist )000( million people in Libya, Tunisia and Egypt, under a
Regional Emergency Operation over a period of three months.

•     WFP has diverted a ship carrying 1,182 MT of wheat flour destined for a different operation to Benghazi, to
address the immediate needs there; this ship is expected to reach Benghazi in the next two to three days.

•      Two immediate response emergency projects were already approved earlier and a third one was approved
yesterday, for a total of US$ 1.2 million.

Strictly Internal:

•      UNHCR will be issuing a supplementary appeal for US$ 18 million to cover all the immediate needs that the
organization has already undertaken, while IOM will be asking for US$ 11 million.

•       The Consolidated Appeals Process Section of the UN is meeting to begin the drafting process for an appeal, with

      UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05778340 Date: 11/30/2015
      UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05778340 Date: 11/30/2015




the aim of finalizing the appeal by the end of Friday, 4 March.

•     OCHA noted the availability of CERF funds for the ODC region in light of the current situation. WFP will seek
CERF funding for the regional EMOP under preparation.

•       A joint FAO/WFP Food Security Assessment is planned in Tunisia in the coming couple of weeks.

•      WFP is currently providing logistics support to IOM and the Egyptian Government to charter a boat to transport
displaced Egyptian migrant workers from Tunisia to Egypt.

Strictly Internal: WFP staff in Libya are safe. The Coordinator of WFP Logistics Operations in Libya was successfully
evacuated from Al-Kufra logistics base, in central Libya, to the WFP base in Abeche, Eastern Chad, with the help of
UNHAS.

Population movement/Inter-Agency: According to the information received from OCHA and an interim report of the joint
UN assessment mission that travelled to the Egypt-Libya border crossing of Salloum on 24-27 February, more than
61,000 people have crossed the border into Egypt since 19 February. The majority - 49,000 - were Egyptian migrant
workers who have stayed a relatively short time (a few days at most) in the border area. Out of the non-Egyptians, some
2,100 are Libyan citizens.

Latest reports show that the influx of people from Libya into Egypt has subsided and that most people who came have
proceeded beyond border areas, except for a few hundred people (up to 1,000). UNHCR, WFP and UNICEF discussed
contingency plans for potential activation of assistance in case the influx starts again. At the border crossing into Tunisia,
UNHCR informed on 27 February that 40,000 -50,000 had crossed since 22 February. Some 18,000 are Tunisian, 15,000
Egyptians, 3,500 Libyans and 2,000 Chinese. This border crossing appears to be much more congested than the one into
Egypt. A further 10,000 are believed to have crossed in the past two days. At the border crossing into Niger, IOM informed
that 654 Nigerien nationals have reached their transit facility in Dirkou. These migrants are being assisted to proceed to
Agadez City with a military convoy due to insecurity in northern Niger. The arrival of 432 additional migrants from Libya
was expected Monday in Dirkou. IOM has learned that hundreds of people are willing to leave but remain blocked in
Libya.

Strictly Internal:

Security Reports from organizations in Egypt that managed to access eastern Libya or were in contact with local
counterparts confirm that Benghazi has been calm over the past couple of days. Security on the road from the Egyptian
border to Benghazi is provided by local groups to a large extent. All travel to Tripoli remains suspended by UN Security.
Travel to other areas of the country is subject to clearance by DSS.

Strictly Internal: Inter-Agency

A USAID mission is under way to Marsa Matrouh and Salloum (Egypt) on the border with Libya. The mission intends to
carry out initial discussions with the relevant organizations on the ground including IOM, other UN counterparts,
ICRC/Red Crescent and WFP.

WITHIN LIBYA: Available reports suggest that some form of economic activity is going on in Benghazi, although at a
slower pace than usual. Basic necessities, such as food, are available, but becoming more and more in short supply,
every day. Shops and banks are reportedly open. Mobile and landline phones are working and Internet has returned.

WFP Response: WFP has re-established contact with staff in Benghazi, who confirmed this situation. Furthermore,
contact was also established with the Libyan Red Crescent (LRC) in Benghazi. Within the framework of the immediate
response emergency operation approved yesterday, WFP is discussing a collaborative arrangement with LRC for food
distributions and to use LRC warehouses for storing WFP commodities. WFP is starting to move food into Libya, to assist
the vulnerable people in need there. Relief supplies that can be provided immediately from Egypt to Libya and other
supply chain options are being deployed. WFP has a presence of national staff in Benghazi and Kufra.

FROM THE LIBYA-TUNISIA BORDER:

General Situation: The large number of arrivals and the increasing numbers of non-Tunisian displaced unable to move to
their home country is putting major pressure on the Tunisian Red Crescent (TRC) and local authorities, including the
military, who are making all efforts to cope with this size of the influx. These people are now increasingly accommodated
in temporary shelters, although authorities still try to place families arriving from Libya with local families. Despite the
continued local generosity in providing food and water to arrivals, the situation is placing an increasing strain on the

resident population.

Consignment of 80 MT of HEB is in a warehouse near Djerba airport, which is managed by TRC with the help of
volunteers, including road transport to border. The first two tons were distributed yesterday to people waiting to cross. The
remainder will be distributed, by TRC and volunteers under its coordination, over the next few days in quantities to be
determined by them. A WFP logistics officer is working on the ground to support them.

WFP Programme and Logistics mission currently in Djerba and the Libyan border: Preliminary findings indicate that the
current support provided is impressive — particularly for food, water and shelter — by the local population and civic
organizations.

WFP Logistics is supporting IOM and the Egyptian Government in chartering a boat to transport displaced Egyptian
migrant workers from Tunisia to Egypt. (NOTE from Harriet: WFP/LOGS officials reported that WFP met with MSC and
PRC delegation on transporting Chinese nationals via cruiseship to Malta. IOM intended to do themselves, but were
overwhelmed. END NOTE)

FROM THE LIBYA-EGYPT BORDER:

Strictly Internal: Reports from some organizations suggest that the Government of Egypt (GoE) prefer humanitarian
supplies to be purchased from the local market rather than imported from abroad. In the meantime, there were reports
that the Alexandria airport would no longer process the transit of humanitarian cargo for Libya. The policy of the Egyptian
Government with regards to the importation of humanitarian supplies needs to be further clarified.

WFP Statement
2   March 2011

STATEMENT OF THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
         JOSETTE SHEERAN FROM THE LIBYAN BORDER

On the border of Libya and Tunisia, yesterday, I was surrounded by tens of thousands of people fleeing violence. It is clear
the world must increase humanitarian action to prevent a disaster inside Libya. We call for safe humanitarian access,
especially to western Libya. Cutting off food supplies must not be used as a weapon.

There are two immediate crises WFP is acting on:


     •    The urgent need for food for those fleeing Libya and crossing the borders into Tunisia and Egypt;

     •    The threat to food distribution systems, especially in Libya, where stocks are being depleted, and supply chains
          are disrupted.


I have pledged WFP's support to partner with the Red Crescent and others to help provide food assistance to those fleeing
violence and to prepare for what may be needed in the days and weeks ahead inside Libya.

In response to this regional crisis, we are launching a USD$ 38.7 million emergency operation to provide food assistance
to 2.7 million people in Libya, Egypt and Tunisia. We are planning for a three month emergency operation that will help
shore up Egypt and Tunisian food safety nets and will also purchase food from the region to help ensure that recovery
from the disruption can begin immediately.

As I visited the border area, the first airlift of 8o metric tons of high energy biscuits, flown in by WFP on Monday, were
being distributed at the crossing points. As part of our contingency planning we have also re-routed shipments of wheat
and wheat flour to the Tunisian border and the Libyan port of Benghazi where it will be pre-positioned to meet immediate
humanitarian needs that may arise.

WFP has a strong presence inside Libya and we are currently making assessments that will allow us to quickly direct life
saving food assistance towards those who are most vulnerable. We call upon the world for immediate support for this
appeal.
