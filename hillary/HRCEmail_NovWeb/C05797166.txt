Dear Secretary and friend:

You've been very much on my mind, as I've been seeing a good bit of chelsea (and the President too). I am so relieved
you are ok. You're not only a national and international treasure but also someone we (me, my family) love dearly. Get
well soon. Am so looking fwd to spending time together in the coming year
With love and prayers and faith in your prompt recovery Paul Thank you for the lovely birthday letter! My very best to
huma and cheryl too
