Harold/Kurt:



As you may know, CGC visited the United States about nine years ago as an International Visitor Program
grantee. Attached is the report his escort filed at the conclusion of the one month trip. I thought it might be of
interest to you because you spent so much time with him. Please do not forward.. .km
