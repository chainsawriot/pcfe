Cheryl,
The following letter comes from a very good friend of mine. Coincidentally he is the guy who recommended to OUR
President back in 1991 when he had voice problems, to see a particular doctor as I remember who was in Virginia , Who
solved his problems. So he comes with some credentials.
Follow up or not as you see appropriate.
Hope all is well and I look forward to your visit to NYC some time.

Alan, I think it might be a very good idea for you to transmit the letter set forth below to Hillary on your
personal stationary.

Dear Madam Secretary,
My friend C. Leonard Gordon, whom you have met in East Hampton, is Chairman of the Board of an Israeli
Company, Althera Medical Ltd. ("Althera") that has a patented product, based on an invention at Tel Aviv
University that delivers alpha radiation into tumors on a tiny pin called a DaRT (an acronym for Diffusing
Alpha-emitters Radiation Therapy).

Alpha radiation has been the "holy grail" of radiation for over 50 years. It is more powerful than Beta or
Gamma but, until the invention of the DaRT, it couldn't be beamed into a tumor because it can't penetrate skin,
or even rice paper.

Scientists at TAU have conducted thousands of tests inserting DaRTs into every kind of human tumors
implanted in animals. The radiation bounces off of the DaRTs and diffuses throughout the tumor shrinking it
and killing the cancer cells. The radiation, if it escapes through a break in the skin of the tumor, can't travel
more than a millimeter or two in healthy tissue. The DaRTs are ready for human clinical testing as shown by
the Press Release attached to this letter.

Len suggested you might send a copy of my letter and its attached press release to President Hugo Chavez to have
his doctors review the safety, efficacy and possible applicability of DaRTs for treatment of President Chavez's
cancer. It is a more powerful, safer radiation treatment of his cancer then he received in Cuba and it is easier to
deliver. No lead lined rooms or big equipment is needed, nor is there any need to go to Cuba for the treatment. His
doctors could insert the DaRTs in Venezuela.

We think that Steve Jobs might be alive today if DaRTs had been available to him. Alther is prepared to make
DaRTs available to President Chavez's Doctors in Venezuela for examination testing and for treatment of
President Chavez. They can be shipped by air, loaded with precise dosage of alpha radiation required to be
effective for 4 days. The radiation loses power and is finished in approximately 20 days. The DaRT could be
removed but need not be.

Professor Benjamin Corn, Chairman of Radiation Oncology at the Sourasky Medical Center and Althera's Chief
Medical Officer who will lead the clinical testing in Israel would be available to review the feasibility of such
treatment with President Chavez's doctors in Venezuela. President Chavez's doctors are the ones qualified to
determine if the treatment is advisable.

As Secretary of State you may not agree with some of President Chavez's policies, but you have shown most
recently that your value of human beings drives your political actions.

Your office can contact Leonard at                                  and at Althera USA's head office in B6
Harlem at 1400 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10026. His phone number is               and his cell number is


With best wishes always
Alan
