Conservative Group Pushes for Ratification of the 'Law of Sea' Treaty

Posted on October 3, 2012 at 4:23pm by Becket Adams

In a somewhat surprising turn of events conservative advocacy group Institute for Liberty came out in support of the
decades-old "Law of the Sea," an international treaty regulating use of the world's oceans.

On Tuesday, the conservative group released the following video:

"The Institute for Liberty has given a great deal of thought about the Law of the Sea Treaty, since our opposition earlier
in the year, and we hope that this video helps to spur people to rethink their opposition," said Institute for Libery
President Andrew Langer in an email to TheBlaze.

He added, "On balance, we see the continued stalling of the treaty as a direct threat to American exceptionalism — and
base our position on principles near and dear to conservatives and libertarians from around the country. The treaty
promotes investment, advances private property rights, works to keep our nation safe, and prevents us from losing
ground to our economic and political rivals."
