Madam Secretary,
Just arrived back in DC from India, Afghanistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgystan. Good trip and will have note to you on
Monday. Some progress I think with Atambayev on Transit Center at Manas. Know you leave tomorrow. Will swap notes
with Bill who also goes on road next week but feel free to call if anything you want to make sure is covered.
Wendy
