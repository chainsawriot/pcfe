 Hi there. August 15th works better for me. I guess the question is do you want to. have the whole group meet
 ie: the President of the Association of Society of Clinical Oncologists, Executive Director of Association of
 Black Cardiologists, Department of Health Representatives, as well as our own School of Public Health and of
 course faculty and Chelsea's friend

 Let me know.

 Afternoon would be better.

 Thanks, Gigi
