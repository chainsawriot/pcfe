Subject: Afghanistan/Women - Following Up

Joe â€” per this morning's request at the 0845, could you please pass to the Secretary that we went back and
combed through Rajiv Chandrasekaran's latest book, Little America: The War Within the War for Afghanistan
and found no quotes (anonymous or otherwise) on women rights. Book's focus is on COIN failures and war
cabinet politics. Where development is discussed, it is a dam project, an agriculture project, and bureaucratic
issues in connecting with Afghans. That said, it is quite possible that in one of the press appearances Rajiv did
promoting his book, he referred to some unnamed officials who said women's rights were not a priority. We
are doing a broader search and will forward if we run across any such references. Mike
