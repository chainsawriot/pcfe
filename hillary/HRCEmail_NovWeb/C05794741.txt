I received an invitation to the Kindle event you will be doing with Jeff Bezos next week and I am planning on
being there. This initiative was a key part of our overall objective of finding new and innovative ways to
provide people in all sectors and all levels of society with access to the tools and resources they need to learn
more about the United States. No doubt some of the "old guard" will grumble about the program and continue
to express their desire to see us build new libraries. Obviously that is just not in the cards these days but even if
we had the financial resources to put libraries everywhere we would still need to embrace the tools of the
digital age if we want to connect with a younger demographic. I've encourage the team there to provide you
with talking points about how we selected Kindle over the other devices so that you are prepared for any
questions you might get about Apple, Nook, etc. This initiative also provides a great example of private-public
sector cooperation. Kindle really worked with us to make it happen in terms of modifying their systems to
handle the complexities of working with the USG. No small feat! Let me know if you need any more info.

On another note, I've had a number of interesting discussions about the issue of women's leadership with a guy
named Mark Gallogly. Not sure if you know him. He was one of the founders of Blackstone and then started
Centerbridge Partners where he is Managing Principal. Among other things he is trying to figure out ways to get
more women into leadership roles in the financial sector. Very thoughtful. You might want to meet with him at
some point once you are back in NY.

See you next week.
