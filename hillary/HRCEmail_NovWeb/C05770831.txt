--Things are heating up even more, based on our SITREP 1 sent in earlier and news reports of Turks massing in the main
Istanbul square.

--Fact that most of the dead apparently were Turkish, and all killed/injured on one Turkish ship, has really heated
passions here. Pictures show Israeli soldiers firing/aiming rifles next to Turkish flags, etc.

--We thus have the 'perfect storm' for bad news with Turkey (not that we don't have enough friction in any case): a
volatile mix of nationalism and religious identity, with a government with a record of deliberately exploiting these
factors—the Davos incident.

--Davutoglu supposedly is enroute to New York to summon security council for an emergency session.

--I have been summoned along with all other Security Council Ambassadors to the MFA at 1500 local, 0800 EST, to hear
the GOT position on this.

--Turks will undoubtedly demand a statement from us condemning the Israeli actions—already have heard that from U/S
Sinirlioglu.




--That said, after we get more information I'll report classified on what might be behind all of this from the Turkish
side.
