Subject: Condolences from 41 Netanyahu

Prime Minister Netanyahu called me tonight and asked me to pass on to President Obama, Secretary Clinton, and the
families of those we lost in Libya his and the Israeli people's most profound condolences. He said Israelis know too well
how difficult these moments are, and he wanted us all to know that Israelis stand shoulder-to-shoulder with us at such a
difficult time.

Please pass this up your chains of command. Thank you.

Dan
