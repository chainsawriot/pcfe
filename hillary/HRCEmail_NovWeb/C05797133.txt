Dear Madame Secretary,



Thank you so much for the opportunity to work at WHA with 100,000 Strong. I so appreciate the chance to
team up with a great group and launch an effort which will have long term impact. As you may have heard, we
have joined with Partners of the Americas and NAFSA... so that the initiative will have a sustained and
productive life. Steve Vetter of Partners described how you had worked with Partners in Arkansas to establish
student exchanges in Latin America. It is so fitting that we now build on that experience.



 I was in Mexico City two weeks ago as part of your effort to increase the number of women businesses who
can access contracts from corporations and government. People were so enthusiastic...again thanks to your
leadership. Funny, the IBM representative told me that my father had started a similar program with IBM for
minority businesses in 1968!



About ten days ago, I had lunch with Vince Panvini of the Sheet Metal Workers---where we sang your praises,
recalled old campaigns and dreamt of another one!!



I know you hope for some rest---well deserved. Then, I look forward to joining another effort to take you to
your rightful place!!



With all good wishes and great gratitude,
