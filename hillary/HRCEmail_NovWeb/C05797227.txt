Dear Cheryl,

Thought you and HRC might appreciate the tribute below. It is from Rich Galen, a former aide
to Newt who also advised Bremer in Iraq. If Hillary has won Galen over, she has truly
changed the world! Congratulations on a job well done. Please let me know if I can ever be
of assistance.

Your friend and fan,

Paulie

She wouldn't remember me if she were hypnotized, but if you happen to have the opportunity to
communicate with Sec. Clinton today, please tell her how much I have appreciated her service
as First Lady, Senator, and
Secretary.   As far as I'm concerned she has been a true American hero.

Rich.
