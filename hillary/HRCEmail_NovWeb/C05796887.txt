  Dear SetsTy•Cri)n,

  It is with relief that I welcome the news that you are out of the hospital and on the mend to a full recovery. You gave all of us a
  scare.. ..and this is the best possible news, now and for the future.

  May I take a moment as well to say that it continues to be a pleasure and a privilege to work with you as Secretary of State. You
  have provided tremendous leadership, vision and support especially in the areas of gender, MENA, and open government, all
  issues in which the OECD's work has achieved real traction and impact. Thank you.

  I personally, and the OECD institutionally, deeply value our relationship.

  With all best wishes for the new year to you and to your family.



                                                            Yours sincerely,




                                                              Angel Gurria

  Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton
  Secretary of State
