             Chief of Staff
             Office of the Secretary

             Dear Cheryl,

             Some time ago, Secretary Clinton and I had a good conversation about the
             importance of reinstating the Special Envoy for the Americas position I was
             so privileged to,hold during our time together in the Clinton administration.

             I've written her today regarding the possibility rorf moving forward with that
             initiative, and naming               to the role, I believe that       brings a
             valuable range of expertise, from his time in the state house to his fluency in
             Spanishâ€”and I am confident that 'a dedicated, high-level person in this role
             can be an asset to the secretary and the president, not only in keeping our
             hemispheric relations on track, but in advancing the broader foreign policy
             and national security agenda on issues from trade to climate change and
             beyond.

             I would ber grateful if you could ensure my letter receives her attention.

             Thank you as always for your service and for your leadership. Donna joins
             me in sending our best wishes.


                                                    Personally;
