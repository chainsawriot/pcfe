On Tuesday morning the Senate will first have the cloture vote on the Cr. We will get cloture and then ask them to yield
back time and vote on final passage of the Cr. We do expect them to yield back some time (how much is unclear) as the
govt shut down will occur tues at midnight. Following disposal of the Cr, we will have the cloture vote on START. As we
get a better sense on timing of the START cloture vote during the day on tues, I will be sure to let Huma and Lona know
in case there is a chance you can come by. The vote on ratification will either be very late on wed or on thurs am,
depending on whether the Republicans will yield back time.

Wyden is the only Dem expected to miss the ratification vote, but that doesn't change the number of Rs we need. Still
need 9, as its 2/3rds of those present (that would be 66 if everyone except Wyden were there).

We are still working on a fairly complex missile defense amendment from Corker and McCain, but I am hopeful we can
work something out short of yet another understanding in the Resolution of Ratification, which will put further pressure
on the Russians to retaliate. So we are trying very hard to come up with a condition or non-binding declaration. Will
keep you posted.

Finally, believe we are ready for the closed session - Feinstein, Kerry and Lugar are well briefed up.

This all sounds very promising. Do you know what time they'll vote on Tuesday? I'd like to be there. Are Kerry and
Feinstein fully briefed on everything? Will Lugar help too?
