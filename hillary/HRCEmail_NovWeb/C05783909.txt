Hi Cheryl,

Marc Grossman is sending up an appointment request for the Secretary to do a farewell call with Karl
Eikenberry, during which he'd like the Secretary to make a surprise presentation of the Distinguished Honor
Award (i.e. the one WITHOUT the gold medal), which I expect the Department's awards committee to approve
in the next week.



Thanks,

Steve
