Subject: Update

Just received the following information from British colleague:

British PM talked to Algerian PM who confirmed there was an planned intervention at the BP site. He mentioned some
of the capturers were killed and injured, some x-pats managed to escape, and there is a possibility of fatalities among
the hostages. The situation is still very fluid so we do not have any confirmed numbers or nationalities. I will update as I
receive information.
