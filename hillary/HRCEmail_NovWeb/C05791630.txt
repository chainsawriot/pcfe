Subject: Thank you re: Secretary Clinton Meeting yesterday with Bishop Elias Taban

Cheryl,
Just want to thank Secretary Clinton for reaching out and meeting yesterday with Bishop Elias Taban. The
importance of Sudanese voices being at the forefront of the peace process cannot be understated and the fact
that Secretary Clinton reached out to the Bishop is evidence that she values those voices. Oxfam has been
working with Bishop Taban in the US on the importance of securing an Arms Trade Treaty and we worked with
him to place his wonderful op-ed on S Sudan in the NYT - so you can imagine how excited we are that he was
able to meet with the Secretary and express his very important views.
Best,

Linda Amerigo Delgado
Director of Government Affairs
Oxfam America
