Cheryl,

Per our prior discussions I would like to attend the morning mtgs w S and was hoping to start that practice this coming
week if you agree.

I fully understand the confidentiality issue and will manage that issue super carefully.

I also have thought through my prior request for a little office space on the 7th floor and some focused support from
Caitlin/Steve. While I still think those things would be helpful, it feels less urgent and we could try my joining the
morning meeting and then explore the issue of space etc...

Are you comfortable starting this on monday? I would be changing my morning mtgs at AID so wanted to get going w
this.

Thanks,
Raj
