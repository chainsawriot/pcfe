Subject: John Kerry speaks on climate



If you haven't heard John Kerry's speech on climate crisis, here it is. So very compelling and sobering, ( on

         (UNCSD), Senator John Kerry (D-Mass.), Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee,
         delivered a major floor speech urging U.S. action to combat the threat of global climate change.
