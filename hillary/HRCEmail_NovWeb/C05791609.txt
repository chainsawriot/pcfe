Subject: Belarus expels Sweden's ambassador (AP)



STOCKHOLM (AP) - Sweden's foreign minister says Belarus has expelled its ambassador 'for being too
supportive of human rights.'
  Carl Bildt says Sweden in turn has decided that the incoming Belarusian ambassador to Sweden won't be
welcome. He also says two Belarusian diplomats have been asked to leave the Nordic country.
  Bildt, who spoke to reporters August 3, says Belarus' authoritarian government, headed by President
Alexander Lukashenko, got upset because the Swedish ambassador had met with the opposition in Minsk.
  The expulsion also comes weeks after a pair of Swedish activists used a light plane to drop hundreds of teddy
bears bearing messages supportive of human rights into Belarusian territory.
  Lukashenko fired two generals over the incident. Bildt, however, said there was no word that the teddy bear
dropped was linked to the expulsion.
