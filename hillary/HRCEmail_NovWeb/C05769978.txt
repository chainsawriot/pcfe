Subject: Arghandab District Governor Killed

Frank Ruggiero reports that Arghandab District Governor Jabar and one of his sons was killed in a suicide bomb in
Kandahar City near the Governor's palace. The Governor will work with the IDLG on a contingency plan on who steps up
to fill his shoes. Jabar was a good partner for us who has helped stabilize Arghandab, and has met most of our senior
Embassy officials and many codels traveling to Arghandab. This attack coupled with the Nagahan bombing (wedding
attack) of a couple nights ago confirms reports that the Taliban intend to step up attacks in Kandahar in anticipation of
Ham kari.
