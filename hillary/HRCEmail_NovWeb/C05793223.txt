He needs to appeal to M as a pragmatist. As you noted, he can comiserate to a certain extent.

Four messages:

He can afford to give some ground on the constitutional declaration - and he can't afford not to.

He needs urgently to get his supporters to disengage from street fights - that's a recipe for disaster if it continues.

There are reasonable people, like El Baradei and Moussa, who he can work with to find a path forward.

People need to feel like they are being heard and included, so some kind of inclusive process is urgently needed, or the
polarization will only grow.
