But as discussed, here is the answer to McCain's question about funneling more $ through the SOC

   -   The SOC is a very new organization -- midwifed by Ambassador Ford only a few short months ago. We've been
       working closely with it to develop its capacity to help direct humanitarian assistance.

   -   We're also coming to terms with it on direct assistance for the organization -- supporting staff salaries and
       overhead, for instance. And we're trying to coordinate with its assistance arm — the Assistance Support Unit
       — on an assistance shipment to Aleppo, in addition to other aid.

   -   It's a work in progress, but we are in fact making much progress in a short time. The larger problem is that the
       needs are just overwhelming.
