Jake:

Per our conversation yesterday, here's the note I sent to Cheryl on Monday. Cheryl also asked me
about                                        I'd be eager for the chance to discuss each of these
with you both. I'm off to South Asia on Sunday night for a week, but can speak tonight, this weekend,
on the road, when I return, or whenever. I'm also happy to expand on this for you both and/or the
Secretary.

In short, PRM needs a dynamic leader who had the confidence of the Secretary, who knows
humanitarian assistance and how it fits into larger foreign policy issues, and who knows how
government operates.

Why? Because we've worked so hard to ensure that PRM is - and must remain - a poster child for
what the Secretary is trying to accomplish with QDDR: it's a bureau that integrates its assistance
(about $1.8 billion last year) and operations (with 28 refugee coordinator offices overseas) with U.S.
diplomacy, and leverages the latter with the former. Moreover, while we must continue to enhance
State's operational capacity, many hundreds of foreign service officers have already had
considerable operational experience working as U.S. refugee (and humanitarian) coordinators
throughout the world.

Best,
Eric

Again, I'm so glad you asked.

The Bureau -- whose leadership has suffered in the past -- must have an Assistant Secretary who is dynamic,
knows the workings of government and the field of humanitarianism, and enjoys the Secretary's confidence. It
is so critical, because, more than perhaps any other place in the Department, the Bureau is where so many of the
operational objectives of the Secretary in QDDR are playing out, day-in and day-out — with dozens of refugee
officers overseas coordinating closely with PRM and regional bureaus in Washington.

There are several stellar individuals. This is a first cut, and I hope you'll give me the chance to come in with
others if I think of more. How great it would be to have someone in place when I leave.

Any of these would be top choices. If you want me to rank them, best to do by phone. But on a 1 — 10 scale,
they are all about a 9.
