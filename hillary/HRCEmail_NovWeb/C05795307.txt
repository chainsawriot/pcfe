This is the one we love best. Your expression and hand on your heart make it so genuine, and President Clinton has a
great expression. Just a wonderful connection.


There's nothing to do about the sandwich and the clutter, they're in every shot. Makes it real.


It's barely 6am at home but hopefully Hurna will be able to take a look too. I'm on the clock because want the morning
shows to use it. That's an hour from now.

The network identification has been scrubbed, for a few reasons. 1) don't want to that network to take this as an
endorsement 2) the other networks won't use it 3) it's the heinous MSNBC and I just can't bring myself to give them that
satisfaction. Obviously I'd be completely transparent & forthright about it. Not worried about that part.
