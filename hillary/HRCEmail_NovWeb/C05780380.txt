I just had another thought. She is a unique FS0 but an FSO nonetheless - which means she will be conscious of her place
in the heirarchy. She is not ranked as high as people like                and many others who have to implement. She
might think the role puts her career at risk.

She'd be really good at that job. The strongest qualities she has are planning and the ability to realize/implement plans
with a focus on results. Tons of energy and drive - like energizer bunny.
The knowledge she lacks is organizational change but someone else could bring that. Also, she has a reputation for a
strong personality and some glass breaking. I view this as a strength but there may be a few people whose toes she has
stepped on in past. But not enough to make her ineffective.

I think she'd be even better at CSO but that may not be on the table.

Cheryl,

         mentioned yesterday that she was going to be speaking with you about the QDDR. She was on the list I sent to
you many months ago of potential CSO assistant secretaries. I'm not sure if she would accept such a position but she
would be great. She's an unusual FS0 with great credibility among agencies and a strong personality. And other good
qualities that would be great for CSO that I won't list here.

Hope you're doing well!
Best,
Karen
