Cheryl

A quick note of thanks for including Laurent and me among the Haiti delegation. It was such. a good experience for both
of us and really helped solidify their interest and, hopefully, will fast track their plans. Loads of new relationships and
connections.

Huge congratulations, I hope you are proud of what you have accomplished. I know there is so much more to do but we
don't often take a minute to recognize how extraordinary our accomplishments are. I hope you do!

Many thanks. Hope to see you soon. Want to sit and talk with you about post Jan!
