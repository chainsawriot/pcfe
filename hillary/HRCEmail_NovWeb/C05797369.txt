Dear Cheryl:

I want to let you know that January 22" will be my last day at the Department of State. I have accepted a
position as Executive Director of the House Democratic Caucus, serving under the leadership of Congressman
Xavier Becerra, who was recently elected Chairman of the Caucus and I will begin my new job on January
25th. There are three people in Washington that I cannot say "no" to: my son, Hillary Clinton and Xavier. It
has been a real honor to have had the opportunity to serve under Secretary Clinton's leadership, and I'm
particularly grateful for the support I received from you to become the DAS for Public Diplomacy in the Bureau
of Western Hemisphere Affairs. This has been an amazing opportunity to help people in the Americas and the
Caribbean understand better what America is about, and to create new ways of helping them improve their
lives. I know you are a very busy woman, so I won't write a long email, though I have a lot to say about how
much I enjoyed this job. Just wanted to send you a note with all my gratitude for your support and for having
me allowed to join the Hillary team once again.
