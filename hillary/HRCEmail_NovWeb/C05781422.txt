Subject: Nima's training at Ops

Alice â€”


Nima is finishing up his training at Ops today and I wanted to tell you how thoroughly impressed we have been. The
consistent feedback from the team is that Nima is extraordinarily sharp, has superb judgment and is supercool under
pressure. Folks also commented on the fact that he is also a really nice guy.


We trained him on the functions at Ops with which he is likely to have the most contact in his role on S staff. We also
worked with him on further developing multitasking skills and maintaining good situational awareness of events around
him even as he concentrates on the tasks in front of him. He did not need much help.


You all have chosen wisely, Nima is terrific. Though on loan, he has established himself as a member of the Ops team
and we are looking forward to working with him when he joins S staff.
