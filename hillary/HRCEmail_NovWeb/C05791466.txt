Subject: RE: International Day of the Girl Child / Archbishop Tutu

Dear Melanne,


When a saw Graca Machel a few weeks ago, she mentioned that she plans to raise the issue of child marriage.
Please find attached a note on ending child marriage in Sub-Saharan Africa that has been prepared for
Secretary Clinton by the Graga Machel Trust and Girls Not Brides.



Please let me know whether there is anything that we can do to help prepare for the meeting â€” including
anything that we should mention beforehand to Graca Machel.

Amy news on the Day of the Girl Child?

Abrazo, Mabel
