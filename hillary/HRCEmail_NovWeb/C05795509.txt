support. Have set up a foundation to support him, hired attorneys and producing legal memoranda
                                                                                                                       B1
                                                                                                                       1.4(D)

Gene, I wonder if it might be possible to give you a call sometime today. The government of Bangladesh has taken action
against Mohammed Yunus and the Grameen Bank that will affect its independence and more. Harassment has been
going on for many months and we and others around the globe have raised concerns, but the GOB appears bound and
determined to make changes. This has now come to a head with the government's action regarding the selection of the
successor to Yunus.                                                                                               B1
                                                                                                                  1.4(D)

I hope you and Carol are having a nice summer.
