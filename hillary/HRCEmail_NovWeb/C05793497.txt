Linda Alvarado (first woman to own a construction company), Maria Pepe (first girl to integrate Little League), Mann
Alsop (first female conductor), and Katherine Switzer (first woman to run in the Boston Marathon).

The MAKERS site which launched at the end of February, has been seen over 12 million unique visitors and has had 30
million video views. Over 47% of their audience is men. PBS are now in the final stages of production on a wider
documentary which will air in February 2013 and tell the definitive story of the modern American Women's
Movement. To support the initiative, PBS has lined up a broad educational and community outreach campaign that
includes schools across the country and a "local MAKER" initiative to record community stories through the local PBS
member stations. In addition, AOL is promoting the MAKERS series on their homepage, sponsoring events around the
country, and have launched a taxi campaign with the videos in 7 markets.
