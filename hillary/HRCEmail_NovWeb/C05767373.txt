Subject: Food Security




I wanted to touch base because I know Jeanne, Raj and I had great conversations with you about assuming the
diplomacy portfolio and providing leadership for the Food Security effort commencing 1 March.

While we haven't spoken in the interim, a number of your colleagues have expressed deep reservations at your
departure prior to your scheduled June transition date. That is a wonderful testament to the great job you are doing
there.

In light of those concerns, which reach from Deputy Secretary Lew to the Ambassador Hill and across the board with the
military, we obviously will respect the need for you to stay i   and continue your critical mission.

When you transition in June, if there are still needs that we have as we staff up the Food Security operation, we look
forward to connecting with you to explore whether there is a match between our needs and your interests.

All the best to you.
