Cheryl

Because it's that kind of day and that kind of week:

1. Sae-A shipped the first 65,000 shirts 'Made in Haiti' that should hit Walmart stores soon. They now employ a 1,000
workers, many trained by a USG-financed training center.

2. Only two mango trees had to be uprooted at the Caracol Park. Trees under threat are now being transplanted to the
Caracol Ekam housing.

3. MarteIly invited Preval to the opening ceremony.

4. Richard Branson will visit Haiti on the 21-22, staying in a beautiful cottage by the sea.

Best, JL
