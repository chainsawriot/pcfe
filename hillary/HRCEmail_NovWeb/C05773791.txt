Clinton calls for pragmatic action at Rio+ 20 enviro summit

By Associated Press, Updated: Friday, June 22, 1:10 PM



RIO DE JANEIRO â€” U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for pragmatic steps to solve global

environmental problems and promote sustainable development on Friday, urging leaders attending the

Rio+ 20 summit to partner with private-sector groups to make progress on a wide range of issues.



Clinton's address came during the final day of the development summit, the largest meeting the United

Nations has yet organized. The gathering has come under withering criticism from activists for what they say

is the unambitious final document all nations agreed upon to put the globe on a sustainable path, promoting

economic growth that doesn't devour natural resources.



"In the 21st century, the only viable development is sustainable development. The only way to deliver lasting

progress for everyone is by preserving our resources and protecting our common environment," Clinton said

during a speech before delegates from 19 2 other nations.

She added later in the speech: "We know that we will be judged not by what we say nor even by what we

intend to do, but by whether we deliver results for people alive today, and whether we keep faith with future

generations."



Upward of 50,000 people participated in the Rio+20 event. Beyond official government delegations, there

were thousands of people from every sector imaginable, from Latin American indigenous groups to Asian

women rights' proponents to corporations teaming up with celebrities to tout their environmentally friendly

proposals.



Additionally, Rio hosted a parallel "People's Summit" of non-governmental organizations and others who

called for more radical and progressive action on the environment and development issues.



Despite the numbers, there was little energy around this year's summit. Going in, expectations were

extremely low for any major advances, to the point that delegates' ability to agree on what critics called a

watered - down final document that mostly reaffirmed what was agreed to in 1992 was viewed as a successful

outcome by governments.



Activists were not impressed.



"Rio will go down as the hoax summit. They came, they talked, but they failed to act," said Barbara Stocking,

chief executive of Oxfam. "We elect governments to tackle the issues that we can't tackle alone. But they are

not providing the leadership the world desperately needs."



Jim Leape, director of WWF, said that the "formal negotiations were by any measure a huge disappointment."



"Governments didn't find a way to come together. There is a lot in the text about 'acknowledging problems'

and 'encouraging countries to act,' but very little commitments. That falls way short of what is needed," he

said.



Brazil's Environment Minister Izabella Teixeira defended the work of governments and like many officials said

that any multilateral process involving 193 nations is going to be a grinding negotiation that will leave most

parties equally unsatisfied.

"The ending document doesn't meet all of Brazil's ambitions ... but I'm certain that it's the best agreement we

could come to," she said.



During her brieftstop in Rio, Clinton on Friday announced some U.S. initiatives, including an agreement to

partner with more than 400 companies to support their efforts to eliminate deforestation from their supply

chains by 2020, and $20 million in government grants to jumpstart clean energy projects in Africa and

support private investment.
