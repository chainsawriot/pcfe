Subject:                          Timing of Commitment to the PA



Rob Goldberg has the paperwork in train so that we will be able to transfer funds by the end of October. I know that
you are not inclined to commit the full $150 mm anyway, which is good, since until the CR is final we need to leave some
room for the CR level to change. You can feel free to make a verbal commitment even now for a partial transfer,
certainly on the order of $50-75 mm, at the end of October. In all likelihood we would be able to do more, and we will
know for sure when the CR is completed later today or tomorrow. I will ask Rob to send you a note as soon as the CR is
final so you know the exact limits.
