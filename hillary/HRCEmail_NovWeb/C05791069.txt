   I I NTRODUCTI ON
             This publication is the 29th annual Report to the Congress on Voting Practices in the United Nations. It
   is submitted in accordance with Section 406 of Public Law 101-246. This law provides, in relevant part:
             "The Secretary of State shall transmit to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Chairman
   of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate a full and complete annual report which assesses for the
   preceding calendar year, with respect to each foreign country member of the United Nations, the voting
   practices of the governments of such countries at the United Nations, and which evaluates General Assembly
   and Security Council actions and the responsiveness of those governments to United States policy on issues of
   special importance to the United States."
             This report reviews voting practices in the UN Security Council and the 66th General Assembly
   (UNGA) in calendar year 2011, and presents data in a variety of formats. All Security Council resolutions for
   the calendar year are described, and voting on them is tabulated (Section II). The report also statistically
   measures the overall voting of UN member states at the 66th General Assembly in Fall 2011 in comparison with
   the U.S. voting record (Section III). It also lists and describes UNGA resolutions selected as particularly
   important to U.S. interests (Section IV), and lists these important votes again with tables for regional and
   political groupings (Section V). It then presents the voting patterns on General Assembly resolutions relating to
   Israel and opposed by the United States (Section VI).
             The Security Council and the General Assembly deal with a full spectrum of issues — including
   threats to peace and security, disarmament, economic and social development, humanitarian relief, and human
   rights — that are considered critical to U.S. interests. A country's behavior at the United Nations is always
   relevant to its bilateral relationship. Nevertheless, a country's voting record in the United Nations is only one
   dimension of its relations with the United States. Bilateral economic, strategic, and political issues are at times
   more directly important to U.S. interests. Our embassies use the pertinent information in this report when
   engaging their host countries.

   FORMAT AND METHODOLOGY
            The format and presentation of this report are consistent with provisions of Public Law 101-246 as
   amended by Public Law 108-447, and the methodology employed is the same as that used since the report's
   inception.
            The tables in this report provide a measurement of the voting coincidence of UN member countries
   with the United States. However, readers are cautioned about interpreting voting coincidence percentages. In
   Section III (General Assembly Overall Votes), Section IV (General Assembly Important Votes and Consensus
   Actions), and the Annex, the percentages in the column of the tables titled "votes only," are calculated using
   only votes on which both the United States and the other country in question voted Yes or No; not included are
   those instances when either country abstained or was absent. Abstentions and absences are often difficult to
   interpret, but they make a mathematical difference, sometimes significant, in the percentage results. The
   inclusion of the number of abstentions and absences in the tables of this report enables the reader to consider
   them in calculating voting coincidence percentages.
             The percentages in column of the table titled "including consensus" offer another perspective on
   General Assembly activity. These figures, by presenting the percentage of voting coincidence with the United
   States after including consensus resolutions as additional identical votes, more accurately reflect the extent of
   cooperation and agreement in the General Assembly. Since not all states are equally active at the United
   Nations, the report credits to each country a portion of the 186 consensus resolutions based on its participation
   in the 95 recorded Plenary votes. Each country's participation rate was calculated by dividing the number of
   Yes/No/Abstain votes it cast in the Plenary (i.e., the number of times it was not absent) by the total number of

       Plenary votes). However, this calculation assumes, for want of an attendance record, that all countries were
       present or absent for consensus resolutions in the same ratio as for recorded votes.
                Questions about this report may be directed to the Bureau of International Organization Affairs in the
       Department of State.



       II SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS
                Security Council membership in 2011 consisted of the five permanent members — China, France,
       Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States — and 10 non-permanent members: Bosnia-Herzegovina,
       Brazil, Colombia, Gabon, Germany, India, Lebanon, Nigeria, Portugal, and South Africa. The following table
       summarizes the activity of the Security Council for the year and compares it with the previous 10 years.

                In 2011, the Security Council adopted all but two of 68 resolutions it considered. It again was heavily
       engaged in efforts to resolve conflicts, and to give direction to UN peacekeeping missions. Much of the
       Security Council's attention continued to focus on Africa and the Middle East.

       RESOLUTIONS
                Substantive resolutions formally considered by the Security Council during the year are listed and
       described below. They are organized alphabetically by topic, and, within each topic, by date. Each listing
       provides the number of the resolution, date of the vote, voting results (Yes-No-Abstain), a brief description, and
       associated Internet resources.

                In 2011, two draft resolutions were vetoed. In February, the United States vetoed a draft resolution
       that would have condemned Israeli settlement activity. In October, China and Russia vetoed a draft resolution
       condemning human rights violations in Syria. For each resolution, mention is made when a negative vote or
       abstention is cast.

      III GENERAL ASSEMBLY: OVERALL VOTES
       VOTING COINCIDENCE WITH THE UNITED STATES
               This section contains a table of the Plenary votes that were recorded at the Fall session of the 66th UN
      General Assembly. In those 95 Plenary votes, the United States voted Yes 38 times (40 percent) and No 47
      times (49.5 percent); it abstained on 10 votes (10.5 percent). It was not absent for any vote.
               All General Assembly members voted during the session. Only Israel voted No in Plenary more often
      (51 times), but the United States voted No by itself only once — on Resolution 21: Prohibition of the
      development and manufacture of new types of weapons of mass destruction and new systems of such weapons:
      report of the Conference on Disarmament. (In 2010 the United States did not vote No in isolation on any
      resolution, after doing so once in 2009 and 16 times in 2008.)
               The United States voted No with three other countries on two resolutions: with France, Israel, and the
      United Kingdom on Resolution 66/22; and with India, Israel, and Pakistan on a preliminary vote for Resolution
      66/40.
               The United States voted No with two other countries twice: with Israel and the United Kingdom on
      Resolutions 66/90 and 66/91.
               The United States voted No with one other country three times: each time was with Israel, on
      Resolutions 66/6, 66/83, and 66/186.
               On non-consensus issues, i.e., those on which a vote was taken, the average overall General Assembly
      voting coincidence of all UN members with the United States in 2010 was 51.5 percent. This was 9.9
      percentage points above the 2010 figure of 41.6 percent. (In 2009 the voting coincidence rate was 39 percent;
      in 2008, the figure was 25.6 percent; in 2007 it was 18.3 percent.)
               When consensus resolutions are factored in as votes identical to those of the United States, a much
      higher measure of agreement with U.S. positions is reached — 85.9 percent, up slightly from 85.4 percent in
      2010 and 84.3 percent in 2009.

      TABLES SHOWING COMPARISON WITH U.S VOTES
               The tables that follow are based on the 85 instances the United States voted either Yes or No in
      Plenary. Columns show the number of times the United States and the pertinent country cast identical (Yes/Yes
      or No/No) and opposite (Yes/No or No/Yes) votes, as well as the number of times a country abstained or was
      absent for these 85 votes. Voting coincidence percentages are derived by dividing the number of identical votes
      by the total of identical plus opposite votes, the same method used in all previous editions of this report. The
      column headed "Voting Coincidence (Including Consensus)" presents the percentage of voting coincidence
      with the United States after including consensus resolutions as additional identical votes. Extent of
      participation was also factored in (see Introduction: Format and Methodology).

                All countries are listed alphabetically.
       Key:
       Votes Only = Coincidence percentage only for the 85 GA votes where the United States voted Yes or No.
       Votes + Consensus = Coincidence Percentage for the 85 GA votes where the United States voted Yes or No
       plus a pro-rated portion of all consensus resolutions.

      I V - GENERAL ASSEM BLY: I M PORTANT VOTES
      AND CONSENSUSACTI ONS
                Public Law 101-246 calls for analysis and discussion of "votes on issues which directly affected
      United States interests and on which the United States lobbied extensively." An important basis for identifying
      issues is their consistency with the State Department's Strategic Goals. For the 66th UN General Assembly
      (UNGA) in 2011, 10 votes and nine consensus resolutions were identified for inclusion in this section.
                Section IV contains four parts: (1) a listing and description of the 10 important UNGA votes; (2) a
      listing and description of the nine important UNGA consensus resolutions; (3) voting coincidence percentages
      with the United States on these important actions that were adopted by votes, arranged alphabetically by
      country (with each country's overall coincidence rate from Section III listed alongside the rate for important
      votes).; and (4) voting coincidence percentages by UN regional groups and other important groups for nine of
      the 10 important votes.

      IMPORTANT VOTES
                The following 10 important votes are identified by title, resolution number, date of vote, and results
      (Yes-No-Abstain), with the U.S. vote noted. For each vote, a short description of the issue and U.S. policy
      considerations is provided. Where available, hyperlinks to additional explanatory material, as well as official
      U.S. statements, are provided. The resolutions are listed chronologically. Full texts of all resolutions can or
      will be found on the United Nations website, at:Ihttp://www.un.org/documents/resga.htmt In the left-hand
      column, all resolutions are listed numerically. Where underscored, resolution numbers are linked to their texts.
      (Some resolutions were not yet linked by the submission date of this report.)

      1.       U.S. Embargo of Cuba

               The United States imposed a trade and financial transaction embargo on Cuba in 1960, because of
      Fidel Castro's repressive policies and expropriation of U.S. property without compensation. The United States
      strengthened the embargo in 1962, 1992, and 1996. UNGA has adopted a resolution condemning this embargo
      every year since 1992.

                This resolution deplored a plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States, and
      called on Iran to cooperate in bringing the culprits to justice. The Saudi-drafted text expressed "deep concern"
      at the plot, and encouraged member states to prevent the planning, financing, sponsorship, or organization of
      terrorist acts. Iran introduced four amendments, three of which would have removed all mention of that country
      from the text. All were re'ected.

             While the United States has made progress in many areas toward the goal of a world without nuclear
   weapons, it will require strengthening the global nonproliferation regime and addressing urgent nonproliferation
   challenges, including enhanced IAEA safeguards, cooperation to defeat proliferation networks, and improved
   security for vulnerable nuclear material. Progress on disarmament and nonproliferation is not an either-or
   proposition, but rather represents two aspects of the same goal. Only North Korea opposed this resolution.

            The General Assembly established the Special Committee by Resolution 2443 (XXIII) in 1968. The
   United States believes that this committee embodies institutional discrimination against Israel, that it should be
   abolished, and actively lobbies other countries to withdraw their support for the annual resolution that renews
   the Committee's mandate.

             In joining the Human Rights Council, the United States expressed its willingness to support what the
    Council does well, but also pledged to challenge those aspects of the Council's operation that undermine its
    effectiveness and mandate. The Report is a reflection of the Human Rights Council's strengths and weaknesses.
    The United States abstained.

              The human rights situation remains grave in North Korea. The government controls almost all aspects
    of citizens' lives and refuses to allow international evaluation of human rights conditions.
              The United States strongly supported this resolution as demonstrating the international community's
    concern over the human rights situation in the D.P.R.K., the desire to hold the government accountable for its
    human rights violations, and to improve the situation of human rights there.

                  The international community remains deeply concerned over the deteriorating human rights situation
        in Iran, and the government's failure to uphold its obligations under its own constitution and international
        human rights law. The world continues to bear witness to those in Iran who are trying to exercise their
        universal rights. This resolution signals that their voices are being heard.

       I M PORTANT CONSENSUS ACTI ONS
                The General Assembly approved the following resolutions by consensus. They have been chosen as
       representative of major U.S. policy goals. Though the first resolution was passed before UNGA 66, it is
       included because of its importance.

       1.       Suspension of the rights of membership of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya in the Human Rights Council
       A/RES'65/265                         March 1
                This resolution was the first ever where a standing member of the Human Rights Council was
       suspended for gross violations of human rights. The General Assembly suspended Libya's vote and
       participation in the Council by consensus following the Qadaffi regime's attacks against its own population that
       began in February. Following the seating of the new Libyan government, UNGA voted in November to restore
       Libya to the Council, 123(US)-4-6.

       2.       Report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
                A/Res/66/7                            November   2
                 The resolution declared the IAEA's role indispensable for encouragement and help in development of
       peaceful uses for atomic energy, for technology transfer to developing nations, and for nuclear safety,
       verification, and security.

       3.                 Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism
                A/Res/66/105                          Decerrter 9
                 The resolution strongly condemned all forms of terrorism — including "the atrocious and deliberate
       attacks that have occurred against UN offices in various parts of the world." It called for implementing both the
       UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and subsequent resolutions concerning the Strategy. It also urged
       efficient implementation of appropriate legal instruments and intensifying exchanges of terrorism-related
       information.

    Declaration and its Platform for Action. It called upon the UN Entity for Gender Equality and the
    Empowerment of Women (UN-Women) to continue to support gender mainstreaming across the UN system. It
    urged governments to increase funding to UN-Women by providing core, multi-year, predictable, stable, and
    sustainable voluntary contributions.

             The resolution called for implementing fully the absolute and irreducible prohibition of torture and
    other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. It condemned any action or attempt to legalize,
    authorize, or acquiesce in such treatment or punishment under any circumstances, including on national security
    grounds or through judicial decisions.

    advocating religious hatred.

      Janeiro, Brazil. It encouraged governments to involve and coordinate inputs from all appropriate national
      agencies. It expressed deep concern that funds were lacking for full participation either of representatives from

               The General Assembly approved a 2012-2013 program budget of $5.152 billion. This reflected a 4.9-
      percent decrease from the final 2010-2011 budget, and included reductions in cross-cutting areas such as
      conference services, publications, and other non-staff operational costs. It also reflected U.S. efforts in
      reforming the recosting process, whereby adjustments can be made to account for variances in factors including
      exchange rates and inflation, by deferring these costs until later in the biennium.

   VI RESOLUTIONS RELATED TO ISRAEL
   OPPOSED BY THE UNITED STATES
             Public Law 101-246, as amended by Public Law 108-447, calls for a separate listing of all Plenary
   votes cast by UN member states in the General Assembly on resolutions specifically related to Israel that are
   opposed by the United States. For the 66th UN General Assembly in 2011, 17 resolutions met the criteria.
   Three of these resolutions (66/14, 66/15, and 66/76) have already been included among the important votes in
   Section IV, and so are simply listed here, while noting those who voted with the United States.
             This section contains two parts: (1) a listing and description of the Israel-related votes at the 66th
   UNGA in which the United States voted No, and (2) voting coincidence percentages with the United States on
   all 17 resolutions, alphabetically by country.
             The following 17 resolutions are identified by a short title, document number, date of vote, and results
    Yes-No-Abstain with the U.S. vote noted. All resolutions are or will be available here:
   htt•://www.un.or documents/re s a.htm

            For the United States, these annual General Assembly resolutions condemning Israel are repetitive,
   disproportionate, and one-sided. Israel is repeatedly singled out for criticism, while the resolutions do not fully
   acknowledge that all parties to the conflict bear direct responsibility for ending it. The following hyperlinks
   address the U.S. position on the situation in the Middle East and/or directly address the votes discussed:
   •         Remarks by President Barack Obama on the Middle East and North Africa
   •         Remarks by President Barack Obama to the General Assembly]
   •         The Question of Palestine and the United Nations
   •         Performance-Based Roadmap to a Permanent Two-State Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict'
   •         Remarks by Ambassador Rosemary A. DiCarlo I
   •         UN news release

   The resolutions are listed by the order in which they were approved.

    3.        Special information program on the question of Palestine of the Department of Public Information of
    the Secretariat
              A/Res/66/16                         November 30                           168-8(U9-3
              The General Assembly established the Special Information Program by Resolution 32/40 B (1977).
    The United States believes that the continuation of this Program embodies institutional discrimination against
    Israel, and is inconsistent with UN support for the efforts of the Quartet to achieve a just and durable solution.
    (The Quartet is a group comprised of the United States, the United Nations, the European Union, and Russia.)

      4.        Peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine
                A/Rw/66/17                             November 30                         167-7(UP-4
                Since 1967, the General Assembly has continually adopted resolutions about resolving the Israeli-
      Palestinian conflict. While the United States agrees with the necessity of achieving a peaceful settlement to the
      conflict and that both parties need to fulfill their obligations implementing the Road Map, the United States
      believes that the resolution is one-sided in its criticism of Israel. The resolution also states how issues should be
      resolved, while the United States believes these issues should be resolved between the parties through
      negotiations.
                Voting with the United States: Canada; Israel; Marshall Islands; Micronesia; Nauru; and Palau.

      5.        Jerusalem
                A/RE9'66/18                           November 30                          164-7(U4-5
                The General Assembly has adopted a resolution concerning Jerusalem every year since 1967. The
      United States believes that the final status of Jerusalem should be resolved by the parties to the conflict as part
      of a final, permanent status resolution that also includes the status of borders, refugees, and settlements.
                Voting with the United States: Canada; Israel; Marshall Islands; Micronesia; Nauru; and Palau.

      6.       The Syrian Golan
               A/Res/66/19                           November 30                          119-7(US)-53
               The General Assembly has adopted a resolution concerning the Syrian Golan every year since 1967.
      The United States believes this resolution prejudges the outcome of final-status negotiations, and that Israel and
      Syria should resolve the issue of the Syrian Golan through negotiations. Additionally, the United States
      believes Syria should halt its support for terrorist organizations, including Hizballah.
               Voting with the United States: Canada; Israel; Marshall Islands; Micronesia; Nauru; and Palau.

      7.         The risk of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East
                 A/Res/66/61                           Decerrber 2                         167-6(US)-5
                 A resolution on this issue was first adopted by the General Assembly in 1979. This resolution confines
      itself to expressions of concern about the activities of Israel, without reference to other questions regarding the
      problem of nuclear proliferation in the region.
                 Voting with the United States: Canada; Israel; Marshall Islands; Micronesia; and Palau.

      8.       Persons displaced as a result of the June 1967 and subsequent hostilities
               A/Fies/66/73                         Dexutter 9                           163-7(US)-3
               Following the June 1967 hostilities, the General Assembly has consistently adopted a resolution
      concerning displaced persons. The United States believes that the parties to the conflict should resolve the issue
      of displaced persons through final-status negotiations among theinselves.

                The General Assembly established UNRWA in 1949 by Resolution 302 (IV). The United States
      believes that singling out Israel, without taking into account the context of Israel's actions, is not useful in
      settling the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The United States also believes that extraneous issues in a resolution
      that renews UNRWA's mandate are not appropriate.

              The General Assembly established the UN Conciliation Commission for Palestine in 1948. Among
    other tasks, the Commission is mandated to facilitate the repatriation, resettlement, and economic and social
    rehabilitation of the Palestinian refugees and their compensation. The United States believes that the parties to
    the conflict should resolve the issue of properties and their revenues through final-status negotiations.

    12.      Applicability of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War,
    of August 12, 1949, to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and the other occupied
    Arab territories
             A/Res/66/77                              December 9                           164-70.1.9-2
             The General Assembly first adopted this resolution in 1973,. The United States believes that this
    resolution singles out Israel, isolates it for criticism, and implicitly prejudges the outcome of final-status
    negotiations.

    13.       Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and the occupied

    A/Res/66/78                             December 9                            162-7(US)-4
              Since 1967, the General Assembly has continually adopted resolutions about resolving the Israeli-
    Palestinian conflict. The United States considers that this resolution presents an unbalanced assessment of
    Israeli settlements in the territories. The United States believes that singling out Israel, without taking into
    account the context of Israel's actions, is not useful in settling the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

              Since 1967, the General Assembly has repeatedly adopted resolutions about resolving the Israeli-
    Palestinian conflict. The United States believes that the provision concerning the preservation of territorial
    integrity should be decided between the parties, not in a UN resolution. Also, the United States believes that
    singling out Israel's actions and ignoring those of the Palestinians is not useful in settling the Israeli-Palestinian
    conflict.

       15.      The right of the Palestinian people to self-determination
                A/Res/66/146                           December 19 -                        182-7(US)-3
                The General Assembly first adopted this resolution in 1994. The United States does not object to the
       Palestinian people's right of self-determination, but believes that renewing this resolution is unhelpful in
       resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It does not facilitate the U.S.-endorsed vision of a two-state solution.
       This vision can only be achieved through direct negotiations between the parties, not by UN resolutions.

       16.     Oil Slick on Lebanese Shores
               A/Res/6eV192                          December 22                         165-8(US)-6
               This resolution was first passed in 2006, after thousands of tons of oil spilled into the Mediterranean
       Sea when Israeli air strikes damaged the El-Jiyah power plant during the Israel-Hizballah conflict that summer.
       The United States regrets the pollution of the Lebanese shores. However, this recurring resolution is
       unbalanced because it fails to acknowledge that the terrorist group Hizballah provoked the conflict. It remains
       inappropriate for the General Assembly to take a position on Israel's responsibility for compensating Lebanon.

      17.      Permanent sovereignty of the Palestinian people in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East

               The General Assembly first adopted this resolution in 1994. While not objecting to the Palestinian
      people's right of self-determination, the United States believes that renewing this resolution is unhelpful in
      resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It does not facilitate the vision of a two-state solution, which the
      United States has endorsed. This vision can only be achieved through direct negotiations between the parties,
      not UN resolutions.

      ANTI-ISRAEL VOTES: COMPARISON WITH UNITED STATES
               The table that follows summarizes UN member state performance at the Fall session of the 66th
      General Assembly in comparison with the 17 votes related to Israel for which the United States voted No. In
      these tables, "Same" is the total number of times the United States and the listed state both voted Yes or No on
      these issues. "Opposite" is the total number of times the United States voted Yes and the listed state No, or the
      United States voted No and the listed state Yes. Abstentions and absences are recorded but omitted from
      coincidence percentage calculations. "Coincidence With U.S." is derived by dividing the number of identical
      votes by the sum of identical plus opposite votes, expressed as a percentage.
               The 2011 coincidence rate with the United States on anti-Israel votes was 4.1 percent, down slightly
      from 4.4 percent in 2010 and 4.2 percent in 2009.
               Of the 17 anti-Israel resolutions where the United States and Israel voted No, only eight other countries
      cast even a single vote with them.
