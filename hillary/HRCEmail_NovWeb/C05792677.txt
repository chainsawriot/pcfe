Huma, I think you know how much I, and our entire family, loves Hillary as a friend. She has long been both a hero and
role model in our world.

But, it took some special kind of courage to step to the plate and take responsibility for what happened in Benghazi.

At a time when there is literally no moral or political courage being demonstrated anywhere, it seems somehow
appropriate that, in the same week, both Malala and Hillary stood tall.

I have never been more proud to call Hillary a friend, and I'd appreciate it if you could share that with her.

Much love,

Grandpa Rick
