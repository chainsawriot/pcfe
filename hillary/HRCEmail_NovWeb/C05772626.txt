Hello - thanks for your message!

For Mon 10/18 the thought is to do Julia Roberts not too late in the day.
and the lunch at 1 pm - the idea is to make space for Julia by moving your 9:45 am Monday departmental
meeting to 9:45 am on Tuesday 10/19.

I checked with POTUS' schedulers about Fri 10/15 - unfortunately he is traveling that day. However, we
do have a meeting locked in for Wed 10/20 at 10:30 am.

Understand you want your own pre-brief on Wed 10/20 before the Kissinger Event

No PC has been called yet for Wed 10/20 - though if they do call one during the normal 5 pm slot, that
will indeed present a conflict with the Kissinger event. I've will ask for guidance about what we can expect
w/Donilon now in charge...both in terms of PCs and whether he intends to continue the small aroun
meetings with you and Gates.


Will check about Adm Mullen's dinner and if it is on Thurs 10/21, whether you can make it back in time.

Re the possibility of Raul Yzaguirre on Tues 10/26 - Sharon Hardy with Ceremonials relayed to Raul that
we wanted to offer any date other than 10/21 that worked well for him. He came back with Mon
10/25...even though the Franklin Room is booked that evening. President WJC's schedule does have him
coming back from Jamaica to DC on 10/26 - but that may be just because they were trying to match up
RONs with you. Let me 1) double check w/WJC's office about where he'll be on 10/26 and 2) determine
whether Tues 10/26 is an option for Raul Yzaguirre and/or the Council of La Raza folks

Will report back...happy to make any adjustments as you see fit...thank you again, Eric

Line block questions:



Why is the Julia Roberts interview during the time I have weekly depoartmental meeting?



Also, I don't see a mtg w POTUS on the 15th--can we get that scheduled?



I want to have my own pre-brief before the Kissinger event.



And, I notice that the HBO event conflicts w a PC mtg at WH. Now w/Donilon in charge can
we get a set time for all the regular mtgs so we don't schedule conflicting events?



When is Adm Mullen having his small Pakistan dinner? If it's the 21st, can I get back in
time from Paris?



If La Raza can pay for a reception for Raul, why is his swearing in ceremony in the
Treaty Room instead of the Franklin? Can't we find a time for them? Also, I won't be able
to go to his reception at a hotel since I have to go to the screening for the Nat Geo
special so that day doesn't work so well. What about on the 26th after I get back from NY
since Bill will be in Haiti and could come back to DC?
