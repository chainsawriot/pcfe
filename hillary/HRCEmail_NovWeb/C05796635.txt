I just left Somaly Mam and her girls.
They wanted to be remembered to "Mother Hillary." Alice Kande!l bought them a new refrigerator and a big screen TV
so they have some new imrovements. What an amazing place!

I also met with the land rights women on whose behalf you intervened and I'm bringing back a scarf they knitted for you
in prison. The whole land rights issue has got to be fairly addressed in Cambodia and it will require effort on many levels
with help from many partners.

Good luck in Cairo --- not an easy mission.
