Asean Near Consensus on Sea Row: Indonesia

Southeast Asian nations are "on the cusp" of agreeing a statement of
unity on the South China Sea dispute, Indonesia's top diplomat said
Thursday after meeting his Cambodian counterpart.

Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa has taken on the role of
mediator after the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean)
failed to reach a common position on the row at a gathering in Phnom
Penh last week.

"Despite suggestions to the contrary, in actual fact Asean remains
united," Natalegawa told reporters in the Cambodian capital, on the
third leg of a regional peacemaking tour after visiting Hanoi and
Manila on Wednesday.

Natalegawa said he was working to identify "basic Asean positions on
the South China Sea", which would dispel the perception that the

10-member group is divided.

"We are now on the cusp of formalizing this consensus," Natalegawa said.

Cambodian Foreign Minister Hor Namhong, whose country holds the
rotating Asean chairmanship, told reporters he hoped to announce the
bloc's joint position on Friday, pending "approval from all Asean
foreign ministers."

China claims sovereignty over nearly all of the resource-rich sea,
which is home to vital shipping lanes, but Asean members the
Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei have overlapping claims in
the area.

Divisions over members' territorial disputes with Beijing prevented
Asean from issuing its customary joint statement at the conclusion of
its meeting last Friday, an unprecedented occurrence in the bloc's
45-year history.

Diplomats said a key sticking point was a refusal by host Cambodia, a
close China ally, to mention specific incidents in the sea, pitting it
directly against Manila, which wanted a reference to a months-long
standoff with China over the Scarborough Shoal.

The rift has held up progress on a proposed "code of conduct" between
Asean and China aimed at preventing flare-ups in the contested waters.

After holding talks with his counterparts in Vietnam and the
Philippines on Wednesday, Natalegawa urged Asean nations to push on
with the pact.
