Cheryl and Rich,




This is a tough one. We have been trying to find something appropriate for      for months.                       B5
                                                                                                                  B6




                                                                                              It would be great
if Melanne had an advisory committee for people like this.




Separately I will forward   s most recent email restating her qualifications.                                      B6



Margaret
