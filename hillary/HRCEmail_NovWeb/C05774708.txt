IMF Executive Board Completes First Review Under the Extended Credit Facility
Arrangement for the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, Approves US$18.2 Million
Disbursement
Press Release No. 12/245
June 29, 2012
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the first review of the Islamic
Republic of Afghanistan's economic performance under the program supported by a three-year, SDR 85 million
(about US$129 million) Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement (see Press Release No. 11/412).


Completion of the review makes SDR 12 million (about US$18.2 million) available to the Islamic Republic of
Afghanistan. This would bring total disbursements under the arrangement to SDR 24 million (about US$36.4
million).


Executive Directors noted the progress achieved by the authorities on their reform objectives under the
program during difficult times. In completing the review, the IMF's Board also approved the authorities' request
for a waiver of nonobservance of a performance criterion on fiscal revenues of the central government, and the
authorities' request for modification of performance criteria, as well as rephasing of disbursements.


Following the Executive Board's discussion, Ms. Nemat Shafik, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair,
stated:

"In a very difficult environment, Afghanistan has begun a transition toward greater macroeconomic stability
and economic self-reliance. The IMF-supported economic program has been designed to provide the policy
frameworks for managing this transition and catalyzing support from the international donor community.


"Under their program, the Afghan authorities are pursuing important structural reforms. In particular, they
have drafted a law for the introduction of a value-added tax in 2014, prepared a strategy to fight economic
crimes, and strengthened the central bank's capitalization framework. The authorities have also reported on
asset recovery from Kabul Bank where cash recoveries have increased following a presidential decree.
However, no shareholder has paid in full, and their cases have been referred to a special tribunal and the
Financial Dispute Resolution Committee.


"Going forward, the program will continue to focus on safeguarding the financial sector, strengthening
economic governance, and moving toward fiscal sustainability. While progress has been made on all these
fronts, strong government ownership of the program remains crucial to resist opposition from vested interests.


"The authorities' development strategy rests on greater revenue mobilization and sustained strong donor
support to meet large spending needs for security and development in the years ahead. They look to donors to
firm up their aid pledges at the forthcoming Tokyo Conference. The authorities will need to strengthen budget
implementation capacity, address critical governance issues, and improve accountability within various
government agencies."
