Why Everyone Is Avoiding Gazprom
Moscow Times,
22 August 2012
Ey-Anders Aslund

Gazprom never fails to surprise with its shortcomings. For the
last two decades, Gazprom's gas production has been stagnant,
but this year its output is collapsing. In May, it plummeted
by 15 percent in annual terms, while the leading independent
company, Novatek, increased its gas output by 19 percent.
Even though Gazprom enjoys all the official state privileges, it
still cannot produce. Natural gas is going through a global
renaissance, but Gazprom has no part in that story. It ignores
liquefied natural gas and shale gas, preferring its old paradigm
of pumping gas from onshore giant fields through pipelines to a
stagnant European gas market.

Nor can it sell. During the first four months this year,
Gazprom's exports to Europe plunged 12 percent. Its sales
to Ukraine collapsed by 40 percent in the first half of 2012.
Gazprom continues to insist on its old long-term contracts with
gas prices linked to the oil price, whereas the spot-market gas
price long ago delinked from the oil price. In Europe, Gazprom
is gradually being disciplined by market forces, but it charges
Ukraine and Moldova 40 to 50 percent higher prices than its
European customers.

Nor can it cooperate. For years, Gazprom has been preparing
to tap the Barents Sea's giant Shtokman field, which was
discovered in 1988. In 2007, Gazprom selected Norway's Statoil
and France's Total for cooperation in this field, while keeping
51 percent for itself. After years of negotiations, however,
Gazprom has not come up with an investment agreement for the
first stage of this project. Last month, Statoil withdrew
from the Shtokman project, forfeiting the $336 million it had
already invested and its 24 percent of the project. In effect,
Shtokman has been abandoned for years to come, and Gazprom's
poor reputation has gotten even worse.

In early 2009, Gazprom suffered from an oversupply of contracted
gas from Central Asia since European demand had collapsed during
the global financial crisis. With its characteristic crudeness,
Gazprom closed its pipeline from Central Asia abruptly without
warning in April 2009, and the pipeline exploded
on Turkmenistan's territory. Turkmenistan hastily built
a pipeline to China â€”through Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. And as
a result, China has become Turkmenistan's main foreign customer,
followed by Iran. The Turkmen do whatever it takes to avoid
Gazprom.

The German energy company E.On used to be Gazprom's most loyal
international supporter, but in December 2010 even E.On gave up
on Gazprom and sold its stake of 3.5 percent. That was a wise
decision. Gazprom's low stock price has fallen by another
quarter since E.On sold. Officially, Gazprom was the most
profitable company in the world in 2011, claiming a net profit
of $46 billion, substantially more than the second most
profitable company in the world, ExxonMobil, which made a net
profit of only $41.1 billion. Yet the market value
of ExxonMobil is $408 billion, while Gazprom is worth one
quarter as much, at $112 billion.

The explanation is that ExxonMobil, unlike Gazprom, has decent
corporate governance. Shareholders value giant ExxonMobil at a
price-earnings ratio of 9.3, while they sensibly value Gazprom
at a ratio of only 2.9. Independent Russian gas producer
Novatek, by contrast, has a P/E of 14.5, and its production is
expected to increase by 7 to 11 percent this year. Transneft,
the notoriously leaking oil pipeline agency, has a P/E even
lower than Gazprom's, at 1.8. Although 49 percent of Gazprom is
officially held by private shareholders and 51 percent by the
Russian government, Gazprom managers and top Kremlin officials

decide everything. People and institutions that own shares
in Gazprom have no sense of ownership. Instead, they focus
exclusively on the dividend yield, which is quite high, 5.9
percent, because shareholders know that is all they will get.

The real objective of Gazprom's management could be to siphon
off the company's money, as opposition leaders Boris Nemtsov
and Vladimir Milov have analyzed so well in their study "Putin
and Gazprom." The main means of extracting funds from the
company is capital expenditures, which Gazprom management boost
whenever it can. Originally, Gazprom planned for capital
expenditures of $27 billion last year, but as oil prices
and thus gas prices rose, management threw an additional $25
billion into capital expenditures, for a total of $52 billion.
Read any broker report and you'll see that analysts consider 70
percent of the capital expenditures "value detraction," their
euphemism for corruption.

Gazprom seems interested in little but building export pipelines
to Europe, although its exports to European countries have been
declining for the past few years. Ukraine has an eminent transit
capacity of no less than 120 billion cubic meters a year, which
could easily be expanded to 160 bcm for $3.5 billion. But
Gazprom appears to be determined to divert all gas to Europe
to newly built gas pipelines. The two first Nord Stream pipes
have already been built. They have a capacity of 55 billion
cubic meters and a cost of at least $15 billion. Now Gazprom
wants to double the Nord Stream capacity for a similar amount,
clearly to avoid any transit through Ukraine.

Even so, Gazprom also plans to initiate an even more wasteful
pipeline project, South Stream, with a capacity of 63 billion
cubic meters, at a cost of at least $30 billion. Gazprom CEO
Alexei Miller said the construction of South Stream will start
in December. Meticulously, Gazprom is preparing itself for the
dustbin of history. It performs a valuable role as a litmus test
of the government's real policy aims. As long as the current
Gazprom management stays in place, it is clear that
the government has no interest in limiting corruption.
