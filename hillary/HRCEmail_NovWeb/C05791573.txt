You were the talk of the Global Diaspora Forum yesterday. Your remarks were wonderful. Thnx for taking the time. Its
hard to believe that the State Department never focused on this before. We can do so much more. The Syrian groups in
particular want to meet and get organized and do more.

I noticed that you were mtg w Graham and the faith based groups. It would be great if you mentioned the cookstove
alliance. In the end we need people on the ground to get people to use them and we have found the religious groups to
be a key. We have had great mtgs w the Vatican and their structure of nuns and priests and we have begun discussions
with other groups.

Thnx again for yesterday.

Kris
