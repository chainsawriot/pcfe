  Subject: Garry's Views on Laurent discussion + some general analysis

  Jon-can you fax to BC asap. More forthcoming. Thx lg

  Mr. President,

  Garry didn't dispute the personal fight and conversation details given
  by Laurent to me but 5 major points were false: 1. GC never asked for
  the resolution to be drafted defying parliament request for the
  ministers to present their documents. Laurent tried to blame GC on
  wavering. GC said he would sign if his reservations were note. They
  refused to note his reservations so he refused to sign. Days later
  Parliament changed it from an invitation to a summons, the latter
  requiring them to appear and submit. That's when GC told his ministers
  to comply with the law and presented his own documents. 2. That MM
  told GC to take down the militia (some former military but training
  new haitians) at the fort the occupy. GC said he asked the justice
  minister 3x for an operational plan to take back the fort and the
  justice minister never presented one. He ordered an operation. MM
  squashed it because he's backing them financially and with arms. 3.
  That GC's team was underming MM and were made up of mostly former
  duvalarists. GC has 1 former duvalarist on his team. 4. That GC
  didn't implement projects. GC says everytime he tried, MM squashed it
  with his minister.

   GC believes that his resignation offers the IC an opportunity to join
   in the chorus (media, business, civil society, parliament) of pressure
   on MM. He can no longer use GC as his obstacle. He has to act and show
   he's for democracy or there needs to be consequences. Waiting for this
   truck wo brakes to hit the bottom of the hill will be too late. You
   can be helpful in convincing USG and the IC.

   GC believes and I agree that you shoud continue with your trip on 3-7
   and 3-8 with the investors but publicly and privately speak to the MM
   and the parliament and apply pressure in the way you do so well that
   wo immediate resolution of the • major issues: Ammendments, elections,
   militias investment isn't possible. GC and other trusted sources here
   advise you may be the only one that can mitigate the politics and
   convince MM. Its a risk so we need think carefully b4 acting. Also the
   IC needs to move quickly in pressure. Their statements were all well
   worded with subtle threats but they need to act. The US has to push
   here and I believe some at state, definitely Merten, are advising a

  wait and see attitude. The situation cannot afford Washington                   to sit
  on sidelines. They elected him and they need pressure him. He                   can't go
  unchecked. Same thing with UN. Mariano Fernandez needs to act                   more
  like "mulet" than the quiet peaceful guy he is. I'm meeting w                   him
  tomorrow and will push this issue. Thx lg

  Subject: Update: Meetings today

  Please get to BC asap. Thx lg

  Today I met with Henry from Bellerive's team again and Gabriel.

  Bellerive is desparate to meet with you and its obvious why - he's in
  the hot seat, needs to know where you and USG stand and wants to plead •
  his case. I definitely don't think you should meet with him. We've
  been giving him the cold shoulder treatment for past few months and
  its worked. Henry said and GC agrees that Bellerive will use you to
  tell all - who got what, when where and how - now his motive is self
  serving but the info GC would be helpful so GC recommends that I see
  him on your behalf. Need your guidance on this and if yes would be on
  my next trip here - a few days b4 your scheduled to arrive on 7th.
  More details on what Henry said when I'm back and we can talk.

  Gabriel - said Prevals take is that GC should have stood and fought
  because he could have outmanuevered MM if he had stayed and kept the
  strength. What Preval says makes some sense but GC said he considered
  it and ultimately decided it was too risky. Now Preval has his own
  motives here. He wanted GC who he was supportive of and who GC sought
  advice from several times as PM because GC served as a check to MM.
  Preval, as the other political parties don't want him w a blank check,
  yes man PM and a militia. I can explain more upon my return but Preval
  take on this is by far the most interesting and politically savvy, not
  surprising since that's his strength. Preval also wants to meet with
  you. This one is less risky and we think you should consider doing it.

  The press continues to be favorable for GC. The "average haitian" I
  speak. to (my driver, security, nanny, hotel staff) are losing faith
  in MM and so he was hurt by events of last week. Question is whether
  he realizes it. Jackie is writing a piece on your statement and GC
  people have it, have translated it and are circulating it to haitian
  media outlets and GC said it came at good time because he's having a
  press conference tomorrow and will play into those cycles without
  getting mucked with the IC comments made yesterday. GC is very pleased
  and appreciates what you said.


  Thx Lg

  Subject: Update: Militia Intel

  Pls fax. This is last for today. He now has the latest from today. I'm
  still with Garry and his family if he wants to call and wish him Happy
  Bday. Would cheer him up.

  Mr. President,

  I now have seen the actual intel from MINUSTAH and the evidence of the
  armed militia training throughout the country including evidence that
  the palace is funding and supporting it. I'm meeting with Mariano
  Fernandez tomorrow but GC shared with me this intel last night and its
  obvious from the documents and the pictures what is going on here. Now
  MM people I spoke to try to say its a few people that have no power
  and they aren't militas, they are security. GC says MM is lying to the
  Laurents and the Patricks because he knows they would agree this is
  crazy. The evidence is clear as day and they have already begun
  parading in the streets with guns and chanting in carrefour (less than
  1 hour from PaP) and other areas of the country. MINUSTAH is
  concerned. I saw Mariano briefluy the other day and he expressed it.
  The Brazilians are concerend since they have the command but have
  tried to reach MM on it and he's ignored their recent calls. The US
  has to get involved here. They cannot wait. The impression that Merten
  gave GC yesterday was again "they aren't dangerous right now", "they
  don't have major arsenal" "they are disorganized". No one in the IC
  can afford to sideline this and Mariano needs to set the right tone,
  one similar to Mulet and act on his word this week. I will discuss
  with him tomorrow. There are planned demonstrations tomorrow from
  Lavallas and so they are expecting the streets to be "hot" starting
  early. This is only the beginning. I'm meeting with IC, Fernandez and
  Fisher tomorrow and then leaving tomorrow late afternoon for NY,
  however GC has asked me to return next week in advance of your trip
  and so I will do that. Thx lg

  Sorry one more:

  Mr. President,

  Garry has emailed me a the preliminary report that the commission he
  established did on the contracts which details the amount of
  corruption and the arrogance in they way they did it. We will get it
  translated and sent to you but GC walked me through it and it is
  unbelievable what they did and how stupid or arrogant, they were in
  doing it because when you see it, any idiot can see its fraudelent.
  They thought they would be in power indefinitely and that it would be
  protected. It is the contracts that MM is saying he will come after GC
  with everything he's got to prevent the real details (presumably
  including his take) from coming out - which is why the other email I
  sent you is so important. Signing off for the night in bothering you
  Lg. .

  Subject: Garry's security + reputation risk

  Pis get to BC asap

  MM wants GC to leave the country. The constitution requires him to
  stay until a new PM is ratified which will take months. The parliament
  leadership has said that publicly-they won't give MM a blank check.
  And the people MM wants to send are all yes people and parliament
  knows that. The only consensus pick would be Laurent. GC will not
  leave because 1. He is constitutionally required to stay. 2. He
  doesn't want to look as though he's fleeing and allow MM people to
  dish that he did something wrong 3. He doesn't want to give MM the
  ability to appoint an interim caretaker PM who will be a yes man and
  thus will do things that are illegal including pre-dating bad
  contracts that GC refuses to do. If you pre-date the contracts to b4
  GC resignation then the money can be spent by a caretaker GoH. If its
  not pre-dated it can't sign new deals.
  Though I understand and agree with GC points for staying, his life has
  and continues to be threatened by people associated with MM and MM has
  said himself he will do all it takes to take GC down (now whether that
  means harm or kill him or harm his reputation no one knows, but we
  cannot afford that risk). The US - Cheryl - promised him American
  backed security immediateluy but when he met with Merten yesterday
  Merten was not only in the mind frame of "well MM is not such a bad
  guy and he's better than previous presidents" but he didn't discuss or
  offer any security. Every day, GC life and reputation are at risk. The
  US and or the IC must go to MM and tell him that nothing is to happen
  to GC, not even a tree accidentally falling on him, or MM will face
  consequences. That needs to be delivered immediately. GC believes and
  trusts Cheryl's word but doesn't trust Merten or see the action or
  desire by Merten to carry it out. This is critical and you can help
  here by talking to HRC and or Cheryl. This needs to happen
  immediately. GC and his family are very fearful.
