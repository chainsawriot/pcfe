       Export-Import Bank Announces Another Record-Setting Year
       Bank's FY'12 Financing Exceeds $35.8 Billion, Supports 255,000 American Jobs

      Washington, DC – In preliminary Fiscal Year 2012 (FY'12) results released today, the
      Export-Import Bank of the United States (Ex-Im Bank) reported a fourth-straight record-
      breaking year, approving more than $35.8 billion in authorizations, which supported
      more than 255,000 American jobs in communities across the country. The Bank worked
      with more than 3,400 U.S. companies, 85 percent of which were small businesses. All
      told, Ex-Im financing has helped support hundreds of thousands of jobs over the last four
      years. FY'12 ended on September 30th.

      "Our fourth-straight record breaking year is a testament to the hard work and ingenuity of
      American exporters and their workers," said Ex-Im Bank Chairman Fred P. Hochberg.
      "This year, Ex-Im helped support 255,000 quality jobs in communities across the
      country, all at no cost to the taxpayer. President Obama set an ambitious goal of doubling
      exports and thanks to the entrepreneurial spirit of exporters large and small and the
      dedication of Bank staff—we are on our way to meeting that goal. As we continue our
      economic recovery, Ex-Im remains open for business. We want to make sure that the
      'Made in the USA' label is stronger than ever and that our nation's small businesses are
      able to compete on a level playing field."

       Small business financing rose more than ninety percent from $3.2 billion in FY 2008 to
       $6.1 billion in FY'12. As part of its efforts to increase this portfolio, Ex-Im Bank's
       Global Access for Small Business initiative has held more than 40 forums across the
       country since launching the program in January 2011.
