No votes or UC agreements today. Expect everyone to move tomorrow after debt limit vote, with the exception of
                                  Raj, Tom and Phil are clear so far. Senate Iran sanctions bill is also likely to move
tomorrow. Steinberg even called Howard Kohr today to urge their support for a Presidential waiver for closely
cooperating countries. Lierberman is looking at our language now, but I am not hopeful.
