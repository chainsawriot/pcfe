... for not being there tomorrow at Brookings for your star turn, but I've got a long-standing commitment to be
in Budapest for a meeting with George Soros on the future of his foundationâ€”plus a dinner
                                          Many thanks for doing the event. I'm sure my colleagues and our
guests will be appreciative and perhaps even polite. I look forward to catching up at some point. Cheers, Strobe
