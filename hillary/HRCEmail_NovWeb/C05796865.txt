          Hillary

          I'm so pleased and delighted that your health is steadily getting better. You need and deserve
          the best of times with your family and with whatever you decide to do.

          It's impossible to find words to tell you how much your public admiration meant to me and
          perhaps, more importantly, with the time you took out of your horrific schedule for a personal
          phone call.

          Many blessings my friend
          Inez
