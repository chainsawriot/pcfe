Dear Bob,

What can I say? Other then thank you for your tribute in TIME and express worry about what's happened to your
judgment in the last year.

Really, it was way too kind of you and I am very grateful for your friendship and our service together?

I hope we can find time for a visit somewhere--even in DC--(yours (and my) favorite city) before year's end or after I join
you in what seems like a very attractive post Sit Room life.

Congratulations on becoming Chancellor at William and Mary and best wishes to you and Becky--H
