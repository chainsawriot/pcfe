Apologies -- I've spent the last 90 minutes first with Bill Burns and then with Jack (talking about how to manage issues
when he goes!).

Trying to reach you now on the MEPP stuff. On the FA article, I gave extensive comments as did Jack and Raj. I haven't
seen anything further beyond the last draft we both saw. When the draft comes tonight we can take stock and develop
an action plan. I believe we can buy a fair amount of time since this won't even be posted to the web until Oct 15.

I don't want to keep you hanging all evening. I will spare you the excuses; we think we can have you something by 9:00.
In some ways it's getting rougher before it's getting smoother, as we get the top right and add examples. But it would be
very good to have you engage again to make sure we are going in the right direction. This draft also benefits from
extensive comments from Jack, Raj, and Jake. AM
