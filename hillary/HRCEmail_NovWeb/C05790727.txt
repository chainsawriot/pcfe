HILLARY SNUBS JONAS ON SVALBARD

What's next - Article V?

Special to Aftenposten by Tor Andre Flo

OSLO - Fresh off of securing American support for Norway's claim in a dispute Russia under
the Svalbard Treaty, Foreign Minister Jonas Stoere had a rude shock when Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton declined to reaffirm that support in a press conference today.

The Svalbard treaty of 1945 guarantees Norway's territorial integrity and delimits boundaries
with Russia. It left open certain territorial claims that have now become relevant because
of technological advances in mining and drilling. Russia and especially returning President
Vladimir V. Putin have been aggressively pushing Russia's claims.

In the face of increasing pressure, Stoere sought a meeting with Assistant Secretary of State
Philip Gordon on the margins of the NATO Summit in Chicago. At that meeting, Gordon
delivered a diplomatic note offering a clear position for the first time that the United
States supports Norway's claim. Stoere returned to Oslo triumphant.

Fast forward to Friday June 1 in Oslo. Stoere teed up a reporter to ask Clinton to state the
postion publically at a press conference following a global health summit . Clinton declined
to do so, leaving Stoere befuddled. Indeed, her answer seemed to imply that this was
Norway's problem and not the United States'. Clinton's non-response has raised questions
about Stoere really got the commitment he claimed.

Ole Gunnar Skoljskaer, a policy analyst at the Centre of Peace and Security Studies in
Bergen, said Clinton's comments would raise a lot of eyebrows.

"Not supporting Norway on this is like not supporting Article V," he said. "We need to
understand the U.S. position."

Reached for comment as Clinton departed for Tromso, U.S. Embassy spokesman Patrick McDermott
said, "The Secretary misspoke. Clearly the U.S. supports Norway's position under the
Svalbard Treaty."

Unaware of the events in Oslo, Putin's traveling spokesman Dmitri Peskov also spoke to the
issue from the plane to Berlin. "This is, as they say, cut and dried. No one supports
Norway's claim. No one."

So where does this leave the issue? Foreign policy observers are keen to find out.
