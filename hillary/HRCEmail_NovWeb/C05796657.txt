All: Just greeted and dropped off Thein Sein and crew at hotel. Safe, sound and in good spirits. Rode in from airport with
ministers, sat next to key advisor U Soe Thein. He noted hotel mtg btw ASSK and TS tonite,




                                                                                                                               B5




ST also clarified that there are now three super ministries in the president's office that should facilitate engagement and
grease skids a bit more on initiatives. He oversees the key econ ministries (rail, finance, energy, etc); Aung Min is the
foreign pol/natl security guy (Home Afrs, For Afrs, Immigration, etc); and Tin Nyein Thann (sic?), the former planning
minister, is taking on econ planning and aid coordination. Latter is our guy for Jan it seems (he's not on this delegation),
tho ST can assist as well.

On other fronts, ST lamented that not all pol prisoners were released couple weeks back. Pres blinked in reaction to
conservatives in Home Affairs and military. He understood that small moves at this point are unhelpful politically for
Burma and has said as much to TS.                                                                                              B51
