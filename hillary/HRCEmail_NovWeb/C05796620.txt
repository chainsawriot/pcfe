Subject: Jordan's Islamists say they will boycott elections (AP)

AMMAN (AP) - A spokesman for Jordan's powerful Muslim Brotherhood says his group will boycott the
upcoming parliamentary elections in protest over recent changes in the kingdom's election legislation.
   A boycott would be a blow to King Abdullah, who has made reforms the centerpiece of his campaign to stave
off Arab Spring-like protests in Jordan.
   Brotherhood spokesman Jamil Abu-Bakr said Friday that the movement _ Jordan's largest opposition group _
may reverse its decision if the government "makes serious and real efforts toward reforms."
   The elections are expected at the end of the year. The main dispute is over a new election law, which allows
each voter two separate ballots _ one for representatives from local districts in this traditionally tribal society,
the other for one of 27 candidates on a national list.
