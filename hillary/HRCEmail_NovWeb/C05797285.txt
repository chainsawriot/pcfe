Thanks so much for letting me be a part of it.

She was incredible today. Watching her go toe to toe w/ Senator Johnson gave me (and a lot of us, I expect) the feeling
of being a part of something important and right. So, being able to support that in any small way was truly an honor.
Hope you both get a chance to rest at some point!

Thanks again (                                                                                                            B6

PS - since I'll be here until 3AM prepping for Kerry tomorrow, I could probably do a 3AM call, ha!

No 3am call - b/c of you, S answered the 3am call the way every diplomat and development expert could be proud
about.

She has had no better team -- and I've worked with her for many years - you are impeccable.

That said, I don't want to disappoint (or not be true to myself) ...

We do have QFRs this week. :)

So let's stay focused (this week).

 Love love love you all.

 I am eternally grateful.

Guys, great day today. Congratulations to all on the terrific work.

But I want to remind everyone that S is back before SFRC tomorrow morning. So we have to stay on our toes.

We'll be doing a 3am call, and Cheryl will send specific taskings, including:

• Determining the history of introductions

• A framework for a strategy for an introduction

• 9 tranches of all quill inked correspondence between Thomas Jefferson and his home state senators

• One-pagers; they can be blank, but we need to fill a binder of white pieces of paper.

• Said binder can not/not be assembled before 12:01am
