I thought you would be interested in the following description of a nightcap discussion that I will be participating in at
the Munich Security Conference with Carl Bildt and possibly Peter Thiel, moderated by our own (formerly) Ben Scott.
Note the first question re the "pivot to the people," which is how I often describe the 21St century statecraft revolution.

 „Nowhere should we be more attuned to social media than in international relations", a
 British ambassador recently wrote. While some argue that the new focus on social media
 and more direct government-to-people interaction in the foreign policy of some countries is,
 at best, a waste of time, many officials and diplomats do acknowledge the indispensability
 of social media for their work. After all, social media are not, as a common misconception
 has it, merely a new tool for communicating messages in one direction. According to a
 study, the U.S. State Department today communicates with more than 15 million people via
 social media. These means give diplomats the ability to listen to and understand more
 constituencies and to interact with them directly and in a transparent fashion. At a time
 when Youtube videos uploaded on one side of the globe can cause riots on the other,
 diplomats can hardly ignore or underestimate new ways of understanding societies.
 Eventually, this recognition may even fundamentally change the job description of a
 diplomat. However, social media use certainly is not always risk-free or unproblematic, as
 the debates about tweets by the U.S. embassy in Egypt last year and the activities by
 Israel and Hamas during the Gaza crisis have shown, respectively. Moreover, the
 continued acceleration and permanence of communication and information streams could
 make foreign policy, especially the crucial distinction between the urgent and the important,
 even more challenging.
 Guiding Questions                                 Is the "pivot to the people", the assumption
                                                   that "the people of every country stand on
                                                   the same footing as their government" really
                                                   "a revolution for diplomacy" as Anne-Marie
                                                   Slaughter has argued? Is the use of social
                                                   media an inevitability for diplomats in the
                                                   future?
                                                   Will it change the job of embassies
                                                   altogether? In other words, could it even be
                                                   more important for diplomats in the future to
                                                   analyze and engage movements and public
                                                   debates than to keep track of backroom
                                                   whispers and deal with governments
                                                   sources?
                                                   How should countries harness the
                                                   opportunities the digital age affords — and
                                                   the deal with the challenges it presents — in
                                                   their foreign policies?
                                                   How can and should digital networks and
                                                   information and communication
                                                   technologies be used, both as an instrument
                                                   for policy and as a means of public
                                                   diplomacy? What are the risks?
