Attached is a condensed curriculum vitae and letters of recommendation that I have received.

I seek reappointment as an Ambassador, and of course, appreciate any help you can give me.

I am anxiously awaiting news about you, and hope there is no hitch! If so, let me know, and we will see if I can help.

I saw Secretary Clinton last week in Jerusalem. She looked great. I emailed Mr. Clinton (the spouse) and told him she
"did us proud!!")—and she did.

Thanks for any help you can give me in my quest.
