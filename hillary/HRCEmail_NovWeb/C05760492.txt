Apologies for Cross-Posting




Dear Colleagues:




      UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760492 Date: 11/30/2015
      UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760492 Date: 11/30/2015




I am pleased to announce that I have been asked to join the State Department as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State
in the Bureau for Population, Refugees and Migration. I anticipate assuming this position before the end of the year.




You may have received a previous email from me indicating that I had accepted a post as a Senior Fellow at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies. As I was preparing to join CSIS, I received a call from the State Department asking
me to become the DAS in PRM. While the timing was unusual, this can often be the case with political appointments.




I am most grateful for the gracious understanding of the CSIS team to take the opportunity to serve my country on vital
humanitarian issues, as well as to the Center for American Progress for giving me the opportunity lead the Sustainable
Security Program there.




For the time being, I can continue to be contacted at                       until my official State Department contact
information is available.




Sincerely yours,




Reuben Brigety
