I just spoke with Brahimi. He conveyed following:        – Declassify on: 12/06/2027

Program/Logistics
• Russians confirmed, as we have, that they are fine with his proposed program, and game-plan
• The meeting will take place in Conference Room 1 at the Palais des Nations. The U.S. delegation will have a separate
    office set-up, nearby.
• LB suggests a bilateral with U.S., in advance, at 1015 at the Intercontinental (where he will be staying, too)
• He will organize the working lunch. To keep it manageable, he proposes Principals plus 2. Annan will also join.
• This will end on Sunday.
• Casey Addis from USUN-Geneva (Control Officer) is linked up with Moncef Khane from Brahimi's office to coordinate
    the logistics. The Chief of Staff at the UN Office in Geneva (Josh Lincoln), is also in the loop.

Summary of conclusions (he hopes that following will be solidly agreed by the end of the meeting—in his near verbatim
words—but he asked to keep close hold):
•                                                                                                                        1.4(B)
•                                                                                                                        1.4(D)
•                                                                                                                        Bi

Next steps
• While no paper will be on the table at this meeting, he believes it should be at a follow-up meeting soon thereafter
• He could produce such a paper, if all agree—with key elements for the political transition and a UNSCR—on the
   basis of bilateral discussions he would have with each side the week of December 10

•   The next meeting would happen at the same level, either in Washington or Moscow (as participants prefer), during
    the week of December 17. (He is ready to go anywhere, at any time)
•   A move back to the actual UNSC to adopt a resolution would ideally happen before Christmas (though this remains
    to be determined if desirable/feasible)

He is meeting with his team tomorrow morning (at 1000 Paris time) to discuss. Any reactions before then would be
welcome. He is open to any and all suggestions, including if/how to go even further at this meeting in Geneva.

Best,
Salman

Subject: Syria: Geneva Meeting (SBU)

I just received a call from JSR Lakhdar Brahimi (LB). He expressed great appreciation for S's engagement in Dublin.. He
was very impressed with how she had handled the discussion with SL and said he could not have asked for anything
more.
                                                                                                                1.4(B)
As for the meeting on Sunday with D (B) and DFM Bogdanov, LB's current, tentative thinking is as follows:
                                                                                                                1.4(D)
                                                                                                                B1

•                                                                                                                      1.4(B)
S                                                                                                                      1.4(D)


All of above is his very preliminary thinking. He is open to any suggestions/concerns we have. He'll likewise consult the
Russians and make sure they are comfortable with this.

LB suggested that we talk again on Saturday, so he can provide a firmer idea of how he intends to play the meeting.

Best,
Salman
