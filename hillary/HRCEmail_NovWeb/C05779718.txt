Hillary, I will find a few select journalists for the dinner we discussed. The name I couldn't remember was, of course,
Arthur Schlesinger. Also, Christiane interviewed a senior Iranian in geneva this week, who I think said something worth
exploring. He said Iran would accept more than NPT requirements, what he called the Japan model of permanent
human presence at their sites, in exchange for U.S. cooperation per NPT on technology. It seems to me that goes
beyond previous statements and I thought I would pass it on. Enjoyed our talk. All best, Jamie p.s. the text of the
interview should be available to your office. If not, I will find..

You're right, we will!

Sorry for the delay in responding, but I've had big problems w my blackberry, which has been having a nervous
breakdown on my dime!

I'm delighted to hear about your new job and would love to talk w you about it. I will ask my team to reach out to set up
a visit. Looking forward to catching up--all the best. H

Subject: We will always have Paris..

Greetings, the last time we saw each other was Paris, I believe, right after the fall of Qaddafi. Although Libya is still
messy, I think your efforts to keep the world's focus on removing Qaddafi and helping avoid a slaughter there
last year will be long remembered.




      'In any event, in Paris I mentioned the possibility of arranging some off the record events with key journalists and
influential types for you in your last year as Secretary of State. Although Bloomberg is not the right place for it any
more, I am also President of the Atlantic Partnership in NYC and Washington, which could be a perfect venue for such
events, if you are still interested.

- In the meantime, I did want to ask you about coming to see you in Washington in connection with my work for Andrew,
in order to promote some international opportunities for the State of New York, for which I hope you still have a soft
spot. I have also heard from some colleagues that you have set up a foreign affairs board analogous to the Pentagon's
Defense Policy Board

                               In any event, I hope I can get in to see you in Washington, or if it suited you better, on
one of your rare downtimes in New York.

Best regards, your friend,

Jamie
