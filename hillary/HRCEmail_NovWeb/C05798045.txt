                                                Quartet Envoys' Meeting
                                                Amman, January 10, 2013


 The Quartet envoys met in snow-blanketed Amman on January 10.

                                                                                                                          1. (B)

Turning to the PA's fiscal crisis, EU envoy Andreas Reinicke noted that the EU has allocated 300 million euros for the
Palestinians, half in budget support to the PA and the other half in project-related funding and support for UNRWA. The
EU plans to frontload 60 million euros in budget support in three monthly installments, with the first arriving by the end
of January. Reinicke also noted the EU's willingness to host a donor meeting in Brussels on the margins of the next Ad
Hoc Liaison Committee (AHLC) meeting, currently scheduled for March 19 or 21, if there is an expectation that more
donor funding would be made available. UN envoy Robert Serry questioned the usefulness of another AHLC meeting at
this stage, in the absence of a broader approach to MEP. The Envoys agreed to revisit this after speaking to PA PM
Fayyad about his aims moving forward.

The Envoys also briefly discussed Palestinian reconciliation and developments in Gaza.                                       1.4(D)
                                                                                                                             B1




On the Gaza ceasefire,                                                                                                       1.4(B)
                                                                                                                             B1


                                                           OQR representative Firas Raad noted that an OQR delegation
would be traveling to Cairo this week to explore electricity and energy opportunities that could help undergird ceasefire
discussions.

Raad noted that Quartet representative Tony Blair is scheduled to travel to Israel the week after the January 22 Israeli
elections, where he will meet with PM Netanyahu, and plans a follow-up trip in early February. The envoys agreed to
speak by phone in late January or early February, during which Blair may provide a readout of his meetings. Envoys also
agreed to consider a Quartet Principals meeting on the margins of the G-8 foreign ministerial in London, April 10-11.
