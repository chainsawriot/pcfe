Subject: Israeli police enter Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem (U)

(U) Israeli police forces entered the holy site to stop Palestinian rioters from throwing stones at Jewish worshippers,
according to press. A police spokesman said the stone throwers fled into the Al Aqsa Mosque, and after the situation
quieted, riot forces pulled back. Palestinian youths clashed with police throughout the day following the deadly shooting of
a Palestinian man by an Israeli security guard.
