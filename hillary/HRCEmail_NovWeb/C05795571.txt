Subject: Weekend read: Detailed, interesting, and important piece on Syria from Der Spiegel

It's too long for me to put in an email, but here is the link (be sure to click on and print out part 2 as well).
http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/violence-on-the-rise-in-syria-as-assad-seeks-to-maintain-control-a-
845935.html The most important points, in my view, are:

    1) the perception on the ground that Assad will do ANYTHING to stay in power, including using chemical weapons
       on his own people. I agree and don't think the Russians really have any leverage to stop him.
    2) The detail about the FSA brigades and the way young commanders have taken control (a little like the class of
       young captains who led their units in Afghanistan and have returned as leaders) and are trying to get financing
       on their own through social media
    3) The assessment of the balance of power b/w the FSA, including Islamist units, and the true jihadists
    4) The view that power is crumbling along the periphery, which suggests that we can supply arms and assistance to
       FSA commanders in border zones and insist that they allow journalists and monitors in to watch what they do.

Best,
AM
