Subject: Kissinger and Burma

Chatted with Dr. K for about a half hour tonight at the Atlantic Council. He's fascinated by Burma, but admitted he
wished he knew more and regretted that had never encountered any Burmese - other than U Thant back in the day and
ASSK and her delegation tonight. He said he is a big fan of S, and especially her bold Burma policy. I told him about our
"Kissinger-esque" planning for the 2011 S trip under Kurt's leadership - which delighted him and got him telling a few
stories about his own Beijing adventure. Maybe these are old yarns, but I had no idea that he spent the nearly two days
with Chou En-lai without bringing up the Nixon visit - he waited until the latter finally asked "What about the visit?" to
which Dr. K coyly replied "What visit?"

He's looking forward to seeing Thein Sein next week (asked if I would be there; I explained ASSK travels - but said I
thought Derek might be there). He's interested in going to Burma in October (from Singapore) and might contact S with
his interest. I know October is packed with visitors, but I encouraged his general interest - noting that his China
experience would in particular resonate with the reformist GOB. He asked if it could be done in a day, but agreed with
me that he'd really need to do NPT and not just Rangoon. I'm not sure if he will follow up on this - but his mind was so
sharp on all matters that I'm compelled to share this all with you tonight! Regards -

Patrick
