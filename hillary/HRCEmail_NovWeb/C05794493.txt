Max knows how to do this and fearless. Hope it's useful and gets around, especially in the Middle
East.

Keep speaking and clarifying. Your statements have been strong. Once through this phase, you might
clarify history of US policy on Arab Spring, what has been accomplished, US interests at stake, varying
relations with Libya & Egypt, etc.

Romney, of course, is contemptible, but contemptible on a level not seen in past contemptible
political figures. His menace comes from his emptiness. His greed is not limited simply to mere filthy
lucre. The mixture of greedy ambition and hollowness is combustible. He will do and say anything to
get ahead, and while usually self-immolating he is also destructive. Behind his blandness lies
boundless ignorance, ignited by consistently wretched judgment. His recent statements are of a piece
with everything else he has done from naming Ryan to his welfare ads, etc.

Keep speaking...
