Shaun writes me:

This is not wait and see - this is entirely disingenuous by Reg, who is more

than aware that one of the five who voted against this today is a UUP Assembly

member David McNarry. Reg is trying to do everything he can to wreck the

HCAgreement and that includes being more than economical with the truth with

HRC. The point is that the Orange Order did not vote with McNarry and the UUP

failed today to get the vote they wanted!

Order welcomes parades progress

The Orange Order today signalled its backing for parading proposals as part of a

landmark deal to devolve law and order powers to Northern Ireland.

An overwhelming majority at the organisation's quarterly meeting welcomed

progress made through the joint Sinn Fein/Democratic Unionist plan.

The endorsement of the Orange institution is seen as crucial to the ultimate

success of proposed reforms on how contentious marches are managed.

After a meeting of 120 members of the order's Grand Lodge near Dungannon, Co

Tyrone, Grand Master Robert Saulters said 95 per cent backed so far the parading

aspect of the Hillsborough Agreement.

"We welcome the progress that has been made to bring legislation forward and

publish a Bill and will make final comment when we see the Bill," he said.

Mr Saulters added: "We reaffirm our concerns on civil and religious liberties

for all and regret the campaign to deprive people of the right to freedom of

assembly."

The order's central committee, which met on Monday, recommended rank and file

give its tacit support for the proposed framework to resolve contentious

marches.

The proposal was passed without amendment.

The new framework for marches was devised by a six-man Sinn Fein/DUP working

group that was set up as part of the wide-ranging accord hammered out by

Stormont's two main parties at Hillsborough Castle, Co Down, last month.

The DUP's three representatives in the group briefed the order's central

committee on Monday and it is understood the senior Orange representatives gave

their proposals the thumbs up.

While details of the new management structures have not been made public, it is

understood they are heavily influenced by a recent review of parades carried out

by former Liberal Democrat leader Lord Ashdown.

Central to those was the axing of the current Parades Commission adjudication

panel, with more emphasis placed on achieving localised resolutions.

The parades settlement is a key tenet of the Hillsborough Agreement, which has

been credited with staving off the threatened collapse of the power-sharing

government.

The deal sets out a series of inter-connected processes that will see justice

powers devolved from London to Belfast in April and revised parading legislation

placed on the statute by the end of the year.

The Grand Lodge meeting comes ahead of next week's crucial vote in the Assembly

on the proposed timetable for law and order transfer.

Empey just told me the Orange Order did NOT vote for it but took a wait and see



attitude. Can you confirm what happened?

Re: NI latest




1.         Shaun got former President George W. Bush to call Cameron yesterday



through Paula Dobriansky, the former special envoy. The report back: Bush



delivered the message, he told Cameron he considered it important for Cameron to.




get the UUP to complete the peace conference. Cameron said he was in favor.



2.          This morning the Orange Order that organizes Protestant parades voted to




recommend acceptance of the recent Hillsborough Castle agreement on future

parades by an overwhelming margin, 100-5. Rather than standing outside the



parading commission, this vote is a sign of confidence by Unionism in the new



agreement.



3.       All evidence is that the UUP is trying to make Peter Robinson's life



impossible. On Thursday, March 4, Empey finally produced a document laying out



the UUP position. Among its demands was one for reorganization of the executive,




conceived to undermine the process. Robinson and McGuinness, in fact, have



already asked Empey to head a commission to make recommendations on making the



executive work better. Robinson has told Shaun he is prepared to help Empey on



the education issue, but not if he is unwilling to help on the peace process.



Empey is also making a demand about who can be the justice minister that Shaun



characterizes as "insane." The DUP and Sinn Fein have already created a process



not to nominate someone from their respective parties to be justice minister to



avoid putting in the post whose past is incendiary from Sinn Fein. Empey's



demand to return to the old process is intended as merely a wrecking device.

4.       Shaun is having done a poll of NI public opinion that, if it comes out



well, will be released to the press by Monday. Robinson has shared his private



polling with Shaun that shows more than 86 percent of the NI public support the



agreement.



5.       It is unclear what is going on with Cameron. Is he actually pushing for



the agreement or not? If he is, does he have any influence? Either Cameron is



purposefullly not being strong with Empey or he is being spurned, making calls.



If he is not really pressuring Empey, it would be out of a desperate and vain



attempt to grab a parliamentary seat in the case of a hung parliament—a seat



that is out of his grasp—the Sylvia Hermon seat.



6.       Robinson has previously declared he would resign if the UUP didn't



endorse the agreement. But Shaun says that he's getting signs that Robinson may



be moving away from that position. There is a prospect that Empey's failure to



endorse might not produce meltdown. If so, that would toll the end of the UUP.



Having tried to wreck the agreement, they would be left stranded. If Robinson

stood firm then, didn't resign, triggering new elections, he might well achieve



the isolation of the UUP.
