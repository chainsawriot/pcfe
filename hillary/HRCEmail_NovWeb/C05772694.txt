Raj--

  Jim Jones just called to tell me he remembered a food distribution system the Air Force used in Bosnia. They dropped
cardboard boxes w/out tops filled w MREs from the backs of low-flying C-130s. The air pressure caused the meal
packages to inflate so they floated to the ground. They did that every night for months w/out any injuries on the ground,
feeding thousands of people. He's asked the Air Force to plan to do that here, and I urged him to push for the decision
to be made to try this by Tuesday night. He's also told Gates and Mullen about this and expressed surprise that no one
else recalled it being done.

 I told Gen. Jones I was going to tell you about it so we could consider and assist in execution if plan went forward.
Please find out if anybody at AID knows about this and reach out to the military (probably Gen. Keen) to discuss. And let
me know so I can help push.

Thank you so very much. I will be in very early tomorrow.

We need to "win" this coming week -- maintain security, dramatically scale commodity flow to Haiti via multiple routes,
and address "last mile" delivery to Haitians while simultaneously building confidence in the government, the aid system,
and the vision for the future. We'll be very focused this week and continue to learn fast and establish processes here
and Haiti to allow this effort to succeed.

Thank you again for your generous note and powerful example.

Raj
