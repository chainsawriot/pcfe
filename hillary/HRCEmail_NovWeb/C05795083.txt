Fascinating piece. Along the lines of the Virginia Tech study I believe I told you about earlier this year.
Had lunch with LIssa the other day. She is doing great things at P&P. She filled me in on her views about
Amazon/Kindle.She understands the benefits of the DoS program but clearly no need for you to step into the
middle of that controversy. Probably better for it to move forward with little fanfare.
