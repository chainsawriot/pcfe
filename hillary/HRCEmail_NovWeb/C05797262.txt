Thanks much. It has been a great honor to serve under S and to be part of the legacy she (and all of you up on 7) built
here.




In any event, I hope to thank you in person at some point before we all scatter.

Cheryl,

        I'm at State this week on my last working visit as Ambassador, so I had a chance to watch S's testimony
today. Extremely well done â€” powerful, direct, and unabashed. Made me proud.
