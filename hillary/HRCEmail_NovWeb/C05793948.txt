                            Meeting with Melanne Verveer, Cheryl Mills and Jennifer Klein
                                               March 6, 10:00 a.m.

CONTEXT

This meeting will provide an opportunity for you to share your support for the process that we have put in place to
institutionalize the work on women and girls that has been a priority throughout your tenure and to implement a
strategic communications strategy to support this approach to foreign policy.

BACKGROUND

As you know, Maggie Williams provided an internal and external strategic communications strategy to build support for
an approach to foreign policy that includes a focus on women and girls. The document sets out an aggressive plan to
make the case that foreign policy interests are best served by integrating work on women and girls into diplomacy and
development. The plan underscores the importance of institutionalizing this approach in the work of the Department;
creating a narrative to describe how, using this approach, the State Department has changed the way we engage in
foreign policy to generate results; and building and presenting a strong evidence base to support this case.

It then envisions an effort to communicate this vision and strategy to the foreign policy community, the American public
and other audiences; to deploy your and Melanne's time to the best effect, efficiently; to develop validators and
surrogates to support the message; to enlist the support of the business community and other key constituencies; and
to use new media and other innovative communications tools.
