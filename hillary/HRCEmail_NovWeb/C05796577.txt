Subject: (SBU) From Hale: Erekat and Quartet Meetings

Dear Colleagues,

Below is a brief readout of the relevant part of my meetings today with Erekat and separately the Quartet. Erekat
reassured fully on what Abbas will say and do (and ncit say or do) on the 27th and afterward. I have briefed Molho, who
was showing signs of renewed anxiety, including that Abbas may talk about walking away from Oslo.

The Quartet was of little interest to others, except for the astonishing position taken by the EU that because we didn't
support "the urgent need for an Principals' meeting" this week, they were not prepared to agree to a Principals' meeting
before the end of the year, as the UN had been seeking.

Special Envoy Hale and CG Ratney's Meeting with Palestinian Negotiator Saeb Erekat

(SBU) In a meeting with SEMEP David Hale and CG Michael Ratney in advance of Secretary
Clinton's meeting with President Abbas on Wednesday, September 24, Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat reaffirmed that Abbas' UNGA speech on Thursday, September 25 will note the
Palestinians' intention to begin consultations on enhanced status at the UNGA, but will
not address a specific timeframe for a vote., and no draft or elements of a resolution will
be circulated. Erekat noted, moreover, that Abbas has made clear to other governments that
the Palestinians do not want any of them speaking for or pursuing this initiative, or introducing
a resolution, or elements thereof, at this time and that Abbas has no intention of having
Palestinian statehood become an issue at this time. According to Erekat, the aim of the speech
is to address the Palestinian people directly; acknowledge the economic difficulties many
Palestinians face today; raise concern about continued settlement activity and settler violence;
and reemphasize the Palestinians' commitment to a two state solution. Abbas also intends to
make clear that the Palestinians do not seek to delegitimize Israel, but instead extend a hand to

Israel by outlining the "known parameters" for resolving the conflict â€” the creation of a
Palestinian state based on the 1967 lines with East Jerusalem as its capital and a just resolution
to the refugee issue. He said there would be no language about "handing the keys of the
occupation" back to Israel, walking away from the Oslo accords, or of his own possible
departure.

Quartet Meeting

(SBU) Hale also attended a Quartet envoys meeting, chaired by the UN and with Tony Blair in
attendance. Envoys reviewed the dire situation on the ground and steps needed to preserve the
PA as well as future options for resumed negotiations. There was disagreement on whether to
agree to hold a Quartet Principals meeting by the end of the year, with the EU envoy arguing
that because the Quartet was unable to meet at that level during UNGA, the EU was not
persuaded of the need for a meeting later in the year.
