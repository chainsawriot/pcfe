Sid--I just got this as I am heading for the Belfast airport. Not sure I could have arranged it anyway. But, if I get a chance,
I will certainly say something positive. Let me know what you hear about today. Thx.

Re: Tony Blair/EU presidency

Jonathan Powell just sent me the note below, a message from Tony. My views are below the note.

Jonathan's note:
Sid
If Hillary had a chance to say something about TB being a good President of the European Council if asked about it
during her remaining time in Europe that would be v helpful. The Austrian Chancellor has said today he doesn't want TB
because he was for Bush rather than the new Democratic Administration. So something that indicated the new
Administration would work with him — without trying to interfere in internal European processes — would be very
helpful.
Jonathan



My views:

1.   Even those Europeans who might want Blair as EU president might take offense at a direct US endorsement,
considering it an intrusion on a strictly EU only decision. The Europeans, for example, constantly resent US endorsement
of Turkey's membership in the EU.

2.    But Europeans would not take offense at nice words said by you about Blair without an explicit endorsement. The
rap against him is that he's "Bush's poodle," and your positive comments would help erase that taint.
3.    You can have a member of the press ask you about the Austrian comment about Blair or simply about the EU
presidency. Then you can say that this is a decision reserved for EU members but that you have strong and positive
feelings about Blair as an experienced and skilled statesman who has proved he is devoted not only to Europe but also
to strengthening the Transatlantic partnership.
