All is going exceptionally well here. I feel so proud of what you unleashed when you launched LMI. This gender         B1
convening and agenda is very powerful. We have strong delegations from all the countries, incl Burma. Cambodia's Dep
PM opened the conf. Many of the "friends" are here: Australia, NZ, Japan et al.
                                                 Now with the US engaged that has changed and it's being much
positively commented on.
This couldn't be happening in a more propitious time for women and the region.
I explained at the opening that you launched this and there have been many tributes to you.
Also many of the ministers have commented that these issues need to get on the overall asean agenda in a serious way.
See you tom'w!
