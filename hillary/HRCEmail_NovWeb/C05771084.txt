Compliment for you:

"I listened to Hillary's entire speech on the Global Health Initiative.
It was just superb; one of the best development speeches I have heard.
She tied things together as they must be. Please congratulate her for me and tell her I look forward to promoting her
agenda within the DAC."

Cheryl,

I wanted to let you knowthat things seem to be going well in our pursuit of the DAC Chair. Few countries have
committed, but most have made positive comments and say that they want to see who else comes forward. No one has
yet and the candidate window closes on September 30.
The good news is that all of the biggest donors have indicated in one fashion or another that they will not propose a
candidate. Still, the European Commission continues to encourage an EU candidacy. I think they will have a hard time. I
have several "formers" out there working the foreign ministries and development ministers. Your EB folks and USAID
have been great.

I listened to Hillary's entire speech on the Global Health Initiative.
It was just superb; one of the best development speeches I have heard.
She tied things together as they must be. Please congratulate her for me and tell her I look forward to promoting her
agenda within the DAC.

Brian
