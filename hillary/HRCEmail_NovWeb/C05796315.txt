Subject: Russian parliament passes Russia-US adoption law (AP)

MOSCOW (AP) - Russia's       parliament has ratified a long-awaited agreement with the United States which
regulates the adoption of Russian children by Americans.
  The State Duma voted 244-96-2 on Tuesday to pass the bill.
  Russian first voiced its grievances about the fate of Russian children adopted in the United States in 2010
when a 7-year-old Russian boy was sent back to Russia on a one-way plane ticket by his adoptive mother from
Tennessee. The boy's treatment ignited outrage in Russia toward the United States, temporarily halting
American adoptions of Russian children.
   Russia has been a major source of adopted children in the U.S. for two decades. More than 60,000 Russian
orphans have been adopted in the U.S., according to the National Council For Adoption, a U.S. advocacy
nonprofit group.
