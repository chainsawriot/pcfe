Subject:                           Meles



Madam Secretary,
Further to our conversation, Meles' political party, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Front, will convene a party
council tomorrow to nominate a new PM and DPM. Hailemariam, the current acting PM will be the PM nominee. No
name yet for the DPM. Parliament , on break until October, is expected to be recalled into session to vote on the PM
and DPM likely on Thursday or Friday of this week so there should be a smooth transition of government, even given
that Meles' loss is a very big one for Ethiopia, Africa and for all of us. The funeral is expected next week and the date will
be decided tomorrow. A/S Carson believes that any successor will be more autocratic and authoritarian, less receptive
to us and more ethnic tension is likely. Johnnie is working with Cheryl and Jake on message, call and funeral
arrangements.
Best,
Wendy
