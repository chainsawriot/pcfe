I've attached a draft of my response to Anne Marie's Atlantic piece. I think I mentioned to you that I continue to
be concerned about how we frame some of these issues. It seems to be me that in order to move forward we
need to engage a broader section of the population ( yes, that would be men!!) and the only way to do that is to
appeal to their enlightened self-interest e.g. work-life balance is not just a women's issue; doing better in this
domain improves business outcomes; etc. Anyway that's my approach. Will let you know if I can get it picked
up anywhere.

Have a great trip. Wish I were going with you. Let me know if you come across any great businesses!!!
