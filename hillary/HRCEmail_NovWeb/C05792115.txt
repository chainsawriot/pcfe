Subject: Gillard Returning to Australia

Colleagues;

I'm sure you've heard from the advance already, but we are passing on the news that, due to the deaths of 5 Australian
servicemembers in Afghanistan, PM Gillard has cut short her stay in the Cooks and returned to Australia. This will
obviously drop the bilat on the schedule. We are working to confirm but believe the trilat is still going forward as
planned. This also means Gillard will not attend the women's event. We're also working to find out if Australia plans to
send anyone to that in her stead. S/GWI should probably revise comments referencing Gillard for that event. We will
pass on any additional info we get about Australia's presence at PIF during S time there. Thanks very much,

David Atkinson
Deputy Director
EAP/ANP
