If we can't get them today, I'll do them later. And both CVC and I will sign for JVM.

That could be tricky. The three we have were shipped by Conde Nast in advance of public availability. But let me work
on tracking them down.

And now that I think about it, you know who might love something like this? Giving Jonathan Van Meter a signed
Vogue.

That's very nice of you. We'll get a bunch more for this and also for you to have. Only others coming to mind are Paul
Narain (he quickly wired all the permissions once we decided to shift countries), and maybe Barbara & Isabelle. When I
get the copies I'll also provide a full list.

Thought you'd like to see the cover of Traveler. We only have hard copies (which we'll bring in), so this is an actual
photograph Caroline took of the cover.
