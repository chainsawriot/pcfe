          Outrage at   Afghan minister's prostitution comments

                       KABUL, June 18, 2012 (AFP) - Rights activists on Monday demanded
          the sacking of the Afghan justice minister after he suggested women's
          shelters in the war-torn country were home to "immorality and
          prostitution".
                       Justice minister Habibullah Ghaleb told a conference organised
          by the women's affairs committee of the upper house of parliament on Sunday
          that foreign-funded rights awareness groups had been encouraging young
          women to defy their parents.
                       "Mostly they were encouraging girls, saying, 'If your father
          says anything bad to you don't listen to him, if your mother says anything
          to you don't listen to them. There are safe houses for you where you can

  stay'," the minister said.
               "What safe houses? What sort of immorality and prostitution was
  not happening at those places?"
               Significant progress has been made on women's rights since the
  fall of the Taliban, but many fear those gains are under threat as NATO
  troops leave and Kabul seeks peace with Islamist insurgents.
               Twelve shelters in Afghanistan house around 250 women, most of
  them victims of domestic violence, according to the Women's Affairs
  Ministry. They are mostly run by charities and funded largely by
  international donors.
               Leading Afghan women's rights campaigner Wazhman Frogh said
  Ghaleb's allegations were untrue and urged President Hamid Karzai sack him.
               "We are demanding the president fire the minister for his
  remarks," she said.
               The Afghan Women's Network, the country's leading women's rights
  group, also called for an apology and said the officials involved should be
  removed.
               Sayeda Muzhgan Mustafahi, deputy women affairs minister, said
  the shelters were inspected every week and there was "no evidence to back
  up the minister's statement".
               The deputy justice minister, Sayed Yousouf Aleem, also distanced
  herself from Ghaleb's comments.
               "There is no official report to indicate that the shelters are
  used for immoral activities. We have no evidence," she said.
               Under the Taliban regime from 1996 until the 2001 US-led
  invasion, girls were banned from going to school, women were whipped in the
  street if they did not wear the burqa and those accused of adultery were
  stoned to death, often in public.
               In the past 10 years, the number of girls in education has
  soared and women's employment opportunities have improved, but there have
  been ominous signs for the future.
               In March, Karzai endorsed an edict by the Ulema Council, the
  country's highest Islamic authority, saying that women were worth less than
  men, and should avoid mixing with men.
               That effectively implied that women should not go to university
  or out to work.
