Coco and Phil Gelman just came back and are sharing outcomes: Here is the quick summary we promised.

The who, what, where is still evolving. It will continue to do so as facts on the ground change.

Artibonite and San Marc:

1. There is a plethora of materials available, including enough emergency WASH stock to cover the needs of 500,000 for
one month. (1.2 million aqua tabs and I million bars of soap). There are also (approx. 150,000) hygiene kits available. In
fact the issue is diminishing warehouse space.

2. The key issue right now is not supplies but the on-the-ground mechanics for delivering what to whom. For example,
we have trucks piled with cots and beds ready to go, but we do not always have specified recipient or location. That is
being worked out.

3. MINUSTAH is constructing two field hospitals at 200 beds each. One in L'Estere and one in San Marc. They should be
completed by tomorrow morning.

4. You may still get reports that "nothing has arrived" but that is not equal to nothing is available in country - since there
is now a fairly accurate count of what is in country and how long it will take to get to a given point. The issue is
pinpointing the recipient tonight.

PaP Preparedness Planning:

1. Planning for this is underway.

2. DINEPA indicates that there is sufficient water and purification materials available in PaP. The issue being worked out
is the NGO network to distribute water in camps and neighborhoods. We already have small units for the CTCs sitting in
Miami as well as ten bladders (10,000 liters) in 10Ms possession.

3. The MOH wants to preposition at least 6 (Cholera Treatment Centers (CTCs). This is the cornerstone of their plan.

4. The IFRC (Red Cross) has agreed to do two of the centers (Capacity of 1,200 - in batches of 200).

5. OFDA is looking at doing a CTC in PAP.

6. We expect that the other three will be spoken for within the next twenty-four hours (e.g., MSF and other NGOs of
comparable capacity are expected to volunteer).



7. On this end, we are doing estimates, regarding the speed with which USAID and other donors can get planned CTCs in
place, as well as their capacity do additional ones as estimated.

8. Finally, CDC's SWAT team just arrived this afternoon. Their calculations and preliminary recommendations should
start becoming available shortly.
