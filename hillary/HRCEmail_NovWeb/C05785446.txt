Cheryl -

What time zone are you in??

Thank you for the list. I also discovered the state department's ranking system of embassies that is based roughly on
size, from 1 to 5+.

But I think that for a political appointee it makes the most sense for me to frame my request in terms of G8 or G20.
(Most 5+ embassies have career ambassadors, all but one G8 are political).

There is also the fact that if the rumor mill is true, and           relocates to DC, there will be only one woman in
G20, and still none in G8. While I heard you loud and clear re this strategy, it remains part of the argument that Leader
Pelosi, and Senators Feinstein and Snowe want to use.

      has reached out to the WH to make a request. But we are still a little in the dark, and hoping you could discreetly
advise us, on countries where there might be an opening before next summer. Of course, it would need to be a place
where you and the Secretary also felt I could represent the US effectively.

Right now,                                     Mostly because we know (in the case of India) or think (in the case of
Australia) that they will open up.

ANY other countries that you think would be possibilities, we would very much appreciate a heads up. Of course we will
be very discreet, since it is not likely to be public information.

Finally, I want to thank you and the Secretary for all of your help in the Herculean task of getting me here in the first
place. It is a joy, every day.

Best,
