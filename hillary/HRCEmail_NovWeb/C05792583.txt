Subject:                           Message from Hina Rabbani Khar



Madam Secretary:
Hello from Islamabad. I had a good sit-down with FM Khar who asked me to directly share her appreciation for your
strong statement regarding Malala Yousafazi.

The clerics have a choice at Friday prayers --- do they speak out against the Taliban and violence against a 14 year-old
girl, or do focus on producing another round of protests against the USA? Important choice.

Alec
