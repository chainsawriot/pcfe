ABUJA, Aug 9 (Reuters) - The United States wants to help Nigeria fight Islamists
it sees as a growing regional menace, but it cannot rely on military might alone,
an official travelling with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said.

Clinton arrived in Africa's most populous nation on Thursday offering to help
President Goodluck Jonathan fight Boko Haram, a Taliban-like group that wants to
establish a strict Islamic state in the north of the vast country.

Boko Haram has launched bomb and gun attacks on churches this year that
provoked Christians to deadly reprisals against Muslims. Hundreds of people have
died and Washington is concerned about insecurity spreading.

"Northern Nigeria also borders Chad, it borders Cameroon, it borders Niger and
we are concerned this radicalism could undermine the security of neighbouring
states," the senior U.S. official said.

Jonathan's critics say he is over-reliant on the military to defeat Boko Haram,
rather than addressing northerners' grievances, such as poverty and

unemployment and Clinton will lean on him to address the underlying causes of
the insurgency.

"A security strategy is not enough," the official said.

Military crackdowns have had mixed results - reducing Boko Haram's capabilities
in some areas but generating anger because of their heavy handedness.

Washington will offer Nigeria help with things like forensics, tracking of suspects
and "fusing" disparate strands of police and military intelligence, the U.S. official
said.

"We know all too well from our own experiences in both Iraq and Afghanistan
what can happen if soldiers and police are not operating under appropriate
authorities."

"We will encourage them not to use excessive force and to look at this as a ... law
enforcement operation designed to catch perpetrators and bring them to justice,"
he added.

Clinton will also address a law on oil production that has been stuck in parliament
for more than five years leaving majors like Exxon and Chevron uncertain about
the regulatory future in Africa's biggest crude producer.

The official said Clinton would urge a "fair and predictable environment" for oil
companies in the Petroleum Industry Bill.

"If a bill comes out which appears to undermine the interest of companies, they
won't invest," the official said.
