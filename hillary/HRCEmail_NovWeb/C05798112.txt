To show you how many more paths the President has to 270, he can lose Florida AND lose Ohio AND lose
Virginia - and still win by sweeping Iowa, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, Colorado, Nevada - which is very
doable.

Bottom line, Ohio is the ballgame. It's Obama's firewall. Even if Romney wins Florida AND Virginia, losing
Ohio requires him to not only run the table but steal back pretty solid blue states. The President's lead in Ohio
definitely thinned after the 1st debate, but not enough to make the state a toss up, and whatever damage was
done the bleeding was stopped, the #s have stabilized, and they still solidly favor the President.

So I'm sticking to my prediction of 303 EVs

While it's always one of the quadrennial stupid stories, I can actually construct a 269-269 tie more easily than
Romney outright clearing 270 (0 wins Ohio, but loses VA, NV, CO, IA).

The Obama folks have multiple paths either with or without Ohio. *Romney can't win without Ohio. *A very
interesting statistic, if Kerry had performed as well in 2004 as Obama did in 2008 among the African American
vote, he would have won Ohio. • And the Obama team is maximizing that vote. There has been a lot of writing
about the race divide in the polls but that is mostly because of the lopsided margins in the South - the racial
disparities are not as stark in the Midwest. *

*If Obama wins Ohio, all he needs is to win Nevada or Iowa and he has over 270 electoral votes. *Jon
Ralston has been analyzing the early vote totals in Nevada and the Clark County margins - if they continue on
track, the early vote will provide a firewall for Obama in Nevada. The Democratic registration drive that
recently ended in Nevada led to a 90000 voter edge for Dems. *While Republican participation rates are
higher, more Dem registered voters means they don't need as high a participation rate as Republicans.

Even if Obama loses Ohio and Florida, he can still get to 275 if he wins Colorado and Virginia where recent
polling has the President leading. And even if the President loses Colorado as well, he can get to 270 with
VA, Iowa and NH. •

For Me, I'll be watching Ohio and Virginia, especially Ohio. - if either goes the President's way, hard to see him
losing.

 MS -

Rather than rely on the Google to see how Ohio looked at this same point in '04, I went to a far more reliable
resource: I asked Andrew. Of course, he'd already looked into it yesterday. *Below is his take.

Andrew, can you please also lay out why you and I are so confident overall in our belief that the President will
win re-election, how the map has always been and remains too tough for Romney to overcome.

Funny you should ask. *Nate Cohn of the New Republic's Electionate blog just posted on this yesterday and I
read so you don't have to. *See post and chart below. *Bottom line, until about Oct 25, Kerry was up about
1-3. Then right around now, the polls uniformly shifted to Bush (except for Gallup). *Election day was Nov.
2 in 2004, its November 6 this year. *So polling this week will start to tell us if there is the same shift.
*BTW - the field date for the University of Cincinnati poll that shoes a tie end on Oct. 23 and the CNN poll
showing Obama up by 4 in Ohio ended October 25 so don't think you can use that tied poll it as evidence of a
shift. As Nate Silver pointed out, if Obama is up by two in Ohio, some polls will show him up four and some
will show ties or even him down one. *

2004 And The Possibility Of A Shift In Ohio With just ten days to go, its an open question whether Mitt
Romney can make a comeback in Ohio. As Nate Silver noted today , the polls are getting accurate at this late
stage, and the odds strongly favor Obama maintaining a lead in Ohio polls heading into Election Day . That
might be especially true this y ear, since the polls have been remarkably consistent, Obama has already banked
a lead among early voters, and it's hard to imagine advertisements making a late difference after months of
airing beyond saturation levels. If Obama still leads by 2 or 3 points in Ohio in ten day s, the risk of a Romney
victory would hinge on the possibility of a sy stemic error in the polls. It happens, but not especially often.
Still, while the odds are against a late Romney turnaround, it's not impossible. Its worth recalling the Ohio
polls from this time in 2004, which showed Kerry tied or slightly ahead. Starting with the polls conducted over
these very dates eight y ears ago, Bush took a slight and consistent lead in Ohio and never relented. From this
point onward, Kerry only led in one poll of Ohio (Gallup, of course)
