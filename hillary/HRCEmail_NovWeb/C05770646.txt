Dear Cheryl, Huma and Jake:

I know that Bill Burns has passed on to you that I was looking at a couple of proposals from the private sector. I wanted
to let you know that I have just accepted
                             but I would guess I will depart around Labor Day or shortly after.




Deep thanks to you all for your tremendous support and guidance these nearly two years.


Warmest regards,
