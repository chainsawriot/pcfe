Subject: The QDDR tasking for standing up the new energy bureau

Paul and Matt:

 Thank you so much for agreeing to provide management and guidance for the tasking of defining the mission, scope,
â€¢organizational framework and implementation strategy for the new energy bureau. I am grateful for your commitment
 of your time, collaboration, and leadership on this important effort.

We will be formally tasking Carlos Pascual with ultimate accountability for this QDDR deliverable and appreciate your
support to him in this endeavor and, until his arrival, your coordination here of the planning, collaboration and
engagement necessary to move forward and keep to the 6 month timeline.

 I am copying Dana who provide you with the qddr implementation guidance from S and associated material. She will
 also meet with you to get you up to speed and Carlos, who attended the qddr kickoff meeting, will reach out to connect
 with you both directly so that you all can collaborate on the undertaking ahead.

 Carlos' agreement to assume this role has not yet been publicly announced so we would welcome your discretion in not
 sharing that information until we do so.

 Please let me know if you have any questions; Dana and Carlos also will provide substantive guidance about the specific
 tasking and qddr implementation process.

 Again, I really appreciate your willingness to take on this work.

 Best
 Cdm
