  I am on train to nyc so any time for a call works - I like the Ray Kelly idea and was going to call him but determined not to
  given the politics.

  Email me when I can call you. Also, if necessary, ask Howard if I should call Ray Kelly instead of or in addition to the
  Mayor.

  He advised it is best to assume he "is sleeping" in response to my ques at midnight as to whether he was punting.

  I asked him to call me anyway by 8am
