Dear Jeff

I am following up on our conversation on Sunday. I am copying Ted to whom I had first raised this potential approach on
a call two weeks ago.

Please find below the draft of the proposed approach I received.

After reviewing it and discussing as you deem appropriate internally, I would welcome a discussion regarding: 1)
whether to proceed; 2) the mechanism for the coverage of these expenses consistent with our regulations and
guidelines; 3) timeline for proceeding and 4) assurances that this satisfies the issues that have been raised by HAK
regarding his historical materials.

Many thanks — hope this gets us there.

Best.

The following is a three phase approach to reviewing the "Kissinger" papers that are currently at the
Library of Congress (LOC). Estimated costs below based on what we understand is a collection of
approximately 250,000 pages of State Department documents. If the volume is higher or lower, the
estimated costs would adjust accordingly.

With respect to the protocols outlined below, Department officials would bring the actual documents
from the LoC collection to the Department for Phases 2 and 3 to ensure the primary source collection
at the LoC properly is tagged with classification/declassification markings (thus, we would not review
materials on online on the RAC because that process would not permit tagging of documents as
they were identified).


       Phase 1: Collection Assessment: $75K
          • Initial assessment and identification of unique State records (those records that
             potentially are not part of State record collection at NARA)
          • 882 effort hours @$85/hour (average rate for regular/senior reviewer contract costs)
          • Copying costs for the unique State records (to compare with/supplement the State
             record collection at NARA): TBD

       Phase 2: Administrative Processing: $113K
          • Boxing, inventorying, transporting, and listing the entire collection of State documents
             (to record review decisions)
          • 3,530 effort hours @ $32/hour (estimated rate for contractor support services)

       Phase 3: Document Review: $4.56M
          • Review and mark (with declassification stamp, as appropriate) the entire collection
             (estimated 250,000 pages) including any hand-written annotations
          • 53,650 effort hours - including interagency coordination - @$85/hr

       TOTAL COST: $4.75M


It is important to note that this review would be done in accordance with the Department's standard
practice for historical records, which is to declassify a document in full or withhold it in full. To redact
portions of a document would require a much more time-consuming, labor-intensive and expensive
review such as we did for the telephone "transcripts." (Note: In a rough order of magnitude, based
on the actual costs of that exercise, it could cost over $13M to complete a review involving
redactions of the LoC material from HAK's tenure as SecState.)
