               Secretary of State Hilary Rodham Clinton Tours Africa
               Secretary of State Hilary Rodham Clinton toured Africa last month. The trip focused on
               numerous policy issues including democracy and governance, economic growth, peace
               and security, and women's empowerment.

               While on the continent, Secretary Clinton became the first U.S. Secretary of State to visit
               Malawi, swore in a new class of Peace Corps volunteers in Senegal, and visited with
               former South African President Nelson Mandela. Her stops in sub-Saharan Africa along the
               way included Senegal, South Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, Nigeria,
               Ghana, and Benin.

        Corps to educate young village girls on family health issues and income generation ideas

        In Case You Missed It
        Here are some of the top stories from the White House bloq:

        18th Anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act
        Through programs funded by this groundbreaking legislation, police officers and
        prosecutors are now trained to understand the needs of victims, specialized law
        enforcement units investigate these crimes, and transitional housing programs help victims
        rebuild their lives. As a result, annual rates of domestic violence have dropped by more
        than 60 percent since the passage of the Act, but more work remains to be done.

        Happy Birthday, Air Force!
        Our nation's youngest branch of the military celebrates its 65th birthday today.
