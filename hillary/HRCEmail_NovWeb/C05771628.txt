Both Mubarak and Abdullah are strongly supportive of our current, short term approach. Mubarak sees Abbas Tues and
will advise him to maintain in public and at Sirte that he is ready for direct talks in the right circumstances, and Egypt will
support him. Abdullah of same mind, but focused on making sure Abbas makes the right presentation. Abbas was pulling
up to compound as we were pulling out. I plan to get readout                                       said the task at Sirte would
be easier with 'something' more to work with.                                                                               B1
