Dan, Mira, Lynn â€”

As you'll all recall, in early July the organizers of World Pride presented an award to Secretary Clinton for her work on
LGBT human rights globally. S accepted the award via video and Political MC Toby Bradley gave a personal acceptance
speech as well.

On top of the award, an American artist made the attached flag in honor of the Secretary. It's a take on the American
Flag and has the words of her speech in Geneva sewn in to the flag. Those countries where same-sex relations are
criminalized appear as "dark hole" stars, those where criminalization laws have been removed appear as white stars. As
countries decriminalize, the dark holes become white stars. There are a lot more details (Clinton and Eleanor
Roosevelt's silhouettes, for instance) that make this work of art a really impressive piece.

It is currently hanging in the entrance lobby at Embassy London and is having a dramatic impact there. The hope is that
S will be able to be photographed with it hanging there at some point. Further discussions are ongoing about how best
to use this artwork, and where is might eventually land (museum, Clinton Library, Art in the Embassy program, etc...).
