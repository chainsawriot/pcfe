Dear Huma,

Please keep this confidential. Could you give this to Hillary?

Thank you,

Dear Hillary,

I want to let you know I will be going to Rwanda in mid June for their National Day of Forgiveness and taking
women leaders from other nation's. Jeannette Kagami and Aloisea Inyumba have been friends since our first
trip there and they have invited us to the event. We are going to be there for 3 days early to focus on the
friendship and on what is of true value. These women have attended the National Prayer Breakfast through the
years. We are dreaming for a Revolution of Love. The division and hate is our biggest problem. If we can get
our relationships right, we can solve our problems so these women want to be a voice in their nation. To
encourage "treating others the way you want to be treated." I just got off the phone with our Ambassador Don
Koran, discussing the trip with him. I just thought I would let you know that I am planning on going.
