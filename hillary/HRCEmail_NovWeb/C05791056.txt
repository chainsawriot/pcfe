Subject:                              DoS report shows Palau continues as top voter w/US in UN
Attachments:                          Voting Practices in the UN.pdf; ATT00001.htm



Palau continues to vote with the U.S. in the U.N. more than any other member. Attached is the latest State
Dept. report on U.N. votes preceded by a chart summarizing voting with the U.S. distilled from the report.
Your help is needed to get the 2010 Agreement to continue free association between the US & Palau approved
by Congress, where there is universal support for it but universal disagreement with the Administration's
proposed offsets. Jeff Farrow
