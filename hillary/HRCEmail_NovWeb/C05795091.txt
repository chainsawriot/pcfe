Thanks so much, I'm glad to hear it might compliment your work.

Melanne and Cheryl, it would be great to pick your brains about how this initiative could add the most value to
the work already being done. I'd be glad to swing by anytime for that - and it would be great to catch up.

 Doug--

 This sounds complimentary to our ongoing efforts. I'm copying Melanne and Cheryl so we can be sure to consult and
 coordinate.

 All the best--H

 Welcome back from what seems to have been a good tour. Your coverage was phenomenal.

 I though you might like to know about recent work I've been doing, which might be of interest to you moving forward. I've
 continued working on issues affecting women and girls, but with a more domestic focus (such as a campaign with
 Planned Parenthood NYC to reduce the 60% unintended pregnancy rate in the city).

 I'm now embarking on an ambitious effort funded by the Woodcock Foundation (which I'm sure will attract interest from
 other funders) to develop a new, aspirational narrative about gender equality in America that will motivate the Millennial
 generation to embrace it as their issue.

 We also hope to create a communications and advocacy center to arm movement leaders and grassroots activisits with
 knowledge, skills and tools to be effective communicators for the cause.

 The Millennials' hearts seem to be in the right place on social justice issues, but the leaders we've talked to think the
 movement is not connecting with them in a way that will inspire and engage both women and men. They'll be
 the dominant voting bloc over the next two presidential cycles, and it's time to get them on board and activated.

We're engaging a great group of thinkers and doers to inform the research and development, to ensure that it provides
maximum benefit to people working on all sorts of issues for women and girls. If at any time you would be interested, I'd
love to get your thoughts about it.

All the best, Doug

 Hello Madame Secretary, I hope you're well.

 I just wanted to send thanks and kudos for Cheryl and Nora, who helped
 sort out a mistake at the national passport center that threatened to
 derail                                              I brought it to
 Cheryl's attention, and within a few hours Nora had it resolved.




 I thought you might like to know how they're doing. And of course,
 please let me know if there's ever any way I can be helpful to you.

 All my best, Doug
