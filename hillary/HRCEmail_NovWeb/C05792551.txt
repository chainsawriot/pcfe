Dear Secretary Clinton,

I am both saddened and excited to inform you that I have accepted a clerkship with a new federal district court judge in
the Southern District of California. I am thrilled to jump into the legal aspect of my career, but also sad to leave what has
become a family over the last six years.

I dubbed the name, "Hillaryland 2.0" for the group of young women like me who have learned from you and the original
Hillaryland - Capricia, Cheryl, Melanne, Huma and even new ones, like Maria Otero. The collective guidance and
mentorship from you and these phenomenal women has helped me grow both personally and professionally in an
unparalleled way. I assure you that it's a unique experience, distinguished from any other environment that exists in
Washington for young women. Under your leadership, I feel that I have also become part of the State Department
family, with all the ups and downs that a family inevitably experiences.

I look forward to meeting with you before I leave for San Diego at the end of the month. I know you are incredibly busy,
so I appreciate the opportunity to thank you in person for the opportunities you have given me. I never thought a small
border-town girl like me would have the chance to travel the world representing the United States, and share with
countries all the values that we hold so dear.

I am deeply grateful for the honor to serve with you.

All the best,
Laura
