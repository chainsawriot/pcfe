Subject: RE: Conference Call this a.m.

I agree with PJ and Raj's suggestions. I'd also like to make the point that the terrorist attacks are not just triggered by
USG branding. In fact, as we discussed yesterday, the two incidents referred to in the op ed did not involve branded
programs. I do not in any way mean to undermine the seriousness of the situation but I think it is important to put this in
perspective and show that the threat to civil society in Pakistan is far broader than an attack on USG initiatives.

Lars and Ashley -

I think pj's suggestion makes sense. I would add we might add more info on how we're responding to the threat
environment and regularly consulting w implementing partners. We also need to show a commitment to safety of our
afghan nationals that work for us or our partners. I am happy to review a draft.

On the larger point of our visibility in pakistan, Richard and I have discussed this and we need to implement a much
more aggressive communications strategy that employs more aggressive/modern methods than simply branding. I
know you are wor

Raj
