Hillary Clinton's Africa trip dodges disease, bees, even features a bit of snow and dancing

COTONOU, Benin — On an epic diplomatic mission through Africa, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton braved
an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in Uganda, escaped a swarm of angry bees in Malawi and shimmied on a dance
floor in South Africa, earning the nickname "Secretary of Shake."

Circumnavigating the continent from Senegal to Kenya and back around to Benin, she also engineered an oil deal
between Sudan and South Sudan, read the riot act to bickering politicians in Kenya, visited South African freedom icon
Nelson Mandela and pushed Nigeria's leaders to improve intelligence cooperation.

With her arrival on Friday in Benin, Clinton shattered her own travel record as secretary of state, logging 108 countries
visited in office.
