Subject: Invitation: Secretary Clinton - School of International Service (SIS) Commencement Speaker and Honorary
Degree Doctorate - Sunday, May 12 at lpm. (American University)

 Dear Secretary Clinton/Hillary - (via Cheryl, Huma, and Melannne) - Greetings.

 This is an initial informal email from a member of your greater Clinton "family". A formal invitation to follow,
 but the President of American University (Neil Kerwin) and the Dean of the School of International Service
 (SIS Dean Jim Goldgeier) of American University and I (as the Chairman of the Board of SIS) would like you
 to be the commencement speaker (and receive your Honorary Doctorate from American University) on
 Sunday, May 12th at I pm.

 I would, naturally, love that. Could you do it? We can make this a great moment to share your vision for the
 future and I'd work with you on this address so the messages would amplify. I think this would be a great place
 and time to share your vision and mission. Possible?

 As you know, you and Melanne were just with SIS Dean Jim Goldgeier in NYC to launch the U.S. - Pakistan
 Women's Council that is being housed at AU - with Melanne, serving as its co-chair.

 Let me know how you would like me to proceed. At the outset, I wanted to gauge your interest and
 availability. American University are hoping that I can come back to them with a "yes" -- and so do I. Thanks
 so much for your consideration. I promise that this would be a great event for you.

 Warmest,
 Alan
