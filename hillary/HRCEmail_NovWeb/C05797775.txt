Subject: UPDATE: Sen. Reid discharged after Vegas car crash (AP)

LAS VEGAS (AP) - Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has been discharged from the hospital after a car crash
on an interstate through Las Vegas.
   Hospital spokeswoman Karen Gordon confirms the senator left less than three hours after the crash that
happened about 1:10 p.m. Friday.
   Officials from the Nevada senator's office say Reid suffered rib and hip contusions in the crash, and was
taken to the hospital by his security detail as a precaution.
   Reid officials say other members of the senator's security detail and a staffer had minor injuries and were
taken to the hospital for evaluation.
   Officials say Reid was wearing a seatbelt at the time.
   Troopers say six vehicles were involved in the apparent chain reaction rear-end crash, including two police
vehicles, two Capitol Police vehicles and two civilian vehicles.
