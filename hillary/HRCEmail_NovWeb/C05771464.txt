WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. nuclear scientist saw hundreds of centrifuges in North Korea this month, sources
familiar with the matter said, buttressing the case that Pyongyang has a uranium enrichment program that would give it
a second way to obtain fissile material for bombs.

  One source said the expert, Stanford University's Siegfried Hecker, was told by North Korean officials they had 2,000
centrifuges operating, but the U.S. team that visited the country was unable to verify that.
