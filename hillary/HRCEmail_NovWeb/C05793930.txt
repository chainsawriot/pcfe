Subject: Canada Closes Embassy in Iran, PNGs Iranian Diplomats (U)

(U) The embassy closure takes effect immediately, and Iranian diplomats in Canada have been instructed to
leave within five days, according to a statement from the Canadian Foreign Ministry. The statement said these
steps were due to Iran's support of the Asad regime, refusal to comply with UN resolutions, and threats against
Israel.
