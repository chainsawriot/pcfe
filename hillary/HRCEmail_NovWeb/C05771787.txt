Hi Lauren,
I hope that your Thanksgiving was pleasant, and that you are enjoying a few days of time-off and calm.
Please pass on the message below to the SecState before her upcoming trip to Kazakhstan and the OSCE
summit in Astana.
Thanks, as always.

Hillary,
I hope that your Thanksgiving went well. We have had Strobe with us all week, and it's been a very good visit.


                                                            I got Strobe and Geoff Cowan together, and we are
setting up a loose partnership between Brookings and the Annenberg Retreat at Sunnylands in the desert which
Geoff is now heading, and with which I am assisting in program and strategy. One of these days we hope to get
you to host a summit there or encourage a track II meeting. Your tech man Alex is working with us on a
possible conference at Sunnylands for this spring.
Among our dinner guests last evening was Celeste Wallander and her family. Celeste is Sandy Vershbow's DAS
for Russia at the Pentagon, and she will be going to Kazakhstan as the highest ranking DOD rep for the OSCE
summit next week

Celeste is brilliant about all things Russian, and she has the highest admiration for you. I hope that you will get
a chance to meet her personally during the time in Astana. Strobe and I both hold her in the highest regard as a
Russia expert; she is also a wonderful person, and someone whom I think you'd enjoy getting to know for future
endeavors. Perhaps, Cheryl, Huma, or Lauren can make sure that the two of you get a few moments together,
and that she might be included in one of your more fun events. I assume that you will be appearing live on
Kazakhstan's leading talk show or comedy hour!
Admiral Bill Fallon and his wife Mary also stopped by yesterday for lunch
                                               As you know, Bill is a terrific guy, and holds you in the highest
regard.
We enjoy reading about your adventures from afar--from the West Coast Liberated Zone where Democrats still
rule!
Take Care and Safe Travels in the Central Asian Steppesin 2007, the State Dept sent me to Kazakhstan and I
gave lectures at the diplomatic academy in Astana and spoke at the major universities. Astana is a strange place-
-kind of a Las Vegas in the high plains with architectural monuments but no unifying style. Enjoy the
