   The Honorable Hillary Rodham Clinton
   Secretary of State
   Department of State
   Washington, D. C.

   Dear Madam Secretary:

           I have today informed the President that I will be stepping down as Ambassador to the
   Netherlands, effective September 16, 2011. To be an American Ambassador anywhere is an
   honor. To be Ambassador to the country of my parents' birth has been a unique privilege.
   The thousands of Dutch men and women I have met from all walks of life who have
   welcomed me and supported my work have made me even prouder of that heritage. At this
   time, however, I feel the need to turn more of my attention to my family and to serving the
   public interest closer to our home in Chicago.

           I have been very proud to see how your leadership has inspired so many people in the
   Netherlands â€” both Americans and Dutch. You have set an extraordinarily high standard for
   effectiveness in foreign relations. I have strived to meet that standard, especially in the vital
   areas of equal rights and opportunity for women and girls and in protecting our environment.
   On both issues, the Dutch are our strong partners. I will be forever grateful for the
   opportunity I have had to be a part of the Obama administration on the Clinton team, working
   to improve our relationships all over the world.

          With appreciation and a continuing commitment to the Obama Administration and
   your diplomatic efforts, I remain

                                                  Very truly yours,



                                                  Fay Hartog Levin
                                                  Ambassador
