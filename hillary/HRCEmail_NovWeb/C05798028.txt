Hi,

To follow up our conversation yesterday on what you might do this week,




I'll ask Beth and Robert to prepare call sheets for you to consider, if this makes sense.

We also have Sinirlioglu in town tomorrow, which is another good opportunity to highlight cooperation on transition in
Syria.

All best,

Bill
