Dear Madame Secretary:

I leave Memorial Day for Addis where we expect the negotiations between Sudan and South Sudan to resume. I will also
see Prime Minister Meles, have lunch with the Arab League ambassadors to the AU, and meet with others concerned
with Sudan and South Sudan. Mbeki has indicated he will invite all the principal Sudan envoys to Addis to build
international support for the negotiations, which is a good move. Should the negotiations be delayed, or only last a few
days, I will go on to Juba for consultations with the South Sudan government. I return June 3.




                                                                                                           My colleague
in USSESSS, Ambassador Dane Smith, will be available for travel and representing us during this time. He is fully engaged
on all our policy matters. He will in fact be going to Doha and Khartoum later this month.

                                                                             We will work hard to ensure that our policy
is well managed during this time.
