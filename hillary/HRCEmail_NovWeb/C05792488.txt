Karzai put out the following statement after meeting with Grossman. Not as inflammatory as feared but
not great. Will forward our measured response.

Palace statement:

 President Karzai: Any delay in transferring Afghan prisoners is a serious violation of the MOU signed
                             between Afghanistan and the United States


During a meeting this morning with Ambassador Grossman, President Karzai once again reaffirmed
on the issue of the complete transfer of Bagram Detention Facility to the Afghan sovereignty and the
handover of more than 600 Afghan prisoners who are still under U.S. custody.

President Karzai considered the delay in transferring Afghan prisoners to the Afghan sovereignty after
September 09, as a serious violation of MOU signed between Afghanistan and the United States.

Pointing to the No. 2nd appendix protocol of the Geneva Convention based which the U.S. is justifying
and relying which pave the way for a long term detention of the accused people without trial,
President said that Afghan legal officials will work on matching this part of the convention which is
mentioned in the MOU with the Afghan laws and the Afghan government will soon express its view
accordingly. But, detaining Afghans by Americans does not go with the friendly atmosphere and the
SPA between the two countries.

President Karzai added that Afghans link the issue of detention facilities and prisons to the national
sovereignty, and that respect to the Afghan national sovereignty as an independent country is
mentioned several times in the SPA.

During this meeting, in addition to the above mentioned issues. issues of peace process, and the role
of Pakistan in the peace process were also discussed.
