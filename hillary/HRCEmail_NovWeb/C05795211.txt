Marina is printing:

1. A draft of your remarks at the International AIDS Conference from Josh.
2. An action memo from SRAP. It is a thank you cable and letter for Ambassador Munter. SRAP would like the text of the
cable to be read out aloud at Ambassador Munter's farewell ceremony on Monday; for the cable to arrive in time in
Islamabad, it must go out this weekend but the hard copy of the letter can wait for your signature on Monday.
