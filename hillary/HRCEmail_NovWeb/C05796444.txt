California--I'll take the United flight out. What time do I have to leave LA for Brazil? And will other people on the ream
going meet me down there?

Little Rock--                     so let's look for a commercial flight back for me--after 6am if possible!

Europe--sounds from Jake that David is firm about Israel. Pls confirm w all so we can decide about putting A&A back.
And moving Georgia--again.

Coming back from Memorial Day--Can I get a plane back from White Plains Monday night?
