You simply cannot imagine the outpouring of concern and good wishes for your health that I am encountering
everywhere I go. From taxi drivers to my hairdresser to students to self-professed Republicans, EVERYONE is thinking
about you and hoping you recover quickly. I know in many ways this last six weeks has not been the kind of valedictory
that your staff, friends and supporters imagined and wanted for you. But in other ways your concussion and it
complications has underlined your overall legacy more than anything else could in terms of how the American people
assess the job you have done and the way you have represented them in the world over the past four years. You have
EARNED their admiration, in a job that is traditionally almost invisible to the US public. This outpouring of concern and
affection is the most genuine verdict on your performance you could ask for. And your legac(ies) will become steadily
more visible and important over time.
Get well!
AM
