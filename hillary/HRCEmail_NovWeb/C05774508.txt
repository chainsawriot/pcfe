Empey just told me the Orange Order did NOT vote for it but took a wait and see

attitude. Can you confirm what happened?

Re: NI latest




1.     Shaun got former President George W. Bush to call Cameron yesterday

through Paula Dobriansky, the former special envoy. The report back: Bush

delivered the message, he told Cameron he considered it important for Cameron to

get the UUP to complete the peace conference. Cameron said he was in favor.

2.     This morning the Orange Order that organizes Protestant parades voted to

recommend acceptance of the recent Hillsborough Castle agreement on future

parades by an overwhelming margin, 100-5. Rather than standing outside the

parading commission, this vote is a sign of confidence by Unionism in the new

agreement.

3.     All evidence is that the UUP is trying to make Peter Robinson's life

impossible. On Thursday, March 4, Empey finally produced a document laying out

the UUP position. Among its demands was one for reorganization of the executive,

conceived to undermine the process. Robinson and McGuinness, in fact, have

already asked Empey to head a commission to make recommendations on making the

executive work better. Robinson has told Shaun he is prepared to help Empey on

the education issue, but not if he is unwilling to help on the peace process.

Empey is also making a demand about who can be the justice minister that Shaun

characterizes as "insane." The DUP and Sinn Fein have already created a process

not to nominate someone from their respective parties to be justice minister to

avoid putting in the post whose past is incendiary from Sinn Fein. Empey's

demand to return to the old process is intended as merely a wrecking device.

4.   Shaun is having done a poll of NI public opinion that, if it comes out

well, will be released to the press by Monday. Robinson has shared his private

polling with Shaun that shows more than 86 percent of the NI public support the

agreement.

5.   It is unclear what is going on with Cameron. Is he actually pushing for

the agreement or not? If he is, does he have any influence? Either Cameron is

purposefullly not being strong with Empey or he is being spurned, making calls.

If he is not really pressuring Empey, it would be out of a desperate and vain

attempt to grab a parliamentary seat in the case of a hung parliament—a seat

that is out of his grasp—the Sylvia Hermon seat.

6.   Robinson has previously declared he would resign if the UUP didn't

endorse the agreement. But Shaun says that he's getting signs that Robinson may

be moving away from that position. There is a prospect that Empey's failure to

endorse might not produce meltdown. If so, that would toll the end of the UUP.

Having tried to wreck the agreement, they would be left stranded. If Robinson

stood firm then, didn't resign, triggering new elections, he might well achieve
