Subject:               Meeting - US Security Expansion & Focus

Hillary,
Sorry to bother on State of the Union day, but not a 'social call'. The                               ou met at my house
wants to reach to you. He has a serious proposal he'd like to discuss with you - privately. He took your advice and
established an American water security company last year - and has been successful. However, he'd now like to expand
using his SAS, MI5, MOD UK experience and connections and establish new focus on broader American security. In
addition to linking with               former business partner, he's been involved with DHS, SOCOM & CENTCOM here
and has privately been working with the British Embassy while here in the US - to our mutual advantage of course. In
March he will be going to Texas to meet with Border Patrol personnel. I met with him last week, have read his 'Strict
Confidence' proposal and find it extraordinary. I earnestly believe it is worth your time to meet with          however
briefly, as he would like to get your feedback re his thinking relative to the need for 'enhanced' security here. His
company,             , is the only company of its kind certified by both the US Dept of Homeland Security and the British
Home Office. A serious player.                          were linked in January 2009 and key staff at US DHS tell me
is one of the most highly regarded people in the security game. I knew that, but gratified to hear. Further, he has been
advising the government of Panama at the highest level. Quite the guy. Also, he's considering moving to the US - family
and all. Though he is generally in the UK, he can be in Washington or the location of your choice on 24 hours notice. Pls
advise. Thank you and all the best, Marty
