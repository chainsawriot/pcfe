Subject: Jack Lew's replacement

Hillary,




Specifically, I wanted to drop you this note with the recent encouraging news of President Obama's decision to appoint
Jack Lew to replace Orszag. It seems the President himself is beginning to understand that his team hasn't been up to
snuff and that cutting Clinton Administration people out of big jobs is hurting them.

If you have not made a final decision on who might fill Jack Lew's shoes, I would like to offer some thoughts. The
President rightfully promised to reset State's capabilities. From an outsider's perspective, it seems Defense is still
running the world. Someone who is capable of working the big mega questions like this would be a great asset to you.

You have probably heard by now that                  is interested in being considered for this position. Since this is a
management job and becausEJhad the big management job during the Clinton Administration it may be a natural fit.
I do reco nize that it goes against my own advice to                 at State You may be aware that Madeline had
offered         his position in 95 or 96, but with



I have known        ror many years, although we hadn't kept up much with one another until we found ourselves on
several conference calls together during your campaign. In the 80's and 90's



Recognizing there are so many uncertainties, you might want to consider adding              o your list. I know
would be a strong addition to your team and work seamlessly with Cheryl.

Best to you and President Clinton,

Nancy
