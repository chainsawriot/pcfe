This is from Vital Voices. When I recently met with some of the key women from Haiti they made same point. I hope HRC
can reinforce.

Hi Melanne,

I heard she is meeting with him tomorrow. It would be great if she could press him/or congratulate and thank him on his
commitment (only verbal) to support the Women's Platform in Haiti through the creation of the Haitian Women's
Empowerment Fund - committing $10 million to the effort.

Thank you!
Alyse
