Bee Swarm Attacks Hillary Clinton
By Justin Sink
The Hill
Mon, Aug 6, 2012

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's tour of Malawi had an inauspicious finale on Monday as she and her detail were
targeted by a swarm of bees at the airport.

Clinton and her detail were headed to board her plane at Kamuzu International Airport in the capital, Lilongwe, when a
swarm of bees descended on the farewell gathering. According to press reports, Malawi and American officials all
scampered for cover while Clinton ran onto the jet for cover.

"There was a slight panic as the bees winged across the airport. People could be seen running away to keep cover as the
Secretary of State swiftly boarded her plane to avoid any stings," a witness told the Nyasa Times. Clinton's stay in the
southern African nation was a short six hours, part of an 11-day African tour. From Malawi, Clinton headed to
Johannesburg, South Africa, where she was expected to meet with former president Nelson Mandela. She has already
visited Uganda, South Sudan, and Kenya.

Clinton is the first high-ranking U.S. official to visit Malwai since former Vice President Dan Quayle visited the country in
1991.
