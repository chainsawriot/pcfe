Subject: Senate Holds -- Update

Senator DeMint has signaled he will lift his hold on Secretary Locke's nomination later today. That frees him of all
known holds.

Senator Kirk just indicated to Bill that he will lift his hold on his nomination. That leaves a DeMint hold which we are
actively trying to resolve.
