Madame Secretary — we are very much aware and concerned by all the Cambodian issues — particularly
women's land rights — and we have/will need to continue to tell Phnom Pen that they must be resolved before
ARF. We will do some careful media after your meeting with the DPM. Kurt.

Where are we on the women's land rights issues/hunger strikes? This has potential for big problems for us.
