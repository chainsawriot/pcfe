Subject: Brawls in Egypt court as judges meet on constitution (Reuters)

CAIRO (Reuters) - Brawls broke out in an Egyptian courtroom as judges prepared to issue rulings on Tuesday
that will either bolster the country's new President Mohamed Mursi, or undermine him in his power struggle
with the military.

   With his allies in the Muslim Brotherhood hailing a "decisive" day in the country's democratic transition,
hundreds of Mursi supporters came to protest at the courthouse, accusing the generals of using the judiciary to
undermine his authority.

   With opinion split on how the Cairo administrative court would rule, tension was high as lawyers, protesters
and members of the public pushed and elbowed one other.

   "Down, down with military rule," shouted supporters of the Brotherhood, drawing an angry response from
their opponents.

   "Down, down with the rule of the (Brotherhood's) Supreme Guide," shouted a woman as the courtroom
descended into mayhem.

   "I have never seen a courtroom like this anywhere in the world. This is no way for us to work. Do you call
this justice?" said one lawyer, Khaled Fouad.

  Judge Abdel Salam El-Naggar arrived and told the crowd "Your presence here will not intimidate the court".
He suspended the session to allow time for the atmosphere to cool.

   The power struggle unleashed by the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak last year has shifted from the streets to
the ballot box and now the courts as Islamists vie for influence with their perennial adversaries in an army-led
establishment.

  At Tuesday's hearings judges will decide if an assembly drafting a new constitution should be scrapped.
They will also hear appeals against decrees by the military and one from Mursi that recalled an Islamist-
dominated parliament that the generals had dissolved.

   "Everybody should know that the conspiracy against Parliament will end in failure, as will the conspiracy
against the constituent assembly and the constitution, and the president himself," said Essam al-Erian, leader of
the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, in al-Ahram newspaper.

    Brotherhood supporters warned the army not to undermine the country's new elected institutions.

   "Who elected the constitutional assembly? Parliament. And who elected parliament? The people. We are the
ones to determine our fate," said 20-year-old student Ahmed Mohamed el-Sayed, a member of the
Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party (FJP).

   On its Facebook page, the FJP declared the Cairo administrative court's deliberations "decisive" for the
nation.
