Subject: Juncker



Per one of the points raised in the Sec's eurozone e-mail — guess Juncker won after all.

Jean-Claude Juncker, Luxembourg's prime minister, won another term as president of the eurozone
group of finance ministers as compatriot and inflation hawk Yves Mersch claimed the vacant seat on
the European Central Bank's six-member executive board.

The appointments were announced following a meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Brussels in
which the group also asked Germany's Klaus Regling, the managing director of the eurozone's
temporary bailout fund, to lead its successor, the €500bn European Stability Mechanism, when it
comes on line later this year.
