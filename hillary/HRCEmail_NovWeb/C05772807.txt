Although Istanbul is one of my favorite cities, I am exhausted just reading this. I will
look forward to hearing about the opening of the exhibit about your mothers. I am sure it
will be quite moving.

As for dates in July, the truth is I would come down to OC in a nano second when you are
available. But, if it makes it easier for you to plan, the following dates would work:
Friday, July 6th
JulylOth - 13th
July July 16th-19th

Take care and thank goodness you have been blessed by a strong constitution.




Love and kisses,
Jill

Hi, Jill--

Greetings from Istanbul!

I wish I were going to be home this weekend but, alas, am not. Getting back to DC from this too-long trip and then
heading to Little Rock for the weekend w my entire family for the opening of the library's exhibit on Bill's and my
mothers' lives.

                                                                                          after which I fly to Mexico to
meet the President, back to DC for two days, then to Brazil, then Europe again---you get the picture of this nutty
schedule
I'm living.

So, let's look for another time to visit. Can you send me dates in June and July when you could come to DC?

I'm sure well figure it out---H

                                       I know your time is precious but, if you can spare
half an hour over the weekend, I would love to stop by and catch up.

Love,

Jill
