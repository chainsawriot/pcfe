Subject: Former NY mayor helping Serbia's nationalists (AP)



  BELGRADE (AP) - Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani says he could become an adviser to Serbian
nationalists who were once allied with the late autocrat Slobodan Milosevic if they win an election race for the
capital.
   Giuliani said Friday that he, and his consulting company, will be advising the Serbian Progressive Party
officials, if they win power in Belgrade after May 6 elections. The party is challenging the ruling pro-EU
coalition at the polls.
   Giuliani says that "we would be very honored to help."
   Giuliani's visit angered Belgrade's current mayor, Dragan Djilas, who blasted the former New York mayor
for his support of NATO's 1999 bombing of Serbia and its capital.
  Djilas says Giuliani "is not the man to speak about the future of Belgrade."
