Subject: Dan Kurtzer on Egypt

(SBU) Just FYI. Dan Kurtzer came by yesterday and chatted with Alex Djerassi and me on a variety of
NEA topics. But I thought a couple of his points on Egypt were particularly interesting. First, he said
(what is perhaps obvious but Dan said it articulately) that all three major groups in Egypt -- the SCAF,
the Islamist parties, and the liberal groups -- all distrust us. The SCAF prefers to blame us for the ousting
of Mubarak than do any kind of self-examination. The Islamist parties view us with suspicion for our
historic role, baggage, etc. The liberal groups see us as flirting both with the SCAF and the Islamist
groups.

(SBU) At the same time, Dan gave us very high marks for what we collectively are doing. We are
spending a lot of time with the SCAF, reassuring them of the strategic important of the Egyptian-U.S.
and the mil-mil relationships. We are engaging the MB in ways we never did before. And we
continue to try to push for liberal, credible, democratic norms, laws, etc. In Dan's view, we have no
political capital to draw on (given the distrust issue), but we are doing a good job in essentially
starting from scratch in doing the hard diplomatic work of rebuilding the trust in those three groups.

(SBU) We also, inter alia, compared notes on presidential candidates. Dan sees the MB machine as
being able to tip the balance toward a preferred candidate, and he does not see Amre Moussa
emerging as that candidate. He raised the name of Ahmed Shafiq as a possibility (as has Anne
Patterson), and he also mentioned Mansour Hassan, a name not familiar to me but probbbly known
to the Embassy. Dan described Hassan as essentially an eminence grise who has a good reputation
throughout Egypt for public service years ago. In Dan's description, he was not a Mubarak insider
and did not profit from the privatization of state assets. Dan said that he has heard his name
mentioned as a possibility.

(SBU) Dan is obviously just one of many observers of the Egyptian scene, but he's got good
experience, of course. So I thought it worth passing on his comments that he thinks we're doing the
right thing in our engagement strategy -- Dan does not hesitate to criticize the Administration when

he finds fault! Dan had some tactical suggestions (nothing earth-shattering) on the NGO issue and
other things that I'll incorporate in our discussions.
