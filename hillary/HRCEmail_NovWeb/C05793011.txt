It went very well. Rep. Cantor seemed very pleased to visit the three Caricol sites and took the most interest in the
housing since he told us he has a professional background in doing legal work for land development projects. Thus
establishing the site for the industrial development area also seemed the kind of project he was also familiar with and
seemed very comfortable with the concept. He had very many straightforward questions about Hatian history, economics
and had very comfortable conversations with contractors, the head of the Korean firm, and project managers. I think he
was struck with local wage scales and praised the work he saw. We talked in passing about future local elections, the
drug trade, security issues in port au prince, programs to stregthen the police. He immediatelly agreed that police
numbers seemed low per capita. He came accross as truly interested in understanding Haiti-better and complemented
people throughout for their work. Steve may have more to add.

Embassy PaP colleagues,

The H Assistant Secretary is wondering how Codel Cantor went; he mentioned it to the Secretary this morning and she
expressed an interest. Could one of you please provide a quick read-out? If you'd rather do that by phone, my direct
line is 202-647-9477. Thanks!

JJB
