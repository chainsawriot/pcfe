Again, truly amazing work by all to get to this point. Very proud to be part of this great team

Obviously, we are most focused on the next 15 hrs and will talk again at 10 pm

But my own thought-I am in New Haven til Mon.                                      . As I mentioned on the call, if those    B6
on this email see no problems, I would propose to come to ny mon nite after the grad festivities end here. I should get
there around 9 pm and crash.

I would then go over to nyu-wash sq village around 9 am tue ams to meet up w/ Kin to get in, and spend some time with
him, his family, Jerry, Frank Upham and others w an eye toward a noon or afternoon departure.

That way I can find out more about

1 what we need to know re how he fared at hospital in his interactions w chinese authorities
2 his passport status, what if any papers he may have signed, what they told him re his immigration status etc.,
3 the likely nyu course of study
4 his hopes and plans for the next few weeks (inc press and leg engagements).

I would hope to spend a lot of time also w Jerry making sure we are on the same page.

I would also try to go to see John Sexton if he is there to thank him for everything

I could report back to all of you to see if there is any need to stay longer, and if not, head down to dc tues nite or wed
am.
