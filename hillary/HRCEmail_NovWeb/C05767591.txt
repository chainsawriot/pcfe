Subject:                           your meeting with Egyptian FM


I know you have much bigger issues on your agenda, but I wanted to tell you 2 things if useful for your meeting with
Egyptian FM:

* there will be a meeting in the next week or so to follow up on the meeting we had last week with
Egypt's Dep FM regarding Egypt's support for Afghanistan. When she was here, she indicated that Egypt would be willing
to provide assistance for programs that help women, particularly vocational training and religious training (the latter so
women can get a more progressive view of Islam). Their willingness to help in whatever form will finally be determined is a
positive development.

*Secondly, you are doing the event to mark the 15th anniversary of the Cairo conference tom'w. We have invited the
Ambassador Shoukry and his deputy. When we had the meeting with the Egyptian Dep. FM, we learned that the #2 at the
Egyptian embassy in DC spent two years working on the Cairo document.
