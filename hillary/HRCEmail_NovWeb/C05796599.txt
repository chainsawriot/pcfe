Subject: Today's 9:15 Discussion on DRC

Hi Jake,

Hope you're well. I heard through the grapevine that Melanne Verveer briefed on a few DRC-related items today at the
9:15 and I'm not sure she had the latest information, so just wanted to pass to you in case you are interested.

First, I heard that she said that the Central Bank in Goma had been looted and that all the gold had been removed. I
double-checked with post and we understand that M23 attempted to rob the bank, but that MONUSCO (which is
conducting 84 daily patrols in Goma) intervened and was able to recover everything that M23 started to take out. (They
did this without a fight.) At this time, the bank is not missing anything.

Second, I heard that she said that M23 had blocked the roads and no food was getting into Goma. It is true that M23
controls the roads and the airport, but there is food inside the city and humanitarian actors are able to travel into and
out of Goma. Humanitarian aid delivery continues despite the airport's closure, as supplies continue to arrive in Goma
via truck and from the Goma/Gisenyi, Rwanda land border. Humanitarian staff in Goma have been able to reach over
110,000 people in each of the last two days with water and sanitation materials; and WFP's food distributions have been
largely uninterrupted for the more than one million people in North Kivu who are food-insecure. This is not to say that
we do not need to keep a close eye on the situation, but, under current conditions, there is not a risk of food running
out in Goma.

As an aside, I also heard that the Secretary discussed yesterday with AU Chair Dlamini-Zuma the issue of mobile banking
for DRC troops. She might be interested in knowing that electronic payments have indeed started, through given the
many logistical challenges in DRC, they do not cover all of the DRC military.



Thanks,
Madeeha
