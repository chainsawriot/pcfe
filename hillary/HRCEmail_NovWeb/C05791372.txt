From:                            Jeffrey L Farrow
Sent:                            Thursday, July 19, 2012 7:41 PM
To:                              Kurt M Campbell
Cc:                              Jake Sullivan; Thomas R Nides
Subject:                         Full Foreign Affairs OK of Palau Bill



Heard from Chm. Ros-Lehtinen this aft. that she was discharging the Palau Continued Free Association bill with the
substitute offset we suggested that I understand State supports (regarding denial of passports to individuals with
seriously delinquent tax debts exceeding $50,000) from the full Foreign Affairs Committee. As you probably know, it
passed the Subcommittee yesterday. It came at the right time, Palau was running out of patience after 22+ months!
Hope we can work together for the expeditious Natural Resources Committee approval Chairman Hastings pledged
when I took Pres. Toribiong in, making substantial progress before the August recess (and your stop in Palau).
