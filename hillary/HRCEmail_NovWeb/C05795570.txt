This email is like so many on the terrible situation in DRC with M23.
Dr. Mukwege is clearly worried that as the M23 advance toward Bukavu, Panzi hospital will be terrorized. Eve Ensler's
City of Joy is also feeling desperate.
We were able to get supplies to Heal Africa in Goma and, as you can see, efforts are being made to get other key
workers out of harm's way. I hope there's a political solution but it seems very elusive. Your plate is much too full with
bad developments.

Dr. M, now safe in Boston, is distraught over M23. HR Defenders fund covered his airfare and rent.

We've been working round the clock to plan evacuation of our PHR staffer whose office is at Panzi and as important --
some of the key judicial people whose lives will be at risk when M23 takes over. Mike Posner was very helpful reaching
US Amb overnight and my colleague should be crossing into Rwanda now                                             They
are very worried about abandoning all the local Colleagues. Goma prison was emptied yesterday - did I tell you this?
Very dangerous if same happens in Bukavu.

I have a full list of supplies needed at HEAL. Would you like it? They are trying to get ICRC to deliver -- or other means.

Will keep you posted. Dr. M very grateful for all the DOS support.
