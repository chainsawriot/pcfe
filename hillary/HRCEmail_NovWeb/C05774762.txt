Great. Dan calling now -- will get download.

            I think it's in train.

Have fun with Hague.

I took a short break from the MEPP to relax ... and edit the QDDR! The executive summary is coming together.

Also, at some point we have to talk about the December review.

These were the topics I was thinking about for tomorrow's POTUS meeting. Am I missing anything on your list?
