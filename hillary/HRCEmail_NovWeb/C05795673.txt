The cycle of poverty in the developing world is an extremely large and complex issue. But our friends at Plan
International believe there is a simple solution.

And it starts with girls.

A girl born into one of the poorest regions of the world is one of the most disadvantaged people on the planet.

Her challenges start in early childhood and, more than likely, she'll become a disadvantaged woman.

But if you give girls access to a good education, it has a profound and proven effect.

With education, a girl in the developing world will have higher self-esteem, gain essential life skills, marry
later, and have healthier children. Her chances of getting AIDS and HIV will be significantly reduced and it is
less likely that she will be affected by sexual harassment or human trafficking.

What's more, she will be able to pass the benefit of her education on to her children and the generation that
follows.

So this year, Omnicom agencies have come together with Plan to help people see the incredible potential of
girls and the transformative effect that an education can have on them.

The campaign is called "Because I Am A Girl." It will launch on the first-ever United Nations-recognized
"International Day of the Girl" on October 11, 2012. On this day, Plan International needs to convince the UN
that educating girls in developing countries must be a priority.

This is where you come in. Our goal is to inspire a global movement starting with asking at least one million
people to "raise their hand" if they believe every girl deserves an education.

All you need to do is click a button at http://www.raiseyourhandnow.com. It won't take but a minute and it will
make a huge difference. Please tap into your personal and social networks and ask them to join us in our
mission to get at least one million hands raised.

On behalf of the dedicated people at Plan International and our Omnicom agencies AMV BBDO, GMR, OMD,
Platinum Rye, and Porter Novelli, thank you for your support.
