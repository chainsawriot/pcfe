Cheryl, I can't imagine what this week has been like for you but wanted to write after attending the Andrews ceremony
today. I was with some NEA hands who knew Chris well and they all noted the Secretary's visit to their offices earlier in
the week and how pitch-perfect this has been handled. The remarks today were beautiful and moving. I did not have a
personal connection to the four lost this week but the President and Secretary seemed to be speaking as well to those I
did know and still mourn. So I wanted to write to say thank you. This is among the most challenging and uncertain
periods in our history -- and our nation is more fortunate than it knows to have such a steady team at the helm.
