FYI below read all traffic.

I revised the position description and sent to her she's fine with it (see below).

I then sent it to Bob who has sent revisions that I have not yet reviewed.

It is really going to be fun working with you. Let me know if I can help sell this to Bob. Spoke to Rose
Gottemuller today and wished her luck on her Thursday confirmation hearing. She's going to be very effective.
Met with Russian Dep ForMin Rybakov today. He came in for a courtesy visit. I made clear that I was a long
way from confirmation but he was very upbeat. He's truly engaged in moving forward. Very animated about
HRC and Lavrov meeting. They really loved "reset".
Thanks and good luck

Cheryl,
Your reinterpretation of Bob's duties as outlined in the 3.24 doe is excellent and maximizes his skill set and
relationships while keeping the responsibilities with the Under Secretary.
Thanks for working this with me. You are really, really good.
Ellen

Ellen

I'm not sure if this will accomplish our goals and whether we should just instead identify it as a general advisor role to
the Secretary and Under secretary so you and she gain the benefit of his technical expertise — which is immense and will
be valuable for various negotiations including START and others.

Take a look and let me know — for our meeting I am just asking him to consider that the role is advisory without being
specific about how to change the position description to create clarity.

My track change version is the second document.
