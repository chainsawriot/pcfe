Thanks for having me along for the Israel stop. Your whole traveling crew is amazing and terrifically good humored at the
end of a grueling trip. Your stamina and focus is understandably now legendary! Appreciate too the US magazine in the
midst of war and peace- a little pop culture gossip is a really good thing. Hope you have a day to regroup. Look forward
to catching up before end of week when talk with my P5+1 colleagues about way forward. Thanks again. Wendy
