AFGHAN PRESIDENT NOMINATES FOUR CABINET MEMBERS
(SBU) An Afghan government spokesman said President Karzai officially nominated Bismullah Khan
Mohammedi as defense minister, Mujtaba Patang as interior minister, Asadullah Khaled as intelligence chief,
and Haji Din Mohammed as border and tribal affairs minister, media report. Embassy Kabul comments
reactions to these nominations have been mixed, and despite rumors to the contrary, no further announcements
regarding a wider cabinet reshuffle have been made. Some of these nominations could face challenges in
parliament during the confirmation process, which could start as early as this week. (Ops/Embassy Kabul e-

TURKISH SECURITY FORCES CLASH WITH KURDISH REBELS
(SBU) At least nine Turkish soldiers and police officers were killed and eight wounded during fighting with
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) militants in Sirnak province, near the southeastern border with Syria and Iraq,
media report. Embassy Ankara comments local media report the PKK fighters entered Turkey from Syria, but
there has been no official Turkish government confirmation of these reports. Turkey has consistently warned
that if the PKK launches an attack on Turkey from Syria, Turkish security forces reserve the right to engage in
                                                                                    -
cross-border operations to eliminate the threat. (Ops/Embassy Ankara telcon and e mail, Reuters)

CHINESE DEFENSE MINISTER VISITS INDIA
(SBU) Minister Liang is the first Chinese defense minister to visit India in eight years, and the trip follows
Chinese military infrastructure build-up along the shared border, media report. Embassy New Delhi comments
Indian officials confided they do not expect any breakthroughs resolving border issues. While Chinese military
expansion and economic influence in the Indian Ocean area unnerves the Indian government, it does not want
conflict with its largest trading partner. Embassy Beijing comments the visit appears to be related in part to
China's concern over instability in Afghanistan and Pakistan. China will not allow its relationship with India to
affect Sino-Pakistani relations, however, because of the importance it places on those ties. (Ops/Embassy New
