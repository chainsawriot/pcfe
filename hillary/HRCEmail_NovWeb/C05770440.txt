FYI. WSJ is pursuing a story that Amb Eikenberry has obstructed CIA station chief from direct contact with Karzai.

P.J.

I checked in with Caitlin Hayden a couple weeks ago on this story, and she said Amb. Eikenberry didn't want to comment.
But my editor wanted to make sure that State had every opportunity to weigh in on what we are reporting, so I wanted to
check with you as well because the story could run as soon as tomorrow.

The story looks at the CIA station chief in Kabul and his relationship with President Karzai. As part of that story, a few
things have come up that I wanted to run past State/Amb. Eikenberry because these are details we are reporting in the
story.


   1) I was told that the Ambassador had opposed the initial candidate for CIA station chief for this latest tour and also
opposed the selection of the person who became station chief. I'm very interested in the reasons for that position, if you
could shed some light on that.
     2) I was told that Amb. Eikenberry had barred CIA station chiefs from direct outreach to President Karzai and that
position was later overruled by President Obama after Karzai's anti-Western comments in April about joining the Taliban,
etc. and he asked that the station chief smooth things out with Karzai. So, I'd appreciate any perspective Amb. Eikenberry
or State can provide on the reasoning behind his position and what his take is on the effect of having the station chief talk
with Karzai.

Sorry for the last-minuteness of the request. We just wanted to check in with headquarters State since Amb. Eikenberry's
spokesperson said he didn't want to comment.

I'll follow up with a phone call shortly, but I wanted to make sure you had these details all in one place, so you could
reference them.

Thank you,
Siobhan
