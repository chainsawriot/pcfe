Subject:                          Thank you



I asked to attend your svtc today with Embassy Tripoli, because I had first met so many of that staff when I went with
you from Malta to Tripoli for the reopening of our Embassy.

Today's deaths hit me much harder than I would have guessed. I am always proud to serve under you, but never have
your words been more meaningful than on today's svtc. Every day of your tenure has been extraordinary, but none
more so than today. Thank you again for your inspirational leadership and example.
As ever,
Harold
