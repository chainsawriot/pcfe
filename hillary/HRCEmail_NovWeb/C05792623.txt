Below FYI. Making my way home now. 3 bombings + Malala shot just while I was there. I could not be more pessimistic
about Pakistan. I do not think S should go back bic of security, alone.

I'll latch up with Lona re S's request for time.

Thanks, Alec. When you're back, let's catch up soon. I'm copying Lona to ask for some time together.

Madam Secretary:
Hello from Islamabad. I had a good sit-down with FM Khar who asked me to directly share her appreciation for your
strong statement regarding Malala Yousafazi.

The clerics have a choice at Friday prayers --- do they speak out against the Taliban and violence against a 14 year-old
girl, or do focus on producing another round of protests against the USA? Important choice.
