The Secretary's Call Sheet for

Joint Special Envoy Kofi Annan

Thursday, August 2, 2012



(C) Purpose of Call: Joint Special Envoy (JSE) Kofi Annan has requested to speak with you. On August 2, UN Secretary-
General Ban announced that Annan has decided not to renew his mandate after it expires August 31.

•     (SBU) Appreciation for Annan's role, Continued Support for U.N.: The United States greatly appreciates your
tireless efforts these past months to find a peaceful solution to the worsening crisis in Syria. Your creativity, your selfless
devotion and your statesmanship have been invaluable to the cause of peace. I also want to thank you for the near
constant contact we have maintained — not to mention the intensive engagement of our respective teams — all of which
has been in the pursuit of our shared goals for a better future for Syrians and the wider region.




•    (SBU) Solicit Annan's Views:




•   (SBU) (IF RAISED) UNSMIS Update: I was concerned to hear about the July 30 attack against a UNSMIS convoy, and
we commend the brave men and women for operating under such danger.




(SBU) Background: Kofi Annan was appointed UN-Arab League Joint Special Envoy February 23. Despite getting initial
agreement from both the Syrian regime and the opposition to adhere to his six-point plan, his efforts stalled as violence
continued to escalate inside Syria. SYG Ban, in a written statement, said he was consulting with the Arab League
Secretary General on the prompt appointment of a successor.
