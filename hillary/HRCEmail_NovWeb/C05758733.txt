Dear Cheryl,




I just spoke to                      who had called me last week         was following up to visit about and confirm his
interest in




Cheryl, I think this is a major development in my opinion and would strongly recommend you and Secretary Clinton
promptly consider                                       I assume Secretary Clinton                and favorably from
                                                                                  have been friends for a good number of
years now




I worked closely          during my time in the White House                                                             is a
unique fellow in some respects, he is a serious and thoughtful person and obviously knows the issues of the hemisphere
in a depthful manner, as you would expect                                  I think he can be particularly constructive on the
                                       and frankly just the overall Latin America agenda.

I don't want to be too strong in my recommendation or involve myself inappropriately in your and the Secretary's
decision making regarding personnel,                        is a person of real accomplishment and has a standing that is
similar to Senator Mitchell, Richard Holbrooke and Dennis Ross. Of course as someone dedicated to hemispheric affairs
I would certainly like to see the Special Envoy to the region be a person of distinction and recognized accomplishment.




Please call me as soon as you can on this one. I think it's quite an important development, as I noted, and would like to
have a brief conversation about it with you and perhaps the Secretary.




As always thank you for your consideration.




Personally,


Mack




PS Secretary Clinton was superb in her interview with George Stephanopoulos, although I must admit I don't remember
conversations in 1993 between the two of them being conducted in the same style or manner. J
