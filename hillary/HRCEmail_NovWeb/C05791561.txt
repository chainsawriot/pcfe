Deputy Secretary Burns, Jake, Alec,

Please keep close hold, but my team is planning to launch a tool on Sunday that will publicly track and map the
defections in Syria and which parts of the government they are coming from. Our logic behind this is that while
many people are tracking the atrocities, nobody is visually representing and mapping the defections, which we
believe are important in encouraging more to defect and giving confidence to the opposition. Given how hard it
is to get information into Syria right now, we are partnering with Al-Jazeera who will take primary ownership
over the tool we have built, track the data, verify it, and broadcast it back into Syria. I've attached a few visuals
that show what the tool will look like. Please keep this very close hold and let me know if there is anything else
you think we need to account for or think about before we launch. We believe this can have an important
impact.

Thanks,
Jared
