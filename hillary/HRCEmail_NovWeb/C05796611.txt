Dear Mrs Verveer,
Under the pressure of the Civil Society & thanks to the support OF the international community , I am pleased
& proud to inform you that the National Constituant Assembly, backed upon the 'complementarity' that was
first described
in artcile 21st draft' s Constitution & now it has replaced it by EQUALITY.
Yes, we can !
Thank you so much for your continuous support to Tunisia.
