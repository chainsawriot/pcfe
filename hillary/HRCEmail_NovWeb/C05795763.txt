Good evening.

First, amazing service today. Many thanks to you and everyone at your Department -- beginning with the Secretary -- for
working so incredibly hard to make such a difficult ceremony so dignified for everyone involved. The Director and I are
truly grateful.

Second, we are now in the process of sending you the classified cables the Secretary and/or you requested. We are
sending them to your Ops Center. Thanks.

Cheers, RS
