           Sorry — I've been flat out. (And I've agreed to have dinner with Anne-Marie at 7!)

                1. Well get you a new CGI draft tomorrow morning for you to noodle on. Feel free to'call when you've looked at it
                    and we can talk about other directions if it doesn't feel right.
                2, Tom met with Barak today; I will get readout from Sam V tomorrow afternoon. Wendy is going to write points
                    for you.
                3. Yousef called to say now that Jeff is gone ABZ has no one to talk to on a regular basis and asked if he could talk
                    to Bill Burns.
                4. Ben Rhodes sent me the draft UNGA speech which I will forward to you shortly.
                5. Bill/Wendy are currently in a SVTC on some information that they may want to report to you on — but unclear
                    whether there is anything to it.
                6. We've nailed down a $15 mm non-lethal support and $15 mm humanitarian support announcement for next
                    Friday's Friends of Syria meeting.
                7. Hold on Rick Olson was lifted by Paul.
                8. Protestors stormed Ansar al Shade's headquarters in Benghazi, and a huge number marched against militias.
                9. 1 saw Dennis Ross today for one of our S/P sessions. I can fill you in on the latest on his effort. Also, he will send
                    you some stuff in advance of your relevant meetings (he was just in Israel).

           That's the key stuff for now. More medium-range stuff to discuss in NY.
