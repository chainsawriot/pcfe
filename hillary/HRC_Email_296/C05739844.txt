             Ni,

             Went down to talk to Eric this evening, but missed him. Sent him note, and will follow up tomorrow. Also had long talk
             with Pat. He's coping, but as you well know it's not easy.

             I like the Greg Starr idea.
                                                                                                                                          B5

             Take care,

             Bill
