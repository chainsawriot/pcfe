             S Specials, Hume — I'd be grateful if you could pass this to $, for her information. Thank you.
             -- Jeff

             Madam Secretary: I want to let you know about a temporary rotation in Benghazi. TNC Envoy Chris Stevens has been
             on the road since March 13, when he began his outreach mission, and has been in Benghazi since April 5.                         B6

                                           discussed this with Bill Bums today. Bill and I support this request and look forward to
             the opportunity to discuss with Chris the way forward with the INC.

             I know how important it is to have continual coverage (security conditions permitting) in Benghazi. I will send Embassy
             Tripoli's DCM Joan Polaschik to serve as Acting Envoy during Chris' absence. Like Chris, she knows many of the TNC
             leaders from her time in Tripoli. Since her return to Washington, she's been working with Gene and NEA on Libya
             policy and also been coordinating many of the support issues for the team in Benghazi.




             Cheers,
             Jeff
