          Re: France & UK behind Libya breakup

          SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of
          European Governments, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, and Western Intelligence and security services

                   1. During the period between mid-January 2012 to March 2012 officers of the a French General Directorate for
          External Security ( Direction Generale de la Securite Exterieure Dcsp, and the British Secret Intelligence Service
          (SISâ€”Ml-8) activated longstanding contacts with tribal and civic leaders in Eastern Libya, in an effort to encourage them
          to establish a semi-autonomous zone in the historic province of Cyrenaica (Barge in Arabic). According to extremely
          knowledgeable sources, this effort was initiated by advisors to French President Nicholas Sarkozy after complaints from
          concerned French business leaders that the new Libyan Government was not rewarding appropriately French firms for the
          leading role France played in supporting the 2011 revolution against former Dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. SIS joined in
          this effort at the instruction of the office of Prime Minister David Cameron. This highly confidential effort comes in
          response to the inability of the National Transitional Council (NTC) government in Tripoli to organize the country
          effectively and deal with Western business interests in an effective and efficient manner.
                   2. The French and British business and intelligence officials believe that a semi-autonomous regime in the
          Eastern city of Benghazi will be able to organize business opportunities in that region. This in turn will allow these
          Western firms to initiate new business projects. These same officials believe that there is also reduced threat from
          Islamist militias in the East. According to a knowledgeable source, French officials believe that this situation is the natural
          result of el-Keib's failure to organize the country and disarm the ethnic and regional militias who did the majority of the
          fighting against Qaddafi's forces during the revolution.

                   3. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, the French Government and business leaders
          actually expected to receive thirty five (35) per cent of new economic development in Libya after the fall of Qaddafi. Like
          many Western businessmen, these French officials made informal agreements with former Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril
          and his advisors, only to see these agreements ignored or delayed when Abdurrahim el-Keib became head of government
          in October 2011. In their opinion, once el-Keib moved the government from the Eastern city of Benghazi to the national
          capital at Tripoli, the government became inefficient and inaccessible. These individuals also believe that the

           appointment of Minister of Oil Abduirahman Ben Yezza, who was a long time official of the Italian oil Company (EN!), was
           a factor. According to these sources, the bulk of ENI's oil fields are in the Western part of Libya, and Ben Yezza focused
           his attentions on that region, while failing to effectively organize new business East of Benghazi. These same officials
          state that the influences of the Western militias, particularly those from the Zintan region, have weakened the influence of
          the Eastern Elders.)
                    4. An extremely sensitive source stated that the DGSE and SIS intend to control the move toward a semi-
          autonomous state under a federal system, However, they have been surprised by el-Keites intention, expressed both in
          public and in secret meetings with Minister of Defense Ousama al JUWali, a native of Zintan, to use force to hold the
          country together. El-Keth is also committed to Ben Yezza, although he is frustrated by the chaotic situation in Tripoli. This
          atmosphere affects new business for the most part and has been extremely irritating for businessmen from France and
          other Western countries.

          while these Western officials are focused on working around the chaotic business situation, they are risking a civil war,
          failing to reci !nized the longstanding and complicated relationship between the Eastern and Western parts of the country.
          Qaddafi, as an absolute dictator, suppressed these differences, which have reemerged with his defeat and death. In
          addition, el-Keib is talking to old acquaintances in the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, in an effort to apply their influence to
          the Eastern tribal Eiders, and help hold the country together.)
