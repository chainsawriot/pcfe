            SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
            highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.


                  1. During mid-October 2012 Libyan President Yu.ssef el Magariaf stated in private that he and
           Prime Minister Ali Zidan have ordered National Libyan Army (NLA) Chief of Staff General Youssef al
           Mangoush to establish a more coordinated operational relationship with Misrata and Zintan militias
           in order to support expanded army operations throughout the country. According to a sensitive
           source, prior to the death of the United States Ambassador on September 11, 2012 Mangoush resisted
           greater reliance on these specific large militias, believing that such a move undercuts the
           government's efforts to disarm and demobilize all of the militias left over from the 2011 civil war. At
           this point, however, Mangoush agreed with Magariaf that the situation in the country is becoming

               increasingly dangerous and unmanageable. Accordingly, the Chief of Staff stated that he will work
               with Ousama al Jouwali, the leader of the Zintan forces to step up operations against the other
               militias, (supported by the Misrata troops), that also come from the mountainous region of Western
               Libya. At the same time he will instruct NLA troops under ground force commander General Khalifa
               Belqasim Haftar to pursue operations against tribal forces fighting on behalf of the Qaddafi family in
               Southern and Southeastern Libya.
                       2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Magariaf and Zidan agree that Libya's
               future depends on the success of their efforts in this militia demobilization operation over the next six
               months. While they believe that the involvement of Ansar al Sharia forces, with the assistance of al
               Qati. cla in the Islamic Magreb (AQIM), in the assassination of the U.S, Ambassador has focused the
               world business and diplomatic community on the reality of the security issues surrounding the
               militias, the President and Prime Minister also fear that the situation is far worse than Western
               sources realize. Mangoush informs them that AQIM and radical Salafist groups are increasing their
               efforts to take advantage of the frustrations of the various militias with the government, using the
               attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi as an inspiration for their activities. Just as Amax al Sharia
               began as a militia supporting the federalist claims of Eastern tribal leaders, and was then infiltrated
               by AQIM radicals, Mangoush believes many of the other regional and ethnic militias around the
               country could follow the same path, if his troops do not succeed in the disarmament program. He
               also agrees with Zidan that they must move quickly since Libya's tradition of avoiding the Sunni-Shia
               conflict that dominates most of Middle East is beginning to erode during this period of chaos.)

                      3. A particularly sensitive source noted that NLA operations have already begun against Ansar
               al Sharia forces south of Benghazi, after members of that militia/terrorist group killed four national
               policemen during a grenade attack at a roadblock in the Sousa Mountains. Under orders from Haftar
               Libyan troops surrounded more than 100 Ansar al Sharia fighters in the region of the town of Sousa.
               According to this sensitive source, the NLA suffered relatively heavy casualties in the fighting, but
               believe they captured a number of AQIM operatives and one of Ansar al Sharia's senior commanders,
               Sufian bin Qamu, who they believe ordered the attack on the police. Mangoush also reported to Zidan
               that Qamu had been previously captured by United States forces and imprisoned at the Guantanamo
               Bay facility.

                     4. At the same time the Libyan army and forces from the Misrata militia entered the town of
              Rani Walid approximately 100 miles south of Tripoli, in an area still loyal to the Qaddafi family,
              engaging in close fighting with pro-Qaddafi forces. During the fighting Haftar dispatched troops with
              heavier arms to support the Misrata forces. According to this source, the NLA downplayed the level of
              the fighting, in an effort to reassure the supporters of the Government. That said the NLA/Misrata
              force had captured the city center and the airport after suffering significant casualties. The
              Government forces entered the city after shelling opposition positions around the city hospital, using
              heavy mortars and motorized guns.

                     5. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this knowledgeable individual, while Magariaf and
              Zidan remain optimistic about the future of Libya, they believe that the security situation will remain
              tenuous throughout 2013. Magariaf also sees the national election scheduled for mid-2013 as a
              potentially complicating factor. According to this source, Mangoush and Haftar focused on Bani
              Walid under pressure from the Misrata commanders. These militia leaders were, according to a
              knowledgeable source, angered over the death of one of their senior officials, Oman Shahan, at the
              hands of pro-Qaddafi forces in Bani Walid. The Misrata commanders report that Shaban was one of
              the organizers of the Misrata militia unit that captured and executed Qaddafi in 2011 outside of the
              town of Sirte, The Misrata leaders, supported by the General National Council (CNC), demanded the
              surrender of the men who arrested and killed Shahan. As the fighting expanded through late
              September and early October, Magariaf and his advisors came to see Bani Walid as an important
