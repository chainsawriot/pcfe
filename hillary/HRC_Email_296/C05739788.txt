              Cheryl, I can't imagine what this week has been like for you but wanted to write after attending the Andrews ceremony
              today. I was with some NEA hands who knew Chris well and they all noted the Secretary's visit to their offices earlier in
              the week and how pitch-perfect this has been handled. The remarks today were beautiful and moving. I did not have a
              personal connection to the four lost this week but the President and Secretary seemed to be speaking as well to those I
              did know and still mourn. So I wanted to write to say thank you. This is among the most challenging and uncertain
              periods in our history â€” and our nation is more fortunate than it knows to have such a steady team at the helm,
              Brett
