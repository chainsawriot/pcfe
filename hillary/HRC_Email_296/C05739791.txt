             Cheryl, Please extend our thanks to the Secretary for today's moving event. As always, her remarks (the President's and
             the chaplain's) were just right. I will also send a note to Pat and Capricia to thank them for a well led day that helped
             build solidarity, despite the sorrow.

             Thanks also for Cindy and Yael they are a pleasure to work with every day.

             We are making real progress.

             Best, Rick
