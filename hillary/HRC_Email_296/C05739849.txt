              Dear Bill and Tom,

             I'm sorry that I cannot be on the Hill today as we had long planned, but very grateful that you both will be. The
             Department and I appreciate your leadership everyday.

             So, I'll be nursing my cracked head and cheering you on as you "remain calm and carry on"!

             Happy Holidays--H
