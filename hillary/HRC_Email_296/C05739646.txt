            EXCLUSIVE: Bill Clinton Says He Wouldn't Rule Out Arming
            Libya's Rebels
             Pm Just Speaking For Myself, Former President Says

            By SUZAN CLARICE

            April 3, 2011 —

            Former U.S. President Bill Clinton said he thinks the United States should consider arming the rebels in Libya's
            civil war.

            "It would depend ... and I might need to know a little more, but I would be inclined to do it," Clinton told
            correspondent Bianna Golodryga today in San Diego during an exclusive interview with ABC News.

            Clinton was in San Diego for his annual Clinton Global Initiative University Meeting.

            The uprising in Libya stared in February during a wave of social and political unrest in the Middle East.
            Fighting has escalated all across the country, but the rebels have found themselves outgunned by Libyan leader
            Col. Moamrnar Gadhafi's forces, which are better equipped.

             Last month the United Nations authorized a no-fly zone over the North African nation to prevent further attacks
             on civilians from Gadhafiss troops in the air.

             Clinton on Arming Rebels: 'I Sure Wouldn't Shut the Door to It'

             The United States backed the no-fly zone and has also authorized additional support for the anti-Gad hafi
             fighters, but key U.S. lawmakers and top officials in the government of President Barack Obanaa have said they
             are not comfortable with arming the rebels -- apparently because not enough is known about then

             But Clinton said he wouldn't completely rule out the idea of supplying arms to Libya's rebels.

             "Let me just say this. I sure wouldn't shut the door to it. I think ... we may need to know a little more," he said.

             Clinton, husband of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, stressed that he was speaking without "any official
             sanction" whatsoever.

             "I'm just speaking from myself. But I certainly wouldn't take that off the table, too," he said.
