               Subject: Video shows Libyans helping rescue US ambassador after attack (Reuters)

               BENGHAZI (Reuters) - An amateur video appears to show Libyans trying to rescue U.S. ambassador
               Christopher Stevens from a room filled with smoke at the U.S. mission where he was found unconscious after
               last week's attack by a mob protesting against a film that denigrates the Prophet Mohammad.

                 The video,, which appeared on the interne and a copy of which was obtained by Reuters in Benghazi,
              confirms reports that suggested the U.S. envoy died of asphyxiation after the building caught fire.

                  The footage also sheds new light on the circumstances of the ambassador's death, apparently showing for the
              first time that some of the people who forced their way into the U.S. compound later tried to rescue Stevens
              after they found him lying alone, with no security detail, in one of the rooms in the building.

                 The video shows a group of young men who had earlier stormed the compound telling other protesters by the
              light of torches and mobile phones that they had found someone who appeared to be a foreigner lying on the
              floor.

                 "There is someone inside He is a foreigner, he is a foreigner. Take him out," said one man, shouting for
              help.

                  "Bring him out, man! Bring him out," another said.

                  "The man is alive. Bring him out, man. Bring him out," said a third.

                  "Alive, Alive! God is Greatest," the crowd cried. Someone called for a car.

                 "Make space, is there someone who is a medic around? Anyone who can get a car quickly?" another man can
              be heard saying.

                 Stevens and three other embassy staff died when gunmen attacked the U.S. consulate and a safe house in the
              eastern Libyan city on Tuesday night. The attackers were part of a crowd blaming America for a film they said
              insulted the Prophet Mohammad.

                 Security personnel were separated from Stevens during the attack, U.S. officials said, in the chaos of smoke
              and gunfire that ensued.

                The identity and motive of the attackers remain unclear. Activists who took part in the protest said the
              motive was rage at the video produced in California and which describes the Prophet as a homosexual and

             womaniser.

                Some Libyan officials blamed the attack on radical Islamist groups linked to al Qaeda, such as regional
            affiliate Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and Ansar al-Sharia. Both groups back the introduction of Islamic
            Sharia law rather than democracy.

              The footage shows Stevens lying on the floor in a smoke-filled room after protesters had stormed the
            compound and set fire to its buildings.

               Minutes later he was pulled out of the room through a window, and then placed on the courtyard's stone tile
            floor. A young man is seen putting his hand on his neck to check if he was breathing.

               A protester wearing a white T-shirt who had carried Stevens out of the room was hugged by a fellow
            protestor in a traditional expression of gratitude.

               Seconds after the protesters found Stevens was alive, a young man in the background can be heard shouting:
            "Take him to my car, bring him to my car."

               A doctor on duty in the emergency room at the Benghazi Medical Centre that night has said local civilians
            brought in the ambassador at around 1 a.m. While the doctor performed CPR for 45 minutes, Stevens died of
            asphyxiation due to smoke inhalation. His body was later returned to U.S. custody.
