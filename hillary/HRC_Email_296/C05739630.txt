              As is common practice for this and all Administrations, I am not going to comment on intelligence matters I
              will reiterate what the President said yesterday - no decision has been made about providing arms to the
              opposition or to any group in Libya. We're not ruling it out or ruling it in. We're assessing and reviewing
              options for all types of assistance that we could provide to the Libyan people, and have consulted directly with
              the opposition and our international partners about these matters.
