             Subject                          Thank you



             I asked to attend your svtc today with Embassy Tripoli, because had first met so many of that staff when I went with
             you from Malta to Tripoli for the reopening of our Embassy.

             Today's deaths hit me much harder than I would have guessed. I am always proud to serve under you, but never have
             your words been more meaningful than on today's svtc. Every day of your tenure has been extraordinary, but none
             more so than today. Thank you again for your inspirational leadership and example.
             As ever,
             Harold
