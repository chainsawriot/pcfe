           Re: Syria aiding Qaddafi


           This memo has two parts. Part one is the report that Syria is providing air support for Qaddafi. Part two is a note
           to Cody from Lord David Owen, former UK foreign secretary on his views of an increasingly complex crisis. It
           seems that the situation is developing into a protracted civil war with various nations backing opposing sides
           with unforeseen consequences. Under these circumstances the crucial challenge is to deprive Qaddafi of his
           strategic depthâ€”his support both financial and military.


             I.      Report
           During the afternoon of March 3, advisers to Muammar Qaddafi stated privately that the Libyan
          Leader has decided that civil war is inevitable, pitting troops and mercenary troops loyal to him
          against the rebel forces gathering around Benghazi. Qaddafi is convinced that these rebels are
          being supported by the United States, Western Europe and Israel. On March 2 Qaddafi told his
          son Saif al-Islam that he believes the intelligence services of the United States, Great Britain,

         Egypt, and France have deployed paramilitary officers to Benghazi to assist in organizing,
         _raining, and equipping opposition forces. Qaddafi is convinced that the National Libyan Council
         :NLC), and its leader, former Minister of Justice Mustafa Mohamed Abdel Gall have been
         :thosen by the foreign powers to replace him. On March 1 advisors to Qaddafi stated that
         Q,addafi's cousin, Col. Al Qaddafiddam had failed in efforts to recruit fighters among the
         Egyptian population living immediately across the border with Libya.

         These individuals added that during the week of February 21 the Libyan Leader spoke to Syrian
         president Bashir al-Assad on at least three occasions by secure telephone lines. During the
         :,onversations Qaddafi asked that Syrian officers and technicians currently training the Libyan
         /kir Force be placed under command of the Libyan Army and allowed to fight against the rebel
         tbrces.

         (Source Comment: Senior Libyan Army officers still loyal to Qaddafi added that On February
         23, President Assad told General Isam HaIlaq, the commander in chief of the Syrian Air Force,
        :o instruct the pilots and technicians in Tripoli to help the Libyan regime, should full scale Civil
         War breaks out in the immediate future.)

         On March 2, a military officer with ties to Qaddfi's son Khamis stated privately that the number
        Df Libyan pilots defecting to the opposition has destroyed the morale and professional spirit of
        ,he Libyan Air Force at this critical moment, when Tripoli's air superiority is its principal weapon
        against insurgents. In the opinion of this individual Qaddafi and his senior military advisors are
        convinced that the European Union and the U.S will impose a no-fly zone over Libya in the
        immediate future. These advisors believe that the no fly zone will serve as air support for
        Dpposition forces. They are also prepared for the Western allies to bomb anti-aircraft facilities in
        and around Tripoli in preparation for the establishment of the no-fly zone. Foreign Minister
        Mousa Kousa is convinced that that Russia and Turkey will oppose the move, and may prevent
        the implementation of the no fly zone.

        The Syrian soldiers in Libya are part of a mission established in 1984 following the signing of a
        military agreement between Qaddafi and Syria's long-time ruler and Bashir's father, Hafez al-

       Force at the time. Both Air Forces are equipped with Russian materiel and have had long-
       ;tanding, close links with Moscow.

           From: Lord Owen


           Cody,

           Realistically the UN will not authorise a no fly zone while Gaddafi continues to hold off bombing and
           strafing but keeping it up front and on the military agenda keeps him worried. Yet for a few frustrating months
           that ambivalence kept the Serbian aeroplanes on the ground before we acted. My hope is that preparations
           continue with visuals of planes flying off carriers, airborne early warning planes flying and people with clout
           outside the Administration demanding preparations. But and it is a big BUT what else can and should we be
           doing? Encourage humanitarian ships and convoys from Egypt to bring in supplies since we must ensure the
           cities in the East can hold up living standards, maybe for months. More adventurous, Egyptian Special Forces to
           go in and advise, even supplying hand held missiles. It appears they have few missiles; the military in the East
           having been deliberately kept ill-equipped. There is old Nasserite sentiment for a Federation of Egypt, Sudan
           and Libya. I know some will say Egypt has enough problems and they should stay resolutely focused on
           domestic reforms. it is delicate but words alone and the balance of advantage will slip to Gaddafi. A Gaddafi
