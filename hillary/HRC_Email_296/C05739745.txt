          Subject: FW: Benghazi update (1200 local)

          Update from Rep. Stevens in Benghazi, based on largely on info from acting PM Ali Tarhouni and acting FM
          Salah Bishari:


               •   TNC caretaker cabinet/members were up until 4am following events in Tripoli and discussing plans for
                   the coming days. Tarhouni said the TNC has been in constant communication with its people in Tripoli,
                   including both fighters and those entrusted with implementing the stabilization plans. Rebels in Tripoli,
                   in coordination with the TNC, have begun to set up checkpoints inside the city and guard public
                   buildings.
               •   TNC chairman Abd al Jalil and PM Jibril made statements to the media last nigh urging people to
                   refrain from revenge attacks and destruction of public buildings.
               • There has so far been "no bloodbath" or serious looting.
               •   The capture of Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi and Mohamed al-Qadhafi is significant. The TNC, including
                   Abd al-Jalil himself, intervened with rebels surrounding Mohamed's house to ensure that they did not
                   harm him. They understood that it would be harmful to the revolution and the TNC if he were
                   killed. These events were captured live by Al Jazeera in interviews with Mohamed. Both brothers are
                   in rebel custody (at this time, it is unclear to us exactly who is holding them, however).
               • Per Tarhouni, the next steps are: 1) find Muammar Qadhafi; 2) issue a statement announcing the end of
                 the Qadhafi regime and the start of the interim period under the mic (TNC staff have begun drafting
                 this statement already); 3) insure the delivery of essential services and commodities (esp addressing the
                 acute shortages of fuel, children's milk, and medication for blood pressure and diabetes); and 4) move
                 the TNC to Tripoli.
               •   Regarding the move to Tripoli, Tarhouni said security arrangements would need to be made before they
                   could send the TNC leadership to the capital. We have heard from another contact that some TNC
                   members are already making plans to fly to Misurata and the Western Mountains, possibly as early as
                   today, and from there drive to Tripoli.
