               FYI —Jeff and I discussed and I fully agree that a NATO liaison is a good idea.

              Ivo, thanks for the helpful response. From NEA's perspective, an operational liaison with the TNC does
              not constitute formal, legal recognition of the INC as the government of Libya. We don't consider
              Chris Stevens' presence in Benghazi to trigger formal recognition, and we've never broken relations
              with Libya despite suspending our embassy operations.

              Without question, having a NATO liaison in Benghazi would have the appearance of NATO leaning in
              the direction of the INC. But NATO's operations already show a considerable lean away from
              Qadhati. Speaking for NEA, I don't mind the appearance. But the real purpose would be to avoid
              friendly fire incidents, of course.

              Cheers,
              Jeff

              Jeff -

              Been in touch with ADMs Stavridis and Locklear. They are working the issue hard, thru both US and UK channels, to
              solidify liaison cells with the rebels, The diversity of the opposition makes setting up the contacts more difficult, but the
              Nato command is fully engaged in trying to set up the right structure to ensure closest possible coordination between
              Naples and the TNC.

              Relatedly, FR and UK are pushing the idea of sending a Nato liaison to the TNC to work the PA angle as well as to
              provide a way to improve communications between INC and Nato HQ on the bigger picture. Sounds sensible, the we
              need to avoid sense that Nato is recognizing TNC or wants role in any political process. Would welcome your thoughts on

              Subject: Benghazi and NATO

              Ivo et al: Greetings. Please look at points #3 and #4 below, conveyed by DCM Polaschik from
              Embassy Tripoli, in exile on Navy Hill) from Chris Stevens, our envoy in Benghazi. This gets at a problem
              that S raised with Jake Sullivan and me: coordination between the Libyan INC and NATO. S
              expressed deep frustration that there doesn't seem to be an existing, working mechanism for
              communication between the INC and NATO (thus leading to mistakes such as attacks on INC
              tanks). She asked us to find a way to fix this, now.

              The question for you and your colleagues, Ivo, is what would work quickly? Should we rely on the UK
              military advisors to do this, as suggested in point 3? Or should we be encouraging the quick
              formation of a NATO cell, as suggested in para 4 ( but which at least RADM Foggo suspected might
              not work)? Are there other ideas? (Joan, does Chris have views, from his on-the-ground-in--Benghazi
              perspective?)

              We obviously need a quick, real solution to avoid more friendly fire incidents.

              Subject: Stevens Update - April 8 at 1200

              SWO — could you please pass this to 7th floor principals/staff? DS also needs to see this update

                  1) Security situation in Benghazi remains quiet. Chris Stevens & team are in the hotel, moving only for meetings as
                     required.

                  2) Chris spoke to the RADM Foggo, Deputy Commander of the 6th Fleet, who confirmed that the 6th fleet would be
                     responsible for the team's evacuation if needed.

                  3) RADM Foggo was very interested in Chris' meeting with TNC Military Coordinator Abdul Fatah Yunis, particularly
                     Yunis' frustration with the lack of coordination with NATO. Foggo is hopeful that presence of UK military
                       advisors on the ground in Benghazi will help improve this coordination. According to Fogo„ DOD is looking at
                       ways to improve communications with the INC, while still being mindful of red line re "boots on the ground."

                   4) Separately, Chris has heard from the UK Envoy that the UK and France are recommending that NATO place a
                       coordination cell with the TNC in order to improve coordination, reduce chances of friendly fire incidents,
                       etc. UK and France believe that existing coordination on a national level (which according to Chris also includes
                       the Italians) is not working well. When Chris briefed this to RADM Foggo, Foggo expressed concern that NATO
                       would not be able to reach agreement on establishment of this kind of coordination cell.
