                                                              WASHINGTON

           Dear Colleagues â€”

           I wanted to reach out to you directly after this challenging week, and express my gratitude for everything you
           do to advance our nation's interests and values. That is how we keep faith with those we serve and honor
           those we've lost. Even after four years, I continue to be amazed by your dedication, energy, and talent. It is a
           privilege to be part of your team.

           I also want to thank everyone who is working so hard to provide all our people and posts with the best
           possible leadership, security and support. As Deputy Secretaries Burns and Nides told Congress on Thursday,
           our colleagues in Diplomatic Security, Near Eastern Affairs, and in every bureau across the Department, at
           home and abroad, get it right countless times a day, for years on end, in some of the toughest circumstances
           imaginable. We need to learn from the tragedy in Benghazi, and make every possible improvement -- and we
           will. We also need to recognize the extraordinary service of our security professionals. They are courageous
           patriots and consummate professionals. And like you, I trust them with my life.

           I want to thank Ambassador Pickering, Admiral Mullen, and all the members of the Accountability Review
           Board. Their report takes a clear-eyed look at serious and systemic problems that we are already working to
           fix. I have accepted every one of the Board's recommendations. I asked the Deputy Secretary for
           Management and Resources to spearhead the effort to implement them, and to take those additional steps
           above and beyond those recommendations that make sense and make us stronger. To do this well, we need
           your help. All of us have to work together to take these reforms to heart and build on and improve the way
           we do business.

           I am determined to leave the State Department and USAID stronger, safer, and more secure than I found
           them. I owe that to each of you. And I am delighted that President Obama has chosen Senator John Kerry to
           continue that work. Earlier today, I spoke with John and congratulated him on his nomination to be the next
           Secretary of State. I have been privileged to know him for many years, and to call him a friend, colleague, and
           partner. He is the son of a career Foreign Service Officer, a decorated war hero, and an accomplished
           statesman. I know that he shares our deep commitment to diplomacy and development. You deserve the
           highest caliber leadership, and that is exactly what you'll get with Senator Kerry.

            It has been one of the great honors of my life to serve with you over the past four years. We have a lot more
            to do together in the coming days and weeks. So I hope you have a wonderful holiday and a joyous new year

            Sincerely,

            Hillary Rodham Clinton
