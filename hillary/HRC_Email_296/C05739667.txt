             Yes, just confirmed that Dan will come at 9arri tomorrow.

             Ops can pick up the pouch in about 30 minutes, Does that work for you? Secret Service can grab it from the bench if
             you'd like.

             Checking now. He left a pouch at your residence of the items you can keep.

             You'll notice on the schedule in your pouch from the office, that the Somali president is listed at 2:45. We are hoping to
             move that to 3pm in case Day goes long. Is that OK with you?

             I just woke up so I missed Dan. Could he come back after I finish my calls? But I don't have the call schedule yet so I don't
             know when that would be. Do you?
