          Here's what fox has up now:

          Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will testify before Congress on the September 11 terror attacks on the US
          consulate in Benghazi, Libya, Fox News has learned. The testimony will be open and will happen in December.

          At a hearing on Capitol Hill today, Foreign Affairs Committee Chairwoman Beam. Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL) told
          the committee that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would be testifying before them in early December.

          "I would like to note that I have spoken to Secretary Clinton's Counselor and Chief of Staff, Cheryl Mills, and
          the Secretary has committed to testifying before our Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on
          the Accountability Review Board's report, which is expected to be concluded by early to mid-December," she
          said.

          Yes

          I spoke with Rep Ros-Lehtinen yesterday.

          Advised that S is committed to speaking to her committees of jurisdiction once the arb is completed.

          And the target date for completion of the Arb was in December.

          Tell me what you need so I can help you with any points.
