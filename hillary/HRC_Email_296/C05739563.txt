                    SUBJECT: Libya (37)
                    SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional
                   Council, as well as the highest levels of European Governments, and Western
                   Intelligence and security services.



                   THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION COMES FROM AN EXTREMELY
                   SENSITIVE SOURCE AND SHOULD BE HANDLED WITH CARE.


                           1. On September 12, 2012 Libyan President Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf
                   told senior advisors that the death of the U.S. Ambassador at the hands of Islamist
                   militia forces represents a threat to the future of the newly elected General National
                   Congress (GNC) Government. According to a sensitive source, el Magariaf
                   believes that the primary goal of this and other attacks on Western facilities is to
                   demonstrate that the GNC cannot protect its non-Islamic friends. Libyan security
                   officials believe that the attack was carried out by forces of the Islamist militia
                   group calling itself the Ansar al Sharia brigade; working out of camps in the
                   Eastern suburbs of Benghazi. These officials added that their sources indicate that
                   this group is led by former members of the old Libyan Islamic Fighting Group
                   (LIFG), some of whom are loyal to Islamist General Abdelhakim Belhaj. The
                   same officials were quick to point out that they have no evidence that Belhaj had
                   any direct involvement in this attack. They also have no direct information as to
                   whether this assault has anything to do with the death of Libyan born al Qai'da
                   leader Abu Yahya al- Libi, but they are pursuing this theme. These officials do

                           believe that the attackers having prepared to launch their assault took advantage of
                           the cover provided by the demonstrations in Benghazi protesting an intemet
                           production seen as disrespectful to the prophet Mohammed.


                                 2. According to this source, the immediate events were set in motion by a
                           statement made by a Muslim Cleric in Egypt saying that the internet film was
                           going to be shown across the United States on September 11 in an effort to insult
                           Muslims on the anniversary of the attacks on the New York World Trade Center in
                           2001. This statement inspired increasingly hostile demonstrations at the U.S.
                           Embassy in Cairo, and at diplomatic facilities in Libya. In Benghazi, reporting
                           from security sources states, approximately twenty one (21) Ansar al Sharia
                           fighters left their base in East Benghazi just after sundown infiltrated the crowd of
                           about 2,000 demonstrators at the U.S. Consulate. These forces, operating under
                           cover of darkness, opened fire on the consulate, eventually setting it on fire with
                           rocket propelled grenades. These fighters then withdrew to their camp. El
                           Magariaf ordered security officials to identify and arrest the attackers, adding that
                           he had been in touch with Egyptian President Mohm_med Morsi, and the two
                           agreed that their intelligence and security personnel will cooperate in this matter.
                           (Note: Some of the Libyan officials believe that the entire demonstration was
                           organized as cover for the attack, however; they point out that there is no evidence
                           of such a complex operation at this time.


                                 3. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Libyan security
                           officers also informed el Magariaf that the attacks had been planned for
                           approximately one month, based on casing information obtained during an early
                           demonstration at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. The attackers were, in the
                           opinion of these individuals, looking for an opportunity to approach the consulate

                    under cover in a crowd. These officials add that government security officers
                    admitted to el Magariaf that they do not have the physical capacity to locate,
                    attack, and destroy the Ansar al-Sharia brigade, among others. They describe these
                    forces as well-trained, hardened killers; many of whom have spent time in
                    Afghanistan and Yemen. These fighters are located in camps in Eastern Libya; and
                    Libyan officials doubt they can penetrate these camps because the militia's are
                   better armed than the forces of the new National Army.


                           4. In the opinion of a separate source El Magariaf continues to believe that
                   the attacks were planned and carried out in a political atmosphere where a portion
                   of the Libyan population is focused on past cooperation between Western
                   intelligence and security services, and the regime of former dictator Muammar al
                   Qaddafi. According to this source, el Magariaf realizes that the death of the U.S.
                   Ambassador dictates that he must find tangible solutions to the problems tied to
                   disarming the militias, dealing Salafist violence against the followers of Sufi
                   beliefs, and efforts to discredit his government through linking him to Western
                   intelligence services. El Magariaf instructed his security officials to cooperate
                   with their U.S. counterparts. He also warned all of his advisors to be prepared for
                   U.S. retaliation against the suspected perpetrators of this attack, and the angry
                   public reaction that is sure to follow.


                           5. (Source Comment: A separate, particularly sensitive source added that in
                   private conversation el Magariaf stated that if his government cannot protect a
                   senior diplomatic official, foreign businesses will not be willing to risk opening up
                   new operations in Libya. According to this sensitive source, el Magariaf believes
                   that a number of the Islamist militias are now being influenced al Qai'da and other
                   radical groups; working out of camps in the Eastern and Southeastern parts of the

                           In the end, el Magariaf added that while he does not expect U.S. officials to focus
                           on this point, he believes the attacks against the interests and citizens of the U.S.
                           and other Western states are aimed first at overthrowing his government, and
                           replacing it with a strict Islamic Republic dominated by Salafist leaders. Magariaf
                           also warned that tribal militias loyal to the Qaddaft family continue to present an
                           equally dangerous threat to the new Government.)
