            Subject: Stevens update

                  Security: Today's focus is on the security situation in Benghazi. There is new local reporting that hotels are being
            targeted. The INC conducted a raid on a house/storage facility and found and arrested an Egyptian cell reportedly there
            for the purpose of attacking hotels. It is believed they were connected to the cell arrested last week, and that
            Interrogation of those arrested earlier led to this round of arrests. Ahmed Qadafadarn, cousin of Qadhafi who was
            envoy to Egypt (and was rumored to have defected), is purportedly the funder and organizer of this cell.

                  CA updated its travel guidance to tell travelers to stay away from the Fadihi Hotel. Stevens will inform the INC this
            afternoon. [NOTE: for your reference, I appended the new WM at the end of this email.]

                  Stevens will be meeting with MFA in one hour and will make a written request for better security at the hotel and
            for better security-related coordination. He still feels comfortable in the hotel. They are looking into the idea of moving
            into a villa, but that is some way off. Need to consider resource requirements (would need TDY'er with authority to sign
            lease, hire local guards, etc.). Based on discussion with DS yesterday, the hotel remains the safest location. Stevens will
            continue to work to have the TNC post more people outside and beef up security presence. They have a good set back
            and are way off the ground.

                  Flights: Stevens checked with head of the airport. There are no regular humanitarian or other flights, however,
            there are flights coming in and the airport could support an air bridge if any country wanted to sat one up. Stevens will
            see his European counterparts this afternoon and will ask how they are bringing in their people and whether we can be
            part of it.

            -      Trip to Rome: Stevens doesn't know yet if Jai is going to Rome. As of now, he's inclined not to go but he might
            change his mind. If the Department thinks he ought to go, Stevens can pass that message. As it stands now Mahmoud
            Jabril and All Tarhouni will be going.

                  Misrata: Stevens spoke with Brig. Gen. Hassi re Misrata. The general was pretty dear that the ostensible move by
            Qadhafi forces out of the area is a ruse. They are withdrawing troops so they won't be hit by NATO, but will send them
            back in in civilian clothing so they can continue killing that way. Hassi said the assertion Qadhafi would leave to the
            tribes to resolve was ridiculous because there are no armed tribes around.
