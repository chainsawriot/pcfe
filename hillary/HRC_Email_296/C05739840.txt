            Make Up Turned Break Up
            By MAUREEN DOWD


            WASHINGTON

            Are the Republican senators unreasonable? Or is the secretary of state-manqué undiplomatic? Did the senators
            sandbag Susan Rice? Or did Rice further inflame a tense situation? Is it a case of shooting the messenger and
            playing politics? Or is national security dangerously infected with politics?

            It seems as if it would have been simple enough for Rice to quickly admit that the administration talking points
            she used on the Sept. 16 Sunday shows about the slaughter in Benghazi were misleading. But she went silent.
            She has no wartime consigliere and, aside from the president's angry postelection defense of Rice, the White
            House — perhaps relieved that she 1- 4,as taking the heat rather than the president — wasn't running a strong
            damage control operation that clarified matters.

            Still, on last Sunday's talk shows, John McCain and Lindsey Graham softened their tone a bit. "She's not the
            problem," McCain said The problem is the president of the United States," for failing to swiftly tell
            Americans what his intelligence agencies had confirmed: that Benghazi was a terrorist attack involving Al
            Qa.eda. affiliates.

            When Rice asked to come to the Hill to meet with some of her Republican critics, it seemed détente was nigh.
            But somehow the hour-and-a-half powwow caused an escalation, with McCain, Graham and Senator Kelly
            Ayotte of New Hampshire emerging to say they had more reservations than before. Senator Bob Corker of
            Tennessee, who's scheduled to meet with Rice on Wednesday, suggested that she would be better suited to run
            the Democratic National Committee than State. If Rice can't soothe the egos of some cranky G.O.P. pots, how
            would she negotiate with China?

            Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the soft-spoken ranking member on the homeland security committee, hasn't
            been part of this shrill debate. Though they had met only once or twice, Collins agreed to introduce Rice to the
            Foreign Relations Committee in 2009 when Rice was nominated as the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Rice's
            grandparents immigrated from Jamaica to Portland, Maine.

            "I don't bear any animus to her at all," the senator said. "In fact, to the contrary."

            But she said she is "troubled" by Rice's role. "If I wanted to be secretary of state," Collins observed, "I would
            not go on television and perform what was essentially a political role."

            Collins drew up a list of questions to ask Rice at their one-on-one hourlong meeting slated for Wednesday. She
            wants Rice to explain how she could promote a story "with such certitude" about a spontaneous demonstration
            over the anti-Muslim video that was so at odds with the classified information to which the ambassador had
            access. (It was also at odds with common sense, given that there were Al Qaeda sympathizers among the rebel
            army members that overthrew Muarrunar el-Qaddafi with help from the U.S. — an intervention advocated by
            Rice — and Islamic extremist training camps in the Benghazi area.)

            The F.B.I. interviewed survivors of the attack in Germany and, according to some senators, had done most of
            the interviews of those on site by Sept. 15, the day before Rice went on TV, and established that there was no
            protest. Collins wants to learn if the F.B.I. had failed to communicate that, or if they had communicated it and
            Rice went ahead anyway?

            When Rice heard the president of the Libyan National Congress tell Bob Schieffer on "Face the Nation," right
            before her appearance, that 50 people had been arrested who were either foreign or affiliated with or
            sympathized with Al Qaeda, why did she push back with the video story? "Why wouldn't she think what the
            Libyan president said mattered?" Collins wondered.

            Why did Rice say on ABC News's "This Week," that "two of the four Americans who were killed were there
            providing security"? Rice was referring to the two ex-Navy SEAL team members who were C.I.A. security
            officers working on a base about a mile away. "They weren't there to protect Ambassador Stevens," Collins
            said. "That wasn't their job."

            Rice also said that "we had a substantial security presence with our personnel" — which was clearly not the
            case. Collins wants to know Rice's basis for saying on ABC that the attacks were "a direct result of a heinous
            and offensive video." And why did she say "a small number of people" came to the consulate to protest, when
            that phrase is not in her talking points? Collins is curious why Rice is not angrier, if, as she insists, she was
            repeating what she was told. "I'd be furious at the White House and F.B.I. and intelligence community for
            destroying my credibility," the senator said.

           Collins said that before she would support Rice for secretary of state, she needs to ascertain what was really
           going on. "Did they think admitting that it was an Al Qaeda attack would destroy the narrative of Libya being a
           big success story?" Collins asked. As one of the administration champions of intervening in Libya, Rice was
           surely rooting for that success story herself.
