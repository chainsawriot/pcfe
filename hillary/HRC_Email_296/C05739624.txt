             Re: Morsi's private conversations & coordination with Magariaf


             SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
             highest levels of European governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.

                    I. Late in the day on September 14, 2012, Egyptian President Mohamad Morsi told senior
            European diplomats that he is increasingly concerned the current anti-U.S. and anti-Western violence
            spreading through Cairo and into the rest of Egypt may be part of an effort by his Salafist political
            rivals to destabilize his government, which many of them believe is too moderate in its positions
            regarding Islam, Israel, and the non-Muslim world. According to this source, Morsi, who is in
            Brussels for meetings with the European Union (EU), was particularly concerned over a message from
            Army commander General Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, that Islamist guerrillas, believed to be drawn
            primarily from the Sawarki Bedouin tribe, had launched an attack on a base of the International
            Peacekeeping Force (IPF) in the Sinai. The General reported that the 1500 United Nations troops at
            the base, including some U.S. forces, were under heavy attack and casualty figures were not yet
            known. Morsi stated that this fight was an example of radical anti-government forces and Salafist
            Islamist dissidents taking advantage of the current situation to carry out attacks that demonstrate his
            government is unable to protect Western personnel and facilities in Egypt. Morsi stated that the
            success or failure of his regime is directly tied to his ability to establish a moderate Islamic state that
            can work with western business interests.

                    2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, the current wave of violence is related
            to an ongoing struggle between Salafist and Sufi Muslims throughout Egypt. What makes it more
            frustrating for Morsi is that much of the violence appears to be inspired by members of the Salafist al
            Nour Party, the coalition partner of Morsi's Freedom and Justice Party (RIP) in the new Egyptian
            Parliament. According to this individual, Morsi delayed condemning the initial attacks on the U.S.

            Embassy out of concern that his opponents would use such a statement to move against his
            government. Late on the evening of September 13, 2012, Mohammed Badie, the Supreme Guide of
            the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood (MB), sent a message to Morsi warning that he and the Supreme
            Guidance Council were concerned that the situation around the U.S. Embassy was getting out of
            control and that, difficult as it might seem, he had to take tough measures against the demonstrators,
            and protect the interests of the U.S. and other Western Governments. In a telephone discussion with
            Saad al-Katany, the MB/Freedom and Justice Party (MB/KIP) Speaker of the lower house of
            parliament, Morsi admitted that he had felt constrained from acting, given his past history of poor
            personal relations with the leaders of al Nour. Al-Katany urged him to gain control of the situation.)

                    3. On September 14, Morsi also stated to an EU official that he had received extremely forceful
            messages from both the U.S. State Department and the Office of the U.S. President, leaving no doubt
            in his mind that the U.S. â€”Egyptian relations and more than $1billion in U.S. aid were at stake in this
            matter. Morsi added that since much of this aid goes to the Egyptian Army, he and al-Katany agreed
            that actions that put it in jeopardy would also damage the new Egyptian administration's current
            good relationship with the Army. Accordingly, Morsi instructed the military and security forces to use
            all necessary force short of lethal measures to protect U.S. and Western facilities. In a private
            conversation, Morsi stated that he felt he is losing control of the political situation and fears that if the
            current fighting results in deaths, either of demonstrators, U.S. diplomats, Egyptian security
            personnel, or UN peacekeepers, the situation may spin out of control and his government could fall.
            Al-Katany agreed, but said that taking no action would guarantee disaster. They agreed that when the
            situation calms down they will have to deal with the al Nour party, which they fear will, in the future,
            take advantage of circumstances to try to destabilize Morsi's administration. With this in mind, Morsi
            ordered al-Sissi to direct the commanders of Military Intelligence (MI -Mukhabarat el-Khabeya) to
            step up operations collecting information on the activities of the al Nour leadership, focusing on any
            contacts with potentially violent Salafist dissidents.

                    4. (Source Comment: A separate sensitive source also noted that General al-Sissi is warning
            Morsi about press reports that the person who made the controversial internet film at the heart of this
            situation is an Egyptian Coptic Christian. The General cautioned that as this report gains wider
            circulation, the government and the Army must prepare for violent attacks by Islamists against that
            community, which makes up ten (10) percent of the Egyptian population.)


                   5. A separate sensitive source noted that for his part, al-Sissi is prepared to to have his troops
           take harsh measures against any demonstrators who attack Western personnel and facilities. The
           General is also concerned that the al Nour leaders are even more dangerous than Morsi realizes, and
           he has ordered the MI to increase technical and physical surveillance of these individuals. In
           addition, he stated in private that Morsi and al-Katany spoke with Libyan President Mohammed
           Yussef el Ma.gariaf, and they had all agreed that military and security officials in Egypt and Libya will
           cooperate in an effort to track links between the violence in Cairo and Benghazi. Al-Sissi has ordered
           Special Forces units to step up patrols in the Egypt-Libya border region, while the MI will monitor
           communications between dissidents; primarily Salafists, in both countries. According to this source
           the General is convinced that these dissidents are seizing the opportunity presented by the current
           unrest to move against the governments of Morsi and al-Magariaf. He also received permission from
           Morsi to step up cooperation with his counterparts in the U.S. and Western Europe to deal with this
           situation and al-Sissi believes al-Magariaf has given similar instructions to Libyan military and
           security officials.

                 6. (Source Comment: According to a separate sensitive source, al-Sissi believes that, given his
           new orders from Mori, the Army can, for the most part, protect Western facilities and personnel in
           Egypt. But the General is concerned that the security services can never completely eliminate the

                     example of radical anti-government forces and Salafist Islamist dissidents taking advantage of
