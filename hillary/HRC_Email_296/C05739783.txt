           Subject: Quick readout from Jeff Feitman in Tried

           Jeff asked me to pass along the following readout. Please excuse the free-form list of subjects but I wanted to get this
           out quickly to as wide an audience as possible. Please feel free to share with others I've missed.

                1. State of Embassy Tripoli facility: While admitting he is no engineer, Jeff agrees with the initial OBO assessment
                    that the facility is not salvageable — the condition is "shocking and photos doesn't do it justice.' Floors have
                    collapsed, the ballistic glass and metal support beams have melted, and it has been totally trashed. Jeff asked
                    for their help on Embassy security; they took this on board but noted that they are still in the process of trying to
                    secure the country.
                2. Abdel JAI and Mahmoud fibril both to NY next week: Both will travel to NY next week for the high level
                    meeting on the 20th. Jain will then return to Libya, and Jibril will remain in NY to deliver the Libyan address to
                    UNGA on the 24th. The plan is to have the new cabinet in place by the 2e, with Jibril the likely PM. Jeff pressed
                    them on including a woman on their UN delegation. He also made all of the points about the need for the INC
                    to take the lead in NY in outlining what they are seeking from the int'l community but they didn't share their
                    ideas about what they will say.
                    Action needed: Jalil needs a visa,                                                                                      B3 INA
                    understand MAG is working this now but we will need to facilitate issuance (likely by Embassy Tunis).
                1 Saadi Qadhafl and Niger: Jibril has sent a letter to Niamey and is sending the Deputy FM there to talk about
                    Saadi. The Libyan request to Niger will be two-fold: 1. Detain him properly (they understand he is free to roam
                    about 2. Be prepared to return him to Libya to stand trial.
                4. Weapons issues: They will ask OPCW to come back and they want them to say yes but the Libyans are picking
                    up noises from OPCW that they can't accept a request from the INC now because the INC is not a UN
                    member. (comment: I know the credentials issue is being worked this week in NY but Ken Ward please convey
                    to OPCW that they need to take the Libyans up on their request asap.)
                S. OUP mandate: they think NATO should stay beyond an additional 30 days (I told Jeff I thought we were now
                    looking at 90 in any case).
                6. Pan Am 103: Jeff raised the issue with Jaill and the Justice Minister, which they took on board; Justice Minister
                    said "this was a crime against humanity so Libya has to cooperate."
                7. Treatment of Libyans of color and African migrants: Jeff raised and they responded with the right things.
                8. Oil fund paper: Passed to INC.
                9. "Boots on the ground": they asked about the comments they had seen and expressed their concern over
                    them. Jeff explained that these were people to help provide security for our people and facility and why they
                    were necessary.                                                                                                             B5
