               Subject:                           Les Gelb on the Obama response


               The whole thing is worth a read, but a very tough judge gives you and the President credit:

               By any standard of reason, President Obama and Secretary of State Canton conducted themselves very well amid the
               confusion and crises Of course they didn't do everything perfectly; for example, some unidentified administration official
               disowned the embassy statement condemning the video. Such creepiness served only to make it look like Obama was
               running for cover at the expense of our embattled diplomats. But minor miscues aside, Obama and Clinton nailed the
               main points, especially Clinton. In her first statement soon after the riots, here s what she said The United States
               deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back
               to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind."
