            Beth Jones has confirmed that Chris's notebook is in the hands of the Italian CG.

            The plan is for the CG to travel on Sat (in one week) to Tripoli and give the notebook to the Italian Amb who will get it to
            Greg. In the meantime, the Italians will secure it in Benghazi.

            Regards
