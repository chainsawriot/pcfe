             Thank you.
             We are offering 7prn to Holder and waiting to hear if he would like to speak secure.

             We likely won't hear from the King for several hours but will keep you posted as soon as we do.

             Yes, just confirmed that Dan will come at 9am tomorrow.

             Ops can pick up the pouch in about 30 minutes. Does that work for you? Secret Service can grab it from the bench if
             you'd like.
