              Subject: Stevens Update On Benghazi -- 4/26 7arn

              All:

              Ops has provided below the latest Stevens update on Benghazi:

                   • Traffkaccidenti Police have accepted the USG version of the story: that it was an accident and the
                     victims were not wearing seathelts. The USG employees were returning from the airport when the
                     incident occurred. A total of four people died and six injured. USG employee Mjuries are light if any.
                     Our people are standing by pending official USG instructions. Stevens notes there is a UK flight
                     tomorrow they could be on if necessary. The TNC wants to do a press release to quell the rumor mill.
                     Stevens will send the draft back to Department for L and PA clearance.

                   • The British envoy departs tomorrow on permanent change of station. There will be a gap before his
                     replacement, John Jenkins, arrives from Baghdad.

                   •   INC head Malunoud fibril will be going to Jordan and will not be back in Benghazi until Friday. The
                       development is likely to he met with additional criticism that he is spending too much time abroad at the
                       expense of other government affairs.

              Thanks,

              Dan
