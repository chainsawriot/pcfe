               Subject: Talk with PM

              I called PM el-Keib this morning to get his take on what we were all hearing about TNC final decisions to dismiss the
              government, etc. I told him that after the British Ambassador and I had spoken to him and Jalil on Sunday, we had
              hoped that these public skirmishes would end and that the government could focus on security and the elections. The
              PM said that he had in fact met with Jalil on Monday and agreed to work together for the good of the nation. On
              Tuesday, the PM had met with several Council members and had brought along proposed changes in some of the
              ministerial portfolios. He sensed there was agreement from the Council members present and thought he had
              succeeded in quelling the public discontent. Unfortunately, he continued, more public threats, etc. were issued and by
              Wednesday evening he had had enough. That prompted his critical remarks in a press interview demanding that the TNC
              stop interfering in the government's business and let him and his government do the work they needed to do without all
              this negative background noise. He told me that we should not be concerned about last night's "rumors" and that he
              would continue to work to end these fratricidal disputes. For his own role, he said he would be just as happy to give up
              his post if matters came to that We will continue to try to reach out to other contacts today to see if in fact the Council
              does intend to act against the government. But while the PM is clearly frustrated, he also seemed to believe that the
              current strife will not result in any major shake-up, at least for the time being.
