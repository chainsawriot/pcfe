            GOP Lawmakers Demand Details Of Deadly Attack On U.S. Consulate In Libya By Ernesto LondoPlo The Washington Post
            Thursday, September 27, 2012

            Republican lawmakers demanded Wednesday that the Obama administration disclose details about the Sept. 11 attack
            on U.S. compounds in eastern Libya that killed an ambassador and three other government employees.

              The requests for information about the assault, including any cables about security written by slain Ambassador J.
              Christopher Stevens, underscored the extent to which the incident has become a political liability for the White House
              during the final stretch of President Obama's reelection campaign.

              Lawmakers are asking whether the administration overlooked warning signs about the threat level in Libya, and some
              have suggested the security at the U.S. installations in Benghazi was inadequate.

              Senior administration officials, including Secretary of State Hillary Rodharn Clinton and Director of National Intelligence
              James Clapper, have briefed Congress. But details on the events in Benghazi are still being assembled.

              After initially describing the attack as a spontaneous act of mob violence in response to a video that disparaged Islam,
              administration officials in recent days have begun to suggest it was a welt planned terrorist attack.

              Clinton mentioned the Benghazi assault Wednesday during a speech at the U.N. General Assembly about the rise of
              extremist militants in North Africa. Clinton did not specifically ascribe the attack to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the
              African offshoot of the terrorist organization, but she said the violent deaths of American officials underscored the
              importance of defeating the group.

              "With a larger safe haven and increased freedom to maneuver, terrorists are seeking to extend their reach and their
              networks in multiple directions," Clinton said, according to an official transcript of her remarks. "And they are now
              working with other violent extremists to undermine the democratic transitions underway in North Africa, as we
              tragically saw in Benghazi."

              U.S, counterterrorism chief Matthew Olsen told the the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee
              last week that analysts are exploring whether al-Ofeeda's African branch played a role in the attack. Investigators are also
              looking for evidence linking the assault to leaders of Ansar al-Sharia, a loose coalition of hard-line militants with a strong
              presence in Libya.

              Republican congressmen took the administration to task for what they called contradictory statements about the
              Benghazi raid and initial information portraying it as a protest that turned violent.

              "This seems like a pre-9/11 mindset — treating an act of war solely as a criminal matter," a group of 10 congressmen
              wrote Wednesday in a letter to the president, referring to the 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States.

             Sens. Johnny Isakson (Ga.) and Bob Corker (Tenn.), GOP members of the Foreign Relations Committee, sent a letter
             Tuesday to Clinton expressing concern about the 'lack of security preparations made despite a demonstrable increase in
             risks to US. officials and facilities in Benghazi.' The senators asked to see any relevant cables that Stevens wrote in the
             days before he was killed.

             The State Department has launched a type of probe called an accountability panel. The FBI is conducting a separate
             criminal investigation into the incident. Citing the inquiries, administration officials have provided few new details about
             the Benghazi raid in recent days. US. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice made the most extensive remarks
             about the attack four days after the deaths. Her early accounts have come under scrutiny because they suggested that
             U.S. government officials did not believe the assault had been well planned or coordinated.

             "We look forward to a timely response that explains how the US. ambassador to the United Nations could characterize
             an attack on a U.S. consulate so inaccurately," Sen. John McCain (Ariz.) and three fellow Republican senators wrote
             Wednesday in a letter to Rice.

                           Dear Mr. President:

                                   We are writing to express grave concern about the events surrounding the terrorist attack
                           in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012, that led to the murder of the United States
                           Ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens, and three other I_J,S. Government personnel. We
                           profoundly regret the loss of lives and seek to ensure all necessary steps are being taken to bring
                           the perpetrators to justice and prevent similar future attacks, While we appreciate your
                           willingness to provide the House of Representatives with an interagency briefing last week,
                           many of the members questions were left 'unanswered. To that end, we are seeking additional
                           information regarding the intelligence leading up to the attack, the security posture of our
                           embassy, the role former Guantanamo Bay detainees may have played, as well as the way
                           forward in Libya and, indeed, the region.

                                    We are also disturbed by the public statements made by members of the Administration
                           that would lead the American public to believe this attack was a protest gone wrong, rather than
                           what it truly was — a terrorist attack on the United States on the anniversary of 9/11. Decades
                           after al Qaeda attacked our embassies in East Africa, which catalyzed a series of events that led
                           to the attacks on 9/11, it appears they executed a highly coordinated and well-planned attacked
                           against us again. Clearly, the threat from al Qaeda and affiliated groups has metastasized; yet we
                           do not appear to be learning from the past. For example, although brave Americans were once
                           more murdered by terrorists, it seems our response is to rely on a late-to-the-scene FBI
                           investigation. Media reports indicate investigators were prevented from arriving in Libya until
                           more than a week after the attack, but it is not clear that they have gone to Benghazi and have
                           therefore, been unable to secure valuable information, such as the Ambassador's journal. The
                           FBI has expertise in these situations, and they have a role to play However, this seems like a
                           pre 9/11 mindset - treating an act of war solely as a criminal matter, rather than also prioritizing
                           the gathering of intelligence to prevent future attacks. Moreover, given that violence in the
                           region continues unabated, what actions are we undertaking to deter terrorists fronl capitalizing
