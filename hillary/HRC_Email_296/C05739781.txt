             Jake I was so moved by Hillary's powerful presence today on the screen as I watched along with millions in America
             and around the world. She was emphathetic and unflinching and inspiring; she was wise and steady and strong. My 80
             year old mother called from LA to say "She was like our rock of Gibraltar". What greater compliment for the Secretary of
             State on such an awful day? l salute her as well as you and your colleagues who crafted her remarks under tremendous
             time and factual constraints. it really showed everyone the stuff of which she's made. With admiration and affection --
             Liz
