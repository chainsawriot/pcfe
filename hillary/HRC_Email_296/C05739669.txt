              Politicallecsmomic developments

              Coda McCain: Senator McCain had an enthusiastic reception in Benghazi. The TNC welcomed his strong
              statements of support, and US flag-waving Libyans cheered him wherever he went. The INC praised the
              introduction of US Predator aircraft and asked that the US jam Libyan television broadcasting, The NC's
              finance minister told him that his top ptiotities are to obtain a line of credit to meet basic needs, and to find a
              way under the sanctions to allow trade with the liberated parts of Libya. He was impressed by the civilian
              leadership but came away with serious doubts about the military's leadership, organization, and capabilities. He
              was heartened to hear that the MC plans to shake up the military leadership and appoint a minister of defense--
              equivalent as early as next week. In a press conference, he advocated the use of more effective US strike
              aircraft in the NATO missions and US facilitation of 3"I party arms transfers to the rebels; be stopped short of
              endorsing the introduction of US military advisers, saying that role could be filled by others. He was clearly
              moved by the plight of the people of Misrata and visited a hospital where he met a number of patients who were
              severely wounded in the fighting there. The Human Rights Watch representative in Benghazi and a INC
              member from Misrata briefed him on the situation there.

              Consular issue: Conoff received the deceased Amcies personal effects from the IOM representative in Benghazi
              and submitted them to the UK delegation in Benghazi in order to be flown out with the body. The Aincifs body
              departed Libya on the evening of 22 April.

              Injured Arncit               will board a UNICEF-chartered ship that will depart Misurata at 2300 local time on           B6
              22 April and will arrive in Malta approximately 22 hours later.

              A memorial service for the journalists was held at the Tibesti hotel, attended by INC deputy chairman Abd al-
              Hafidh Goglia, the UK envoy, and the US envoy. Ghoga and the envoys also delivered remarks.
