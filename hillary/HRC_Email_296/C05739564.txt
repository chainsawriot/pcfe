            (SBU) I had back-to-back phone calls this morning from Qatari PM/FM Hamad bin Jassim and UAE Foreign
            Minister Abdullah bin Zayed. The content was virtually identical, su esting either rare coincidence or, more
            likely, an unusual level of UAE-Qatari coordination at yesterday's Arab League meeting. Main points (mostly
            Libya related but one Palestinian-related) are as follows:

            (SBU) No-Fly Zone: The Arab League has now called for a NFZ; the UNSC needs to act. Syria was the last hold-
            out, but the resolution passed. Time is wasting. Both HbJ and AbZ made the right kind of noises (but still less
            than a solid commitment) that there would be some kind of Qatari and Emirati participation in an
            international effort. Their chicken-and-egg question to me was, are we going to support a NFZ? If we are,
            then we can talk about the other participation.

            (SBU) Recognizing the Council: Both urged us to do so. I noted that the Arab League statement fell short of
            recognition. They urged us to find some kind of language that would suggest moving in that direction, and I
            noted our decisions to suspend the operations of the Libyan Embassy, have S meet with Mahmoud Jibril of the
            Council, and send a diplomatic representative to Benghazi. They pushed for more, with HbJ going to far as to
            say that recognition of the Council will help underscore to Qadhafi and his circle that he's finished.

           (SBU) Jibril meeting: They each said the same thing that Gene Cretz has picked up separately, that Jibril
           doesn't want media for his meeting with S unless he feels that there will be something significant out of the
           meeting. HbJ is providing a plane for Jibril to get to Paris. HbJ more than AbZ agreed with me that the
           meeting itself is a significant deliverable; AbZ urged us not to be slower or quieter than France.

           (SBU) West Bank/Gaza: Both reacted negatively to Israeli announcements regarding "hundreds of houses" in
           the West Bank. They asked if we were going to say anything; I noted we were still at this point getting the
           facts. "Jeff, you guys just aren't serious," AbZ complained. I noted the political context, in which a family was
           brutally murdered.
