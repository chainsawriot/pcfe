           Jake: I have been reading this over and over and it just seemed a bit odd to me. I finally figured out that I think the
           source has somehow confused two Bel-Hajs: One is our boy who accused us and the Brits of rendition-Abdul Hakim Bel-
           Haj and a second one is Larnin Bel Haj, an Islamist leader who I believe had previously I believe somehow been involved
           In Sudan but was now back in his native Ubya. The latter is the head of the JCP and MB. The former is of the former LIFG
           and now the Libyan Islamist Movement for Change and the premier Western Brigade commander whose group had
           control over Matega Airport for several months after October 23 and who tried to make himself the Supreme Military
           Council Commander of Tripoli before the TNC leadership stepped in several months ago. Let me try to untangle this and
           see if any of it jibes with the reality we are seeing.

           Very interesting report. By chance, I met with our insightful                     in Benghazi yesterday and we discussed        B6
           the LIVIB's electoral prospects. He didn't think they would have a large following b/c they don't have a strong
           organization and because most Libyans view the LMB as a branch of the Egyptian MB, and Libyans don't want to be
           ruled by Egypt. He did not mention the interesting point below about the LMB as a counterbalance to the eastern based
           Federalists. He did emphasize, though, that the Federalist movement has widespread support in the east and will
           continue to up the ante with Tripoli, including possibly making a move on the oil production in that part of the country
           (AGOCO, a large state-owned oil company, is based in Benghazi). -- Chris

            Below is the latest report from NBC's contact; would be interested in your reactions.

            SOURCE:
             Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of European
            Governments, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, and Western Intelligence and security services.

                      1.
               During the last week of March 2012, the leaders of the National Transitional Council (NTC) regime in Libya discussed
            the rising popularity and independence of the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood (LMB) in preparation for the national
            parliamentary elections scheduled for July 2012.
              According to a source with direct access to these discussions, President Mustafa Abdel Jalil stated in very direct terms
            that he sees the emergence of the LMB as a major factor in the upcoming elections, which are already complicated by
            the Federalist movement for the semi-autonomous status of the historic Eastern Libyan region of
              Cyrenaica (Berea in Arabic).
              Minister of Defense Ousama al Juwall and Prime Minister Abdurrahim el Keib both believe that the rise of the LMB,
            which was a relatively minor member of the NTC until November 2011, is, in fact, related to the Federalist movement in
            Eastern Libya.
              According to at Juwali, a native of the Western Libyan region of Zintan, the LMB is drawing strength from people who
            fear that the Federalist movement in Barge will result in that region dominating the country, gaining control of an
            inordinate share of the country's oil and mineral reserves.
              For his part, Jalil stated that he agrees with Oil Minister Abcluirahman Ben 'lima that if matters are not resolved by the
            July elections, the unsettled nature of the political process in Libya will damage the country's image as a business
            partner and confuse foreign banks and oil firms attempting to open new contacts with the new Libyan Government, or
            reactivate existing agreements.
                      2.
              According to a sensitive source, while discussing this matter with Dr Abd al-Nasser Shamata, the head of the Crisis
            Management Unit in the NTC, Prime Minister el Keib stated that the most problematic aspect of the rise of the LMB is
            the leadership role taken by Islamist militia leader General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj.
              In the opinion of this source, the NTC leadership sees Belhaj as one of the greatest threats to the long term success of
            their regime.
              Al Juwali also notes that Belhaj is the head of the founding committee for the LMB's Justice and Construction Party
            (JCP). As the Federalist movement took hold in early March 2012, al Juwali, under instruction from el Keib and Jalil, met
            with Belhaj and other Western militia leaders to arrange for their support in the event military force is needed to hold
            the country together.
              Beihaj represented the most effective of the Western militias.
                      3.
              According to the Minister of Defense, this situation with the Federalist movement enhanced Belhaj's prestige at the
            time he was working to secure a leadership role in the LMB and the JCP.
              El Keib and Jalil are concerned that, despite the fact that the LMB has a limited base after years of suppression by the
            regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi, they will appeal to those Libyans who believe that the NTC regime is
            under the influence of the United States and Western Europe.
              The activities of Belhaj in both the LMB and the JCP reinforce this view.
              Jalil finds this situation frustrating, particularly in the light of his regular assurances that Libya would operate under
            Islamic law, and while maintaining appropriate ties to the West, will remain hostile to Israel.

              In a private conversation, Jalil stated that he is working to balance the internal political realities of Libya against the
            concerns of the international business community.
             The President is concerned that the appointment of BenYezza as Oil Minister in October 2011 provided the JCP with a
            tangible concern to use against NTC candidates during the July elections.
             After his long experience as a senior official of the Multinational Italian Oil Firm ENI, Ben Yezza is viewed by Belhaj and
            many members of the LMB as a symbol of the issue they will pursue in the national election, the idea that NTC, like the
            Qaddafi, regime is corrupt and involved in allowing foreign interests to control the nation's mineral wealth.
             That said, Jalil continues to agree with el Keib that Ben Yezza is an excellent administrator, and in the long run will play
            an important role in effectively managing the nation's mineral wealth.)
                    5.
               According to an extremely sensitive source, Jalil and his advisors have been in contact with Supreme Guide Mohamed
            Badie, the leader of the much larger and more powerful Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood (EMB).
             This contact is largely based on the President's need to address reports he has received that the LMB is reaching out to
            Badie and his advisors for support.
             This effort is particularly important given the belief among NTC leaders that the EMB and its Freedom and Justice Party
            (FJP) will control the Government of Egypt as that country moves to civilian rule later in 2012. In the opinion of this
            source, Badie is sympathetic to Jalirs position, especially since the Libyan President and el Keib were members of the
            EMB during their student days in Egypt.
             The Supreme Guide will, according to J3111, work to influence the LMB to establish a cooperative effort with the NTC.
             Sadie will point out the fact that his ability to cooperate with both the Supreme Council for the Armed Force (SCAF), as
            well as the Salafist al Nour party, helped establish the EMB as the dominant political force in Egypt, while avoiding high
           levels of violence.
                    6.
             (Source Comment: An extremely sensitive source within the EMB agreed that Badie and Jalil have spoken in an effort to
           develop a plan to deal with the LMB.
             According to this source, Jalil told Badie that the LMB and the JCP are far more intolerant of foreign business and
           banking interests than the NTC, and a strong showing in the July elections will strengthen Belhaj and other conservative
           Islamists, adversely affecting the Libyan economy, which in turn will cause problems for Egypt as it recovers from its own
           revolution in 2011.
             Jalil emphasized that at this point the NTC has managed to avoid violent outbursts between competing groups, even in
           the face of the Federalist movement in the East, in a region that borders Egypt.
             He warned that an LMB/JCP victory might change this and lead to increased violence between rival militias that could
           wash over into Egypt.)
                     7.
             According to a sensitive source, the LMB has a complex history and Jalil and el Keib believe this past may hold some
           points which can be used against the Brotherhood and the JCP in the July elections.
             The TNTC leaders know that after Qaddafi came to power in 1969, the LMB was repressed and many of its leaders were
           executed publicly. Eventually the Brotherhood, having reestablished itself in the United States and Europe, entered into
           a dialogue with the Qaddafi regime 1999, and in 2005 began a series of negotiations with Saif                  Qaddafi, whose
           goal was to co-opt and neutralize opposition groups, particularly Islamist ones.
                    8.
             According to this individual, Belhaj and the other Islamist leaders mistrusted the LMB during the first months of the
           2011 revolution.
             However, Belhaj eventually established a working relationship with Fawzi Abu Kitef, the head of the Revolutionary
           Brigades Coalition in Eastern Libya and the former deputy defense minister in the NTC. Abu Kitef was a leading figure in
           the LMB who spent more than 18 years in prison, including the notorious facility at Abu Selim. Under Abu Kitef and
           leaders like Dr. Abdullah Shamia, who was in charge of the economic committee of the NTC, the Brotherhood
           established itself as a unique group within the Jain/el Keib regime; serving there until they began to plan for
           independent political activity in late 2011 and early 2012.
                    9.
            In early 2012, as the relationship between the NTC and Belhaj and the other Islamists deteriorated in the face of
           regional and ethnic power struggles, the LMB leadership, in coordination with Belhaj began to look at an independent
           political effort in the parliamentary elections. During its first public conference in Benghazi during November 2011, the

          LIMB elected a new leader, increased its consultative council membership from 11 to 30 leaders, and decided to form a
          political party; the JCP.
           Mohammed Swan, the former head of the Libyan LMB's Consultative Council, won a tight victory over longtime LMB
          leader SoOman Abd al-Qadr, to become the first leader of the JCP. Bashir al-Kubty was elected General Observer of the
          LMB.
                  10. (Source comment: According to an individual with excellent access, the LMB leaders are sensitive to charges
          that the JCP is a party with a narrow religious agenda, and they encouraged Walid al-Sakran, non-member of the LMB, to
          compete as a candidate for JCP leadership.
           That said Belhaj and other Islamist leaders believe that the LMB is set to follow the electoral path of Islamist success
          seen in Egypt, Tunisia, and other Arab countries.
           Belhaj now believes that the country will move forward under sharia law, administered by the Islamist bloc including
          the LIVIB/JCP
