            (SBU) Per Special Envoy Stevens:

            â€¢     The situation in Ajdabiyah has worsened to the point where Stevens is considering departure from Benghazi. The
            envoy's delegation is currently doing a phased checkout (paying the hotel bills, moving some comms to the boat,
            etc). He will monitor the situation to see if it deteriorates further, but no decision has been made on departure. He will
            wait 2-3 more hours, then revisit the decision on departure.

                 He received reports of shelling last night in Ajdabiyah as well as snipers shooting people in the city. AFRICOM
           reported Qadhafi's forces took the eastern and western gates of Ajdabiyah, with 5 vehicles at the eastern gate and 50 at
           the western gate. More Qadhafi forces are heading to Ajdabiyah from Brega.

                The Brits report Qadhafi forces are moving from Sirte to Brega, which they interpret as preparation for another
           assault on Ajdabiyah today.

                 He plans to discuss the situation further with the Brits, Turks, and the TNC to see if this is an irreversible
           situation. Departure would send a significant political signal, and would be interpreted as the U.S. losing confidence in
           the TNC. Initial message to the TNC would frame the departure as due to security grounds and as a temporary measure
           only.

                  Polaschik said she would discuss these developments with Amb. Cretz.

                If the group departs, the contract for the boat stipulates they return to Greece. One scenario could be the group
           stages elsewhere for a few days.




           Ops will continue to monitor the situation.
