            we are preparing for sandy here. parts of the city are crazy already. there is a crane on top of a high building on 57th
            street that they think is about to fall which is pretty crazy everything is shut down but its been a good conference call
            day!
            i talked to chris this morning and she is gathering things for you based on all the the things we discussed there is a
            possibility of 3 nice gowns and a lot of blouses and jackets i think we should find a day in ny sometime soon so you can
            try things on.
            Had long visit with my friend who was in benghazi will download in person but think very important for you to call                 B6
                      he injured DS officer he is now well enough to talk he doesnt want a visit but a check in call and asking him if
            he needs anything would be good monica will remind you of this
            Also heard from both the bush and reagan libraries over the last few days neither wants to host the osc.ar exhibit after it
            leaves little rock so i think we will focus on making that exhibit amazing and i will explain situation to odlr.
