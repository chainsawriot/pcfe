            Re: Who killed Younis


            SOURCE: Sources with access to the Libyan Transitional National Council as well as Western Intelligence and security
            services.


            During the morning of August 5, 2011 sources with direct access to senior levels of the Libyan Transnational Council
            (INC) stated in strictest confidence that the rebel military commander, General Atadel Fatah Younis was executed by
            security forces on orders from TNC Chairman Mustapha Jai. According to these sources, in late July 2011 INC security
            officers received what they believed to be reliable information that Younis was involved in a secret dialogue with Saif al-
            Islam Oaddafi, the son of Libyan leader Muammar Oaddafi. These discussions involved planning for Younis and Saif al-
            Islam to establish a government of reconciliation, with Muammar Qaddafi living in internal exile, and the INC being
            disbanded in favor of officials, and military officers loyal to Saif and Younis. Jalil ordered Younis arrest, and once he was
            in TNC custody instructed security officers to shoot the army commander.

            According to these knowledgeable individuals, Jaill and his supporters began disseminating the story that Younis was
            killed by either pro-Qaddafi forces, or Islamic radicals within the INC military. There is no indication that rebel Prime
            Minister Mahmoud Jabril, his senior aid Abdul Hafiz Ghoza, overall military commander General Abdelessalem Jalloud, or
            Younis replacement as field commander General Khaliffa Hefter were involved in the decision to execute Younis.

            Younis, was a former senior military officer and Minister of Interior in the Qaddafi regime,•who joined the rebels in
            February 2011, after serving his friend Muammar Qaddafi for over 40 years. When Younis first joined the rebel forces
            TNC security officers placed him under surveillance, believing that he might have been sent by Qaddafi to infiltrate their
            ranks. After a variety of loyalty tests he was welcomed into the rebel leadership, however it now appears that the security
            officers maintained their coverage of Younis and at some point in early July established his contact with Saif al-Islam
            Qaddafi.

            (Source Comment: Knowledgeable sources state that Jalil and his security forces felt that Younis' actions posed an
            immediate threat to the TNC and the ongoing revolution. Jalil made the decision to order Younis' arrest and execution
            rather than submit the matter for debate in the 31 member TNC. To date these sources add that there is no indication
            that none of the TNC members have challenged Jalil's decision.)

           Jalil remains committed to defeating the Qaddafi regime and is unwilling to negotiate with Saif al-Islam, or another
           representative of Muammar Qaddafi. According to these sources, Jail' believes reports that the Saif — Younis negotiations
           had at least the tacit support of the governments of the United States, Germany, France, and Russia.

          (Source comment: A separate sensitive source noted that Jalil remains highly suspicious of the activities of the four
          governments, and has privately expressed hostility toward their representatives in INC capital of Benghazi. That said he
          is well aware of the fact that he will need the support of the major powers, particularly the United States, to guarantee the
          future of the TNC government.)
