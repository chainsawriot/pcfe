            I just wanted to let all of you know that                                     called back at 3:40pm today to thank the
            Secretary for her condolence call earlier today.
                            I did tell her that the Secretary spoke with                                 She was aware of that                   B6

            FYI the Secretary has not yet spoken with                      I have the name and number on the call grid.
