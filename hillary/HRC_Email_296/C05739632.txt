            Bic sending more arms into a society generally — particularly when they are as disorganized and fragmented as they are
            — will result in more violence — against each other. Boys like to play with guns (trust me as the mother of sons). I am all
            for saying we have no objection to French doing it to increase pressure on Gaddafi, but in a tribal society where conflicts
            have been repressed for so long, adding even more weapons does not make sense. Obviously they can get weapons
            from other places, but nb that they are not awash in weapons now. I wrote something for New York Review of Books
            this week that builds on my farewell remarks and I think you will like it; will send it to you for weekend reading,

            Why are you dubious?

            One for the wall_

            For what it's worth, I am VERY dubious about arming the Libyan rebels. Our best bet is to keep pressure on BOTH sides
            to force a diplo solution. AMS
