            Subject: Tripoli trip

            Here are some highlights from Tripoli. Every meeting started with condolences on Chris Stevens and his three
            colleagues, and concern that Benghazi would permanently alter US Libyan relations. I used the fact of the Secretary's
            meeting with President Magaref in NY last week and Deputy secretary Burns' Tripoli visit as the best evidence of US
            determination to continue To build the relationship with this new democracy. In addition:

            - FBI INVESTIGATION: With the PM, DFM and Judicial leaders, I placed heavy emphasis on the importance of Libyan
            cooperation and transparency in the investigation. This was my primary focus; I stressed the point that Libya's
            performance will no doubt color American views on Libya at a time when Libya will want to burnish its reputation.

            - SECURITY: I stressed that social stability and economic growth will depend on a dramatic improvement in security. All
            agreed without
            hesitation. All said that Libya needs outside assistance, but when we
            discussed details of how to move forward on the bilateral programs we already have underway, each was quick to
            identify specific stumbling blocks on each Especially with the Acting FM, we also identified next steps.

            - TRAINING: We made progress on 1208, CBW, and MANPADS training programs - details to follow front channel. We
            will also follow up on judicial exchanges and forensic training.

            - NEW GOVT FORMATION: Abushagur described the negotiation process as the single most difficult professional
            challenge he has ever faced. He told us the government would be ready by October 3. Even though others warned us
            he would miss that deadline due to difficulty in reconciling the competing demands of various parties and individuals, he
            obviously made good on his Oct. 3 announcement undertaking.

            - DDR: Abushagur said there are three main groups of militants to
            reintegrate: part have jobs, part are heading back to university, and part will be offered vocational training. He said he
            will create a new Ministry of Human Development to oversee DDR; it's unclear how this new ministry will relate to
            numerous other GOL. efforts on this He expressed concern about the approximately 17,000 criminals released by
            Qacihafi, some of whom joined militias.

            - TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE: The political leaders and judges all pledged to strike a balance between respecting the rights
            of detainees and holding human rights violators accountable. They acknowledged the profound limitations of their
            justice system.

            - UNSMIL: I had a very good two hr meeting with General Smith to discuss how we can partner to help the new Libyan
            government improve security. He has good ideas on which we'll work closely.

            I had separate meetings with PM-elect Abushagur, Acting/Deputy FM Abdel Aziz, Supreme Court President Al Dhan,
            Deputy Prosecutor General Hassadi, NFA Party leader Jibril, UNSMIL Security Advisor General Smith, JCP (Muslim
            Brotherhood) Party political director Elbenanni, and civil society leaders.

            Morale at post is understandably rocky, but people are coping and continue to work hard in very difficult circumstances.
            There are some specific issues that the Department has already solved and others on which we can work to help the
            embassy in its determination to advance USG goals.

            I leave for Cairo in a few minutes tonight.
