              Your remarks this afternoon at Andrews were wonderful Thanks for doing so much for our institution on such a sad
              day.

              Just sent you a hi side note on visits to Jordan and Iraq, and look forward to catching up. Enjoy the weekend in the
              meantime.

              Bill
