             Another report--

             SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of
             European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
             1. As of the morning of July 6, an individual with access to the information stated in confidence that Libyan National
             Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil remains committed to a transfer of power to a popularly elected
             government; however, he is prepared to ex-tend the life of the NTC as a guarantor of stability for the Libyan people
             following the July 7, 2012 election for seats in a 200-member General National Congress (GNC). Jaifi realizes that 2.7
             million Libyans have registered to vote and are generally anxious to replace the increasingly unpopular NTC. That said,
             JAI expects the voting to lead to a period of confusion and he will not abandon his authority until the results are fixed.

            2. Jalil is also frustrated by the fact that during its eight-month tenure of the administration of Prime Minister Abclel
            Rahman el-Keib - who was appointed by the NTC was unable to provide solutions for Libya's long list of needs: a
            functioning justice system, a reconciliation process for officials who served the old administration, the disarming of
            militia, building functional national security forces, rebuilding destroyed areas, and delivering basic services such as
            healthcare.

            3. At the same time, outside of the oil sector, much of Libya's economy is stagnant, and in the opinion of Western
            security officials, lacks the government's go-ahead to restart public sector infrastructure contracts. In addition,
            international advisers and foreign investors are reluctant to return to an environment where the government will not
            sign long term agreements and cannot guarantee security.

            4. (Source Comment: According to an extremely sensitive source, Jalil continues to believe that this chaotic situation
            should not be surprising. He regularly points out that eight months is not a sufficient amount of time to build functioning
            institutions from the remnants of the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. The old regime featured a
             dysfunctional bureaucracy, idiosyncratic rule, and anti-institutionalism. Additionally, Jaill now reIalizes that due to
            pronounced incompetence and a lack of will to take unpopular decisions the el-Keib government also failed to make
            progress in the few areas where it could have achieved meaningful change. The towns of Sirte and Tawargha are
            representative of the situation in the countryside where people lost their homes in the conflict and have been living in
            temporary camps with limited ability to register and vote in their home district. Jalil has been urged by contacts in the
            French and Italian Governments to guarantee the rights of people across the country in particular, he has serious
            concerns as to whether or not supporters of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi in his hometown of Sirte will be
            included in the future political processes of the new Libya; if they are not allowed to vote by local militiamen. At the
            same time, the fighting between Libyan Arabs and Tebta tribesmen in the Kufra area threatens to prevent any voting
            there. Jalil has been warned that the NTC regulations now state that members of the National Army are not allowed to
            vote or run for office, which is a disincentive for armed militia brigade members to become legitimate soldiers.)

            5. This well informed individual believes that despite these flaws, the new government created by the July 7 election will
            eventually have the mandate to take the difficult decisions that can create a reconciliation process. Jalil will work to
            maintain order in this transition period, and finally reach his goal of creating a situation where the government can
            rebuild homes and restore sufficient law and order; allowing those in Sirte, Tawargha, Kufra, and throughout the rest of
            the country to live in their hometowns, establishing a situation where a true civil society can develop.

              6. Jail!, in conversations with the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB), and separately with liberal leader Ali
              Tarhouni, has acknowledged that the central government's top priority must be security and that the NTC has been
              unable to provide it. That said, Jail! and Minister of Defense Ousarna alefuwali have pledged to provide 30,000 to 40,000
              security personnel for election day to prevent similar incidents to the July 1 attack on Benghazi's election headquarters.
              In that case eastern federalists entered the building, where ballot papers were burned and ballot boxes destroyed.
              Similarly, these federalist forces are suspected of the attack on July 5 that burned down Ajdabiya's main storage centre
              for election materials.

             7. In the opinion of this individual, although those responsible for the Benghazi attack were pro-federalist, it has not
             been proven that they were members of the self-appointed Cyrenaican National Council (MC), whose military arm set
             up a roadblock in Wadi al-Ahmar on Libya's major east-west highway to demand that Cyrenaica get as many seats in the
             GNC as Tripolitania. Thus far, neither the CNC nor any other group has publicly stated that they intend to use violence to
             disrupt the elections. (Note: Under the current system Tripolitania will have 120 seats in the GNC, Cyrenaica (Barge) 62,
             and Fezzan in the South 18.)
