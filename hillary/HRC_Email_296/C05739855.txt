              VAN SUSTEREN: Senator, there is a report from the State Department that Secretary of State Hillary
              Clinton will testify on Benghazi before the middle of January. There has been some criticism of whether or
              not she has a concussion. I believe she has a concussion. What do you think?

              MCCAIN: I know that in my view, Secretary Clinton, when she said she assumed full responsibility, she
              certainly has a lot of responsibility for what happened in Benghazi. That's -- that report made that very
              clear. But I must say, I have never seen Secretary Clinton back down from a fight. And I have
              never seen her back down. And / believe that she is now not physically well enough to testify
              and she will testify the middle of January.
