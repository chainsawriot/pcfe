             Hi Philippe:

             Thanks very much for the note. I appreciate it.

             I have deep sympathy for what your team and the families of the victims are going through. In Baghdad years
             ago, someone I cared for very deeply lost her life with three others in the service of promoting our values
             overseas. This experience probably added to the intensity behind my questions and responses as well.

             In the interest of diplomacy and extending an olive branch: we should get a drink sometime, off the record.

             Best,
             Michael

               As you can imagine this has been an intense time for everyone at the State Department, including me.

              While I stand by the fundamental principles at issue here, that does not justify my unprofessional response to
              your emails. I particularly do not want my words to be a distraction from this tragedy.

               I apologize, both for my language and for my tone.

               Philippe
