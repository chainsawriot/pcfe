             Please very hold dose but a few tidbits from meeting one on one with Jeff:
             —Sahel/ Mali- will call for Envoy but not yet have named.
                                                                            Mandate for envoy will be 1) put meat on strategy bones            B5
             to include political, security, development, humanitarian, human rights 2) make sure UN is implementing throughout all
             agencies 3 mediation in Mali.

             --Syria - LB believes key is putting together transitional government;                                                              B5
                     Grateful for conversation with Robert LB doesn't plan on coming to DC but prefers to see S in NY. Jeff believes
             being based in Cairo is right thing for LB. Believes Morsi sincere in initiative but neither Jeff nor LB believe going
             anywhere. LB very concerned about ideas coming from Saudis and does not yet have date to go to Riyadh. Concerned
             about Bandar.
             --Libya- Absolutely agrees that Mitri should turn attention to security. Sent               to Beirut over weekend to see           B6
             Mitri and put security at top of agenda. Says we will like Mitri a lot. Also suggests when S sees Mikati that she say we will
             watch closely how they conduct themselves as chair of Foreign Affairs committee of AL. Jeff had been worried about
             Iranian initiative that Bill's call had killed.
