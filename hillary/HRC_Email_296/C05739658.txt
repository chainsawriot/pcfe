              VS intelligence warned embassy in Egypt of concern,
              about anti-Nluslirn film
              By Suzanne Kelly

              Concerned about the reaction to an anti-Muslim film that was gaining attention online, the U.S. intelligence
              community sent a cable to the embassy in Egypt warning of the concern, a U.S. official told CNN. It was sent
              48 hours before the protests in Cairo and Benghazi in Libya, the official said

              The cable did not discuss any specific threat, the official said. It warned instead about the existence of the
              movie being posted on the hamlet and the fact that it was gaining attention. A seven minute portion of the
              movie aired on an Egyptian TV talk show the weekend before the protests started, according to a Department of
              Homeland Security/Federal Bureau of Intelligence memo obtained by CNN on Thursday.

              The cable was not sent to the embassy in Tripoli, Libya or the consulate in Benghazi. US officials have said
              there was no intelligence ahead of the attack in Benghazi, which intelligence officials still believe was not
              planned. The White House spokesman Jay Carney said Friday there was no "actionable intelligence" indicating
              an attack was being planned.

              There are hundreds if not thousands of cables sent each day, the official said, and there was no specific threat
              attached to this one, because a specific threat was not known
