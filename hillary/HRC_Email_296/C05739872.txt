          Definitely. I can share around if you like, but it seems like a thin conspiracy theory.

          Re. France & UK behind Libya breakup

         SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of
         European Governments, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, and Western Intelligence and security services.

                  1. During the period between mid-January 2012 to March 2012 officers of the a French General Directorate for
         External Security ( Direction Generale de la Securite Exterieure — DGSE), and the British Secret Intelligence Service
         (SIS—MI-6) activated long standing contacts with tribal and civic leaders in Eastern Libya, in an effort to encourage them
         to establish a semi-autonomous zone in the historic province of Cyrenaica (Barge in Arabic). According to extremely
         knowledgeable sources, this effort was initiated by advisors to French President Nicholas Sarkozy after complaints from
         concerned French business leaders that the new Libyan Government was not rewarding appropriately French firms for the
         leading role France played in supporting the 2011 revolution against former Dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. SIS joined in
         this effort at the instruction of the office of Prime Minister David Cameron. This highly confidential effort comes in
         response to the inability of the National Transitional Council (NTC) government in Tripoli to organize the country
         effectively and deal with Western business interests in an effective and efficient manner.
                  2. The French and British business and intelligence officials believe that a semi autonomous regime in the
         Eastern city of Benghazi will be able to organize business opportunities in that region. This in turn will allow these
         Western firms to initiate new business projects. These same officials believe that there is also reduced threat from
         Islamist militias in the East. According to a knowledgeable source, French officials believe that this situation is the natural
         result of el-Keib's failure to organize the country and disarm the ethnic and regional militias who did the majority of the
         fighting against Qaddafi's forces during the revolution.

                  3. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, the French Government and business leaders
          actually expected to receive thirty five (35) per cent of new economic development in Libya after the fall of Qaddafi. Like
         many Western businessmen, these French officials made informal agreements with former Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril
         and his advisors, only to see these agreements ignored or delayed when Abdurrahim el-Keib became head of government
         in October 2011. In their opinion, once el-Keib moved the government from the Eastern city of Benghazi to the national
         capital at Tripoli, the government became inefficient and inaccessible. These individuals also believe that the
         appointment of Minister of Oil Abdulrahman Ben Yezza, who was a long time official of the Italian Oil Company (EN!), was
         a factor. According to these sources, the bulk of ENI's oil fields are in the Western part of Libya, and Ben Yezza focused
         his attentions on that region, while failing to effectively organize new business East of Benghazi. These same officials
         state that the influences of the Western militias, particularly those from the Zintan region, have weakened the influence of
         the Eastern Elders.)
                  4. An extremely sensitive source stated that the DGSE and SIS.intend to control the move toward a semi-
         autonomous state under a federal system. However, they have been surprised by el-Keib's intention, expressed both in
         public and in secret meetings with Minister of Defense OUSetrill al JuwaIi, a native of Zintan, to use force to hold the
         country together. El-Kelb is also committed to Ben Van, although he is frustrated by the chaotic situation in Tripoli. This
         atmosphere affects new business for the most port and has been extremely irritating for businessmen from France and
         other Western countries.
                  5. (Source Comment: In the opinion of well placed source with access to the former royal family (al Senussi),
         while these Western officials are focused on working around the chaotic business situation, they are risking a civil war,
         failing to recognized the longstanding and complicated relationship between the Eastern and Western parts of the
         country. Cladeafi, as an absolute dictator, suppressed these differences, which have reemerged with his defeat and
         death. In addition, al-Keib is talking to old acquaintances in the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, in an effort to apply their
         influence to the Eastern tribal Elders, and help hold the country together.)
