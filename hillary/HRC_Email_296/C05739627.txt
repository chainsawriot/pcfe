          Romney has an op-ed in today's Wall Street Journal playing off Stevens' murder to say Obama has put
          "security at risk," etc.
          According to Politico yesterday, there was an internal argument within the Romney campaign over                    B6
          Libya. Obviously, the neocons and the Rove oriented faction (Ed Gillespie, Rove's surrogate is now a
          Romney campaign adviser) beat Stuart Stevens.
          Romney is careening from tactic to tactic, hoping something will catch.
          I wouldn't be surprised to see Romney raise the specter of the Muslim Brotherhood in charge of Egypt
          & Libya as a bogeyman. I have heard him do this within the last week.

            According to a highly reliable source, as Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama prepare for the
            first presidential debate Wednesday night, top Republican operatives are primed to unleash a new
            two-pronged offensive that will attack Obama as weak on national security, and will be based, in part
            on new intelligence information regarding the attacks in Libya that killed U.S. ambassador Chris
            Stevens on September it.
           The source, who has first-hand knowledge of private, high-level conversations in the Romney camp
            that took place in Washington, DC last week, said that at various times the GOP strategists referred to
            their new operation as the Jimmy Carter Strategy or the October Surprise.
            He added that they planned to release what they hoped would be "a bombshell" that would make
            Libya and Obamta's foreign policy a major issue in the campaign. "My understanding is that they have
           come up with evidence that the Obama administration had positive intelligence that there was going
           to be a terrorist attack on the intelligence."
           The source described the Republicans as chortling with glee that the Obama administration
           "definitely had inter about the attack before it happened. "Intelligence can be graded in different
           ways," he added, 'and sometimes A and B don't get connected. But [the Romney campaign] will try to
           paint it to look like Obama had advance knowledge of the attack and is weak on terrorism."
           He said they were jubilant about their new strategy and said they intended to portray Obama as a
           helpless, Jimmy Carter-like president and to equate the tragedy in Libya with President Carter's failed
           attempt to rescue American hostages in Iran in 1980. "They are so excited about it," he said "Over
           and over again they talked about how it would be just like Jimmy Carter's failed raid. They feel it is
           going to give them a last-minute landslide in the election."
           The source, however, said he was dubious about the tactic. "To me, it is indicative that they have lost
           touch with a huge portion of the electorate," he said.
           The source declined to reveal the names of the GOP operatives who were present But he said, "These
           were the top guys in the party. It was a private, unguarded planning conversation." He further
           described participants in the meeting as consisting of well-known names tied to the big Republican
           super PACs and people who had access to high-level national security. intelligence.
           "As usual, Karl Rove wasn't present," he said, "but some were close to Rove."
           The source said that "there was quite a bit more" to the operation than simply revealing the
           intelligence regarding Libya. He declined to discuss what he described as the second phase of the
           operation.
           However, already there is evidence that the first phase of the operation is underway. On Wednesday,
           September 26, on Fox News, Karl Rove called Obarna's reaction to what happened in Libya
           "inexplicable" and added that Obama is "more intent on campaigning than meeting his
           responsibilities as commander-in-chief." He went on to warn that Obama's policies in Libya
           endangered the U.S. with regard to Iran, "I am astonished," Rove said "We are projecting weakness
           when we need to be projecting strength."
           Similarly, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a one-time GOP presidential hopeful who
           became known as the mayor of 9/11, followed Rove in criticizing Obama on the attack in Libya. "This
           is a deliberate attempt to cover up the truth, from an administration that claimed it wanted to be the
           most transparent in history," he told Fox News. "And it's the worst kind of cover-up: the kind of
           cover-up that involves our national security. This is a cover-up that involves the slaughter of four
           Americans."
           Giuliani added that the Obama White House wanted to dismiss the role played by al-Qaeda because it
           seemed to diminish the triumph of having killed Osama bin Laden. "1 think it's because they have this
           narrative that they defeated al-Qaeda," he said "They never say the words 'Islamic fundamentalist

             terrorism'. They want to wish it away. The president was moving on to Asia - he was going to declare
             this a great victory for himself and unfortunately, this terrible act of terror intervened in their very
             convenient narrative."
             Likewise, Bob Corker, Republican senator from Tennessee, described the administration's response to
            "the terrorist attack" in Libya as "bizarre." And on Sunday, September 30, both Mitt Romney and
            vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan joined in the attacks. "I think they want to do their very best to
             keep the people of America from understanding exactly what happened. We expect candor, we expect
            transparency, particularly as it relates to terrorism," Romney said.
            Added Ryan, "Why is he (Mama) not on the same page with his own administration officials who are
            saying that this is a terrorist attack? We'll leave it up to you to decide whether it's a cover-up or not"
            In an apparently related development, a Politico article posted last night said Romney advisers were
            divided over how aggressively to attack President Obama over his handling of the events in Libya. One
            unnamed Romney adviser described them as "a huge gift" to the campaign. "Across the board -
            domestic, economic and foreign-policy issues - President Mama has been outmatched by events," he
            said. "He's an observer of events, not a shaper of events. Everywhere you look, he's been outmatched."
            But other Romney advisers, led by media strategist Stuart Stevens, wanted to stick to the economy as
            the central issue. "They'll tell you that you've got to focus people on the fact that their economic
            prospects are not very good and all that," the aide told Politico. "Well, Romney's been trying to do that
            now since he clinched the nomination at the end of April — and he's failed. The president is better at
            deflecting attention from the bad news than Romney is at driving home the impact of the bad news on
            individual voters."
