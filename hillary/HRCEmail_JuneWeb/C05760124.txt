Tom and Craig--

 I spoke w Secretary Solis and thanked her for going to Honduras. She is eager for your briefing and advice when you
meet w her today. And it is very important that Craig is going w her to guide her thru this process.

  Oscar Arias told me he is very worried about whether the agreement will be implemented and is meeting w the
leading Presidential candidate this week to urge that he produce his party's 55 votes for restitution.

  I also spoke w Insulza who is focussed on the elections which I told him we would fully support. Is there more we
should be doing?

 Again, thanks for all your great work and good luck in the effort to get this across the finish line. Best, HRC
