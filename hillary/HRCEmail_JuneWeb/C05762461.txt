Executive Summary
Working from the province by province breakdowns of the 2009 and 2005
results, released by the Iranian Ministry of Interior, and from the 2006 census
as published by the official Statistical Centre of Iran, the following observations
about the official data and the debates surrounding it can be made.
 • In two conservative provinces, Mazandaran and Yazd, a turnout of
more than 100% was recorded.
 • At a provincial level, there is no correlation between the increased
turnout and the swing to Ahmadinejad. This challenges the notion that
Ahmadinejad's victory was due to the massive participation of a
 previously silent conservative majority.
 • In a third of all provinces, the official results would require that
Ahmadinejad took not only all former conservative voters, all former

centrist voters, and all new voters, but also up to 44% of former
Reformist voters, despite a decade of conflict between these two
groups.
• In 2005, as in 2001 and 1997, conservative candidates, and
Ahmadinejad in particular, were markedly unpopular in rural areas.
That the countryside always votes conservative is a myth. The claim
that this year Ahmadinejad swept the board in more rural provinces
flies in the face of these trends.

1. Irregularities in Voter Turnout
Two provinces show a turnout of over 100% and four more show a turnout of
over 90%. Regional variations in participation have disappeared. There is no
correlation between the increase in participation, and the swing to
Ahm adinejad.
Firstly, across the board there is a massive increase in turnout, with several
provinces increasing their participation rate by nearly 75%. This increase
results in substantially less variation in turnout between provinces, with the
standard deviation amongst provincial turnouts falling by just over 23% since
2005. The 2005 results show a substantial turnout gap, with seven provinces
recording turnout below 60%, and ten above 70%. In 2009, only two were
below 70% and 24 were above 80%. In fact, 21 out of 30 provinces had
turnouts within 5% of 83%. The data seems to suggest that regional variations
in participation have suddenly disappeared.
This makes the evident lack of any sort of correlation between the provinces
that saw an increase in turnout and those that saw a swing to Ahmadinejad
(Fig.1) all the more unusual. There is no significant correlation between the
increase in participation for a given province and the swing to Ahmadinejad
(Fig.1). This lack of correlation makes the argument that an increase in
participation by a previously silent conservative majority won the election for
Ahmadinejad somewhat problematic.
Furthermore, there are concerns about the numbers themselves. Two
provinces, Mazandaran and Yazd, have results which indicate that more votes
were cast on 12 June than there were eligible voters and that four more
 provinces had turnouts in the mid-nineties.
 In a country where allegations of 'tombstone voting' — the practice200f using the
 identity documents of the deceased to cast additional ballots — are both longstanding
 and widespread, this result is troubling but perhaps not unexpected.
 This problem did not start with Ahmadinejad; according to official statistics
 gathered by the International institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance
 in Stockholm, there were 12.9% more registered voters at the time of
 Mohammed Khatami's 2001 victory than there were citizens of voting age.
 In conclusion, a number of aspects of the reported turnout figures are
 problematic. The massive increases from 2005, the collapse of regional
 variations, and the absence of any clear correlation between increases in
 turnout and increased support for any candidate on their own make the results
  problematic.

2. Where did Ahmadinejad's New Votes Come From?
According to the official Ministry of Interior voting data (see Appendix),
Mahmud Ahmadinejad has increased the conservative vote by 113%
compared to the 2005 election. There is little correlation in provincial level
results between the increase in turnout and the swing to the President,
challenging the notion that a previously silent conservative majority has come
out to support him. Interestingly, in 1.0 out of 30 provinces, mainly former
Mehdi Karrubi strongholds, the official data suggests that Ahmadinejad
received not only the votes of all former non-voters and former Rafsanjani
voters, but also took up to 44% of the vote from those who had previously
voted Reformist.
According to the official data1, Mahmud Ahmadinejad has received
approximately 13m more votes in this election than the combined conservative
vote in the 2005 Presidential election2.
Assuming that Ahmadinejad retained all 11.5m Conservative votes from 2005,
these additional 13m votes could have come from three sources, in
descending order of likelihood:
• The approximately 10.6m citizens who did not vote in 2005, but chose
to vote in this election
• The 6.2m citizens who voted for the centrist Rafsanjani in 2005
• The 10.4m citizens who voted for Reformist candidates in 2005
In order to examine in detail where Ahmadinejad's increased support came
from, the table below (Fig.3) shows the composition of the 2009 vote by
province, dividing it into those who voted Conservative, Rafsanjani, and
Reformist in 2005, and those who did not vote at all in 2005. It assumes that
2005 voters will vote again.
The table demonstrates that in the 10 of Iran's 30 provinces highlighted red, in
order for the official statistics to be correct Ahmadinejad would have needed to
win over all new voters, all former Rafsanjani voters, and also up to 44% of
former reformist voters.
1 Serious complaints have been raised about both the 2005 elections and the 2009
elections. Government data is not perfectly reliable.
2 In 2005 there were three Conservative candidates in the first round. Ahmadinejad can
reasonably be expected to have received in 2009, all votes cast for Conservatives in
2005. Here, Ahmadinejad's 2009 performance is compared to the combined
performance of all three Conservatives in 2005.
Preliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran's 2009 Presidential Election
www.chathamhouse.org.uk 6
It is notable that many of these are provinces where the Reformist cleric Mehdi
Karrubi polled highly in 2005, and the government's figures would appear to
suggest that his former supporters have not voted tactically for the likely
Reformist challenger Mir Hussein Musavi, as many had expected, but rather
that they have defected to the hard-line conservative incumbent Ahmadinejad.
This interpretation is to some extent supported by the relationship between the
percentage of former Karrubi voters in a province, and its swing to
Ahmadinejad (Fig.2).
To many Reformists, this situation is extremely unlikely. Mehdi Karrubi is a
well-known reformist, of polar opposite views to Ahmadinejad on issues of
political and cultural freedoms, economic management, and foreign policy.
They allege fraud, and it is likely that the provinces where Karrubi's vote has
 collapsed will provide the bulk of the 600+ complaints which the defeated
 c andidates are lodging against the conduct of the election.

However, Karrubi, like Ahmadinejad, is seen as a 'man of the people', and
Ahmadinejad is as much a re-incarnation of the Islamic Republic's early hard
left as he is a leader of its current hard-right. Ahmadinejad's supporters thus
claim that rural voters voted for Ahmadinejad in 2009 for precisely the same
reasons that they voted for Karrubi in 2005.
The data offers no arbitration in this dispute, although Roukema's application
of statistical fraud detection techniques to the 'by district' data has turned up
some anomalies with respect to the figures for Karrubi's vote,3 which may
suggest that they were created by a computer. These can be followed up
should the fully disaggregated 'by polling station' data be released during the
ongoing dispute.

3. Do Rural Voters Support Ahmadinejad?
Many commentators have suggested, before and after the Presidential
Election, that Ahmadinejad is very popular in rural areas and that this explains
his high levels of support. However, the data from the 2005 Presidential
election does not support this contention. Instead, it confirms that what
support Ahmadinejad did gain in 2005 was mainly from urban and suburban
areas. The graphs below show the levels of support for Ahmadinejad against
the rural population of the province in question (Fig.4) and Conservatives as a
group (Fig.5).

 2006 (see appendix)
 This data supports the con tention of academic experts on rural Iranian politics4
 that rural voters have not been the dedicated Ahmadinejad supporters
 occasionally described in western media. This is supported by the fact that
 much of Iran's rural population is comprised of ethnic minorities: Lors, Baluch,
•Kurdish, and Arab amongst others. These ethnic minorities have a history both
 of voting Reformist and of voting for members of their own ethnic group. For

example, they were an important segment of Khatami's vote in 1997 and 2001
and voted largely for Karrubi and Mostafa Moin in 2005.
The 2009 data suggests a sudden shift in political support with precisely these
rural provinces, which had not previously supported Ahmadinejad or any other
conservative (Fig.5) showing substantial swings to Ahmadinejad (Fig.6). At the
same time, the official data suggests that the vote for Mehdi Karrubi, who was
extremely popular in these rural, ethnic minority areas in 2005, has collapsed
entirely even in his home province of Lorestan, where his vote has gone from
440,247 (55.5%) in 2005 to just 44,036 (4.6%) in 2009. This is paralleled by
an overall swing of 50.9% to Ahmadinejad, with official results suggesting that
he has captured the support of 47.5% of those who cast their ballots for

Reformist candidates in 2005. This, more than any other result, is highly
implausible, and has been the subject of much debate in Iran.
This increase in support for Ahmadinejad amongst rural and ethnic minoritiy
voters is out of step with previous trends, extremely large in scale, and central
to the question of why (or indeed whether) he won in June 2009.
