Hi Hillary, you are doing an amazing job as our Secretary of State and we are all immensely proud of you.

Really enjoyed your recent remarks regarding Afghanistan. Your words were spot on. Fyi, I will be in Kabul, Afghanistan
from 7 thru 14 April and am being hosted by Flamed Wardak, the son of the Afghanistan Secretary of Defense. Looking
forward to the visit.

There is some exciting personal news that I wanted to share with you. Although it has not yet been announced, I wanted
you to know that I recently interviewed with Cisco President ( John Chambers) and accepted a senior executive position
( effective 4 May ) to be the face and thought leader for Cisco in the field of "Intelligent Urbanization" with my focus
area being on Physical Safety and Security.

My wife (Faith) and I will live in Bangalore, India ( we are very excited ) and my area of responsibility will be the
emerging markets of Asia, Middle East and Africa . Since I will operate from India that particular country will be a major
focal point.

The use of the Network to improve the quality of life of Millions of people in areas such as Education, Health Care and
Security will be a major thrust of " Intelligent Urbanization". Faith and I are pumped up about our new overseas
adventure and the chance to work for a world class company and a superb business leader like John Chambers.

It is really a wonderful opportunity to positively impact many lives around the Globe.

Hope to perhaps call on you for a few minutes before I head over to India.

All the best and God Bless.
Sincerely, Dave

                                                            21
