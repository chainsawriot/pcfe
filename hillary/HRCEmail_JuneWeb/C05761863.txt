Subject: today's meeting with Roxanne Saberi

Just FYI: wanted you all to know that, for S's meeting today with Roxanne Saberi, I deferred on my own
participation in favor of the officer in the Iran office who has been doggedly working on this case for
months. Erica Thibault                                                                    has been working all   B6
out to get messages via the Swiss and others, working with CA and the family, etc. on this case. So if S was
wondering why I wasn't showing up, it was as a moral boost and recognition of the work Erica did on this case.
