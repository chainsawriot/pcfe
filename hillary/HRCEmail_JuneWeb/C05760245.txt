Yes, we're trying to find a date that works for Les, but he is a little, shall we say picky.

Pls see below and scheduling options requested. Is this a cover story? Does anyone know? By the way, this Sunday's
story about Barbra was fabulous.

H,
I spent yesterday with Les Gelb on Nantucket. He had lots to say which might be of interest, but I thought the most
important thing to tell you is to make sure you are aware of the Parade magazine piece he wants to do about you. He
would like to do a day in your life, when you meet with members of Congress and international figures. He wants to
show the impact you are having domestically and internationally. He said he would give you a veto over content and
looked me in the eye and said, "she will like it". Maybe you know this, but did not want it to fall between the cracks.
Enjoy your vacation and love to all of you.
Xoxo
