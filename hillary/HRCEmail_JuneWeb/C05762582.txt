Bill Clinton raising bucks for Maloney
Former President Clinton will be keeping his commitment to host a fundraiser for Rep. Carolyn Maloney, who
has irritated other Democratic leaders by announcing she*s challenging Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) in a
primary.

The July 20 fundraiser with Clinton*in Manhattan had been in the works for months, well before Maloney
announced she would be running against Gillibrand. The former president has not endorsed in the race for his
wife*s former Senate seat and is not planning to issue an endorsement, according to his spokesman.

Clinton held a fundraiser for Gillibrand in March soon after she was appointed to the Senate by Gov. David
Paterson (D-N.Y).

The fundraiser is for Maloney*s House fund but in practical terms, the fundraiser has the same effect as raising
money for a Senate campaign. Maloney is allowed to transfer unlimited sums from her House campaign
account to any future Senate account, according to FEC law.

Clinton spokesman Matt McKenna said the fundraiser is part of a series of events where the former president is
helping out elected officials who supported his wife*s 2008 presidential campaign.

*We agreed to do this event some time ago, as a way of saying thank you for the congresswoman*s hard
work on behalf of then-Sen. Clinton in the presidential campaign* said McKenna.

But Clinton is steering clear from helping another Hillary-supporting House Democrat who is also challenging a
sitting senator in a primary. POLITICO reported last month that Clinton wont be holding any fundraisers for
Rep. Joe Sestak (D-Pa.), a Clinton pal who is running against Sen. Arlen Specter (D-Pa.).

Specter has been endorsed by President Obama, Vice President Biden and Gov. Ed Rendell (D-Pa.), who was
also one of Hillary*s most dedicated supporters in 2008.
