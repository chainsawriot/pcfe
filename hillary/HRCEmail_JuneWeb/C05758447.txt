Pls follow up. They could come by the Dept. which seems like the only time it would work.

I received call today from Bishop Schol and David Young.... The worlwild Conference of Catholic Bishops are in town and
they're seeking an audience... Very late notice I told them BUT they have about a hundred here from all over the globe
and they are our Methodists... I had the Bishop send me the details and I contact number. Attached below. I left it very
vague and told them you may not even be town and how extremely busy you are...

Dear Burns,




It was good to talk with you again this morning. I am grateful for your willingness to help the Council of Bishops. The
following are dates and times that are available:




Sunday, May 3, 6:00 PM dinner - This is the opening dinner for the Council in which all of the bishops will be present. It
will be at the American University Katzman Arts Center (right on the Nebraska Circle).




Wednesday, May 6, 6:00 PM dinner - Again all of the bishops will be present. This dinner will be at the Bethesda Hyatt,
7400 Wisconsin Avenue.

Another option is on Tuesday, May 6, any time between 2:00 and 4 PM with a group of bishops who are available to
come to the State Department.




Also a group of bishops are available for breakfast or lunch Tuesday through Thursday.




Our first hope is either the Sunday or Wednesday for dinner.




You or someone on behalf of Secretary Clinton can call me at                  If you could call or email me today to let me
know how the initial call went.




Keep the faith!




John R. Schol, Bishop

The United Methodist Church

John and Burns, Great talking to you both this evening.




Burns, the United Methodist Bishops from around the world are coming to the Washington area for a weeklong
gathering of bishops. Bishop John is host and arranging their schedule. John can tell you more details ...
it would be wonderful if a time could be found sometime during the week
(Sunday-Friday) for Hillary to meet with the entire group of bishops (around 100 total) or at least the leaders of the
African bishops (perhaps a group of 10 or so).

John notes that the group can be flexible and accomodate Hillary's busy schedule. He suggests that there are a couple
of ideal evening opportunities where all the bishops will be present: this Sunday evening at 6 pm at American
University's Arts Center, or Wednesday at 6 pm at the Hyatt in Bethesda. There also is a Tuesday evening gathering and
reception with just the African bishops -- 7 pm onwards at AP Shaw UMC in SE DC.




If it is not possible for her to go to the bishops, I wonder whether it might be possible for a smaller group (eg, John, the
African bishops and a couple others) to come to the State Department for a meeting in the Secretary's suite or
conference room on the 7th floor. The Secretary obviously has a very busy schedule, but it might well be possible to find
20-30 minutes sometime during the week at the Department. (I haven't yet done so, but I will check the State Dept
website and see what her announced travel schedule is.)




I am happy to help however I can, though it probably is easiest if you coordinate directly. Feel free to copy me at the
above emails if I can be helpful. Here are your cell numbers: Bishop John's is
Burns's is




God's blessings to you both,


David
