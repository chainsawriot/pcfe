Please pass this message to Secretary Clinton.

Thank you so much for your support for the GLT community. This is the first time in my 24.5 year
career that I have seen this type of support. I appreciate all the hard work you have done in the short
time as Secretary of State.

You have given so much hope to so many. I am so proud of you and your work.
