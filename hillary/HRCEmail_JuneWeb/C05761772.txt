Cheryl - Thank you so much for considering this invitation. I am sure the sponsors would be absolutely thrilled to have
Secretary Clinton appear.

In passing let me say what an extraordinary job you are all doing. As an American citizen it gives me great confidence
and pride to see Secretary Clinton representing our country with such skill and grace. All Best, Dick

Dear Cheryl




Following a few discussions with Dick Gephardt - I have pleasure in laying out fairly detailed information about a
conference that is being held in Demark on 3-4 December 2009.




We have made the note reasonably in-depth so hopefully will provide you with sufficient background. The organisers of
the event which are ATP - the largest Danish Pension Fund and the Climate Consortium Denmark are being sponsored
and backed by the Danish government and they were very hopeful that Hillary would be able to be the key note speaker
at the conference for reasons that they have identified in the attached briefing document.




We were hoping to establish whether this event would be of interest for Hillary to appear and if she was available we
would then arrange for the formal invite to be sent out by the Danish Government.




If we can provide any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.




With very Best wishes

Nigel
