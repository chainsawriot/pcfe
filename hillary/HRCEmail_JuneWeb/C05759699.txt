meeting. Please see if the issues of Grameen Bank can be raised in a

friendly way.




I sought an appointment with the Prime Minister to brief her on our problems,

at the advice of the US ambassador in Dhaka. But it is now over six weeks,

her office never responded.




Almost every important person in Bangladesh congratulated me for receiving

the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Prime Minister and her party said not

a word about it.




So you can see the depth of the problem.




I thought I should keep you briefed and let you figure out what to be done.




Thanks for your help. Give my regards to H.




See you in CGI and Hilton event soon. Best.




Yunus
