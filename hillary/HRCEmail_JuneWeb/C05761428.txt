Answers under each:

Will I receive a full notebook for approps hearings tonight?

Yes, and a draft of the testimony.

I'd like a call this afternoon or evening to go over the draft Af-Pak regional strategy. Who should be on call? It is quite
good but lacks "milestones" and budgets for each section.

Sounds good. Huma and I will work to set it up. The budget issue is complicated -- we've had several discussions about
it. It's hard to put down numbers with confidence.

Call should be with Jack, Piper, Rich, Paul Jones, and Sean Misko.



Re the required report for Kerry-Lugar, I want to be sure that the language in both our report and this one echo the
same language.

Paul, Sean, and Rich are going back over to make sure of that. Our chief method is to use framing language from the
strategy to frame the KLB report as well.



I never called Patricia Espinosa--should I?

Will check with WHA.



Also, have we rec'd a memo from Shaun Woodard for Robinson and McGuinness calls?

Huma should have this memo for you.

There will also be a PC on Af-Pak Tuesday and I want to be sure our report is ready.

Yes -- this is consistent with our timeline.
