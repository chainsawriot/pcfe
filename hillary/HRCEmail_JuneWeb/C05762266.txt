       Was going to write earlier re Palau willingness to take the 17 Guantanamo Uighurs -- but see the
       story has now broken. I am now representing Palau, primarily re extension of free association w/
       the U.S. In touch w/Fried's office re Uighurs. Big commitment for Palau since Chinese tourism
       was planned and its close geographically, etc. but their premium is on U.S. relations (as sadly
       demonstrated by the loss of a Palauan in the U.S. Army in Afghanistan last week).

       Also, just FYI now, I've been concerned that the Budget includes a far too low placeholder for
       free association extension aid, $45-9 m over 10 years, although the aid is to be based on a joint
       review of need that will really begin with a Palauan presentation Friday. (I think the number
       didn't reflect any rethinking by this Administration). The U.S. is to respond in a month.
