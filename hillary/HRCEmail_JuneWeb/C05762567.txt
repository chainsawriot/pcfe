Tauscher Wins Plaudits From Panel, But Still Faces Hold
By Caitlin Webber, CQ Staff

California Democratic Rep. Ellen 0. Tauscher enjoyed an enthusiastic reception from the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee on Tuesday, but a senior Republican said she'll be blocked from quick floor
consideration.

Senate Minority Whip Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., said he plans to place a hold on the Tauscher nomination as soon as it
is reported out of the committee, as leverage to get information and assurances from the Obama administration
on issues including — but not limited to — nuclear reduction talks with Russia and the deployment of ballistic
missile defense.

"All I'm going to ask for is for the administration to abide by commitments that it has made, which one would
think it could easily do," said Kyl. He declined to reveal the specifics of the assurances he is seeking.

As the White House's top arms control adviser, Tauscher would be charged with pushing for ratification of the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and a follow-on to the expiring Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty (START) with Russia.

Tauscher, chairwoman of the House Armed Services Strategic Forces Subcommittee, would have to contend
with considerable push-back from Senate Republicans to implement either treaty.

Many treaty opponents argue the test-ban could undermine the U.S. capacity to deter other nations from using
nuclear weapons.

She said Tuesday that numerous advances have been made in test-ban verification procedures and ensuring the
safety of the U.S. stockpile since the Senate rejected ratification of the CTBT nearly 10 years ago.

"Stopping nuclear proliferation by protecting our stockpile, maintaining the credibility of our deterrent and
preventing terrorists from getting a hold of a weapon of mass destruction has become my life's work," she told
the panel Tuesday.

She also said she would back President Obama's diplomatic efforts to persuade the eight other non-signatories
— China, North Korea, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Israel and Egypt — to ratify the treaty. Indonesia's
foreign minister said Monday it would ratify the CTBT, which bans all nuclear explosions for any purpose,
immediately after the United States does.

Tauscher would need to tackle critics among Senate Republicans who contend the Obama administration is
rushing into an agreement on nuclear arms reduction with Russia.

At an Armed Services Strategic Forces Subcommittee hearing last week, Sens. David Vitter, R-La., and Jeff
Sessions, R-Ala., said it was imprudent for the Obama administration to agree to reduced nuclear warhead
levels with Russia before the release of the Defense Department's Nuclear Posture Review, which sets the
course of the nation's nuclear stockpile, in early 2010. Administration negotiators aim to have a renewed
agreement with Russia before the current treaty expires on Dec. 5.

Tauscher told the Senate Foreign Relations panel Tuesday that she would work to allay those concerns. "We
can multi-task. . . . I'm confident we can assure everyone . . . that what is going on in the review is informing
the negotiations."

Chairman John Kerry, D-Mass., said he would move Tauscher's nomination quickly through the committee and
would urge the full Senate to follow quickly thereafter.
