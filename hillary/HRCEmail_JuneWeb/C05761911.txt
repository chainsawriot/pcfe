With respect to our interests, it went great. They had so many witnesses (five on a single panel) that Zelikow didn't get
that much play and the memo itself even less. Zelikow mentioned in his opening statement, matter of factly, that his memo
was located and that it was undergoing declassification review.

Senator Whitehouse didn't even mention that he had read the classified memo, and Coburn was in attendance but left
before he could ask any questions.
