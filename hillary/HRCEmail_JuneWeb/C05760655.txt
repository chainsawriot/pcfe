Subject: Carter to Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil

You all may already be aware of this, but former Pres Carter is traveling to the countries in the subject line at the end of
Apr/beginning of May. His Carter Center staff has asked for unclas briefers, which we'll provide. Embassies are involved
to a greater and lesser extent, depending on Carter's desires, in arranging schedules.
