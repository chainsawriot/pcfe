Almost all of the family has gone!
Thank you so very much for a most amazing day. Your remarks were too kind and of course hysterical - I was relieved
that you chose that story - there are so many others...

Thank you for this extraordinary opportunity - again. I will do you proud. I look forward to the challenges but moreso
the fun we can have again!
From the bottom of my heart and much love - Capricia Sent via BlackBerry by AT&T
