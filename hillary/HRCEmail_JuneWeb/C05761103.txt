You should also get Bill and/or Farmer to call. Should we get any Congress Member to call? If so, who?

  Stewart,




  I went for news and indeed Guy is right. The meeting occurred yesterday and the decision was made to revoke the
  government on October 29. I wonder what happened with the initial decision which was strictly concerning Minister
  Dorsainvil and which was for November 20th or 21st.The idea had been sold that Michele should not be touched as the
  President did not care to have a vacuum in these electoral times. Plus, Michele was finally regarded as ambitionless (not
  seeking presidential powers) which is not a bad thing under the circumstances. Apparently, she, not being amenable to
  sacrificing some of her Ministers...and again, she being the one to name their replacements, has brought about the
  decision to do away with her altogether. The trouble is that nobody seems willing to counter the President with whom
  the instructions have originated. It is a head to head match between the Prime Minister and the President. That is
  obviously not good. Nobody will stand against the President elect for the Prime Minister appointed.




   I will have two meetings with separate parliamentarians tomorrow. On one end the ones voting to oust her on the
   other the week opposition. The frustrating thing is that none have allegiance to her, just as none have the individual
   power to stand against the vote for which consensus is being secured.




â€¢ The UN and other international players (at least locally) after having cried victory, success and democracy are reluctant
  to openly and publically denounce the matter. After announcing a week or two ago that Haiti is the new place to invest,
  how can they say anything but whatever is done, reflects good governance.




   Frankly, I did not see this one coming. We need to think.




   In touch tomorrow for updates.
