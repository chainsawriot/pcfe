LAWMAKER EXPECTS CLINTON TO SOON FIX GAY INEQUITIES AT STATE DEPT.


On Monday I posted that Rep. Howard Berman had introduced the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2010
and 2011 (H.R. 2410) late last week, which covers a broad range of foreign policy and diplomacy issues, one of which is to
"end the long-standing practice of excluding the committed partners of Foreign Service officers from the benefits routinely
provided to the spouses and children of officers serving abroad."


q12-oday, news of developments in that area: "Berman, in a hearing on funding for the Foreign Service, said he would drop â€¢
his legislative bid as 'it is my expectation, based on very recent conversations, that the Secretary of State will move forward
with implementing all of the benefits provided in that provision in the very near future.' The congressman invited to the
hearing Michael Guest, the former US ambassador to Romania who in 2007 left the Foreign Service, citing unfair treatment of
his partner."


In February, Rep. Tammy Baldwin sent a letter co-signed by Senators Russ Feingold and Ron Wyden, and Rep. Ileana Ros-
Lehtinen to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asking that inequities be remedied. Clinton said that such remedies were "on a
fast timeline."
