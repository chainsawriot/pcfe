Dear Nora,

Please pass along the following message to Cheryl.

Thanks,

Jeff Sachs




Dear Cheryl,

Congratulations on the launch of the $20b G8 initiative. This will stand as a historic success of President Obama and
Secretary Clinton. Please do convey my personal congratulations and gratitude to Secretary Clinton if you have a
moment to do so. I know what a key role you personally played in bringing this to fruition.

I would like to suggest one overarching strategy for success.

Please do push hard on the donors (USAID included!) to pool the donor resources into one, at most two, multilateral
funding streams. Certainly the World Bank should be the main spigot, and IFAD possibly a second. By pooling the
resources, we'll cut down BY YEARS on the delays, donor negotiations, further talk, report writing, expert trips, etc., etc.,
which are now the biggest single threat to success of the initiative.

I look forward to a few minutes by phone or in person to offer some tips coming from long years of experience in this
sphere. This can be a real historic path-breaker, if it's not swallowed in the agencies!

Warm regards and kudos!

Jeff Sachs
