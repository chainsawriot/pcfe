I will work on this today. You would need specific background and potential ways forward on each of the major issues --
inscribing commitments, MRV, and funding. You would need all of the POTUS briefing materials. I will work to figure
out what else.

I'd like to see pertinent recent articles/op-eds about the negotiations and vetted proposals for breaking the deadlock
like the idea I proposed to have two levels of MRV w only one eligible for $.

And can Todd et al send comprhensive overview before I leave? Make sure there's a phone on plane we take. What
else?
