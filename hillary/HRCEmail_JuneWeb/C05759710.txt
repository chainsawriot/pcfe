Subject: (WSJ) U.S. to Shelve Nuclear Missile Shield




WASHINGTON (Wall Street Journal) - The White House will shelve Bush administration plans to build a missile-defense
system in Poland and the Czech Republic, according to people familiar with the matter, a move likely to cheer Moscow
and roil the security debate in Europe. The U.S. will base its decision on a determination that Iran's long-range missile
program has not progressed as rapidly as previously estimated, reducing the threat to the continental U.S. and major
European capitals, according to current and former U.S. officials.
