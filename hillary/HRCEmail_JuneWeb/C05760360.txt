The devil will be in the details, but I see no flags. Can you talk?

I met with Steve.

We had a good cony and discussed a number of areas of focus, most of which are 13/1.

Take a look and flag any concerns.

I am going to discuss with Jack this am.

i-ii Cheryl,

Thanks for the meeting on Friday. I am excited about the possibilities. As we discussed, here are some initial ideas on
some of the isssues I might work on. Let me know if this is more-or-less in the right direction -- I am not quite sure what
wold be most helpful. Feel free to drop, add, or otherwise change anything. Anyway, here is a first shot.

Best,
Steve
