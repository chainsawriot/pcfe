Whenever you do something big on TV we all hear from lots of folks saying you did great. But this time is noticeably
different. First, people across the spectrum - DC insiders, reporters, staff, ex-staff, friends of friends, WH folks, etc -
were blown away. Second, people were REALLY moved by the last segment, three people even told me they teared up.
I'm guessing and hoping you hear this directly from random folks in the coming days.

And I think because it's been a lousy couple of weeks for the Admin, with mixed messages and bad news, coupled with
many people seeing you for the first time for an extended period talking about the job and your relationship with the
President, and that combo was probably the most powerful reminder since your speech in Denver that you're in a class
all your own (including the President who became enmeshed in the Gates incident)

That you didn't wait for the envoy question was key, you turned it into a strength. What you said about the President
and how you said it, one can't help but think how much of a team player you are and how remarkably you've adapted to
the role.

You were definitely on your game. You either threw a perfect game - or at least a no hitter. So this couldn't have gone
better, achieved everything we needed to times 10, and comes on the heels of a great 10 days.

Will be interesting to see the storyline that emanates from this. Because there was no substantive news, it'll be a focus
on style - especially saving Biden.
