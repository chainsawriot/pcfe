Happy Halloween from Abu Dhabi! I would be happy to meet w the machinist members but I'm not sure who they are!
I'm copying Lona to ask her to call you to get details so she can follow up. I hope we can catch up soon! Lots of treats
(and no tricks!) for you and David!

Hello again,




This is the follow-up info from the IAM after Tom Buffenbarger asked me to be in touch with you about a possible visit
with their members servicing your plane(s?) Below is from Rick, who separately said such a visit need not include Tom -
- the key piece of info is that the workers cannot approach you, you'd have to reach out to them.




At Andrews AFB, IAM Local Lodge 24's President and Chief Steward is Al Nuzzo. His contact information is:



301-981-8300 (o)



Thanks for you help on this.

Rick
