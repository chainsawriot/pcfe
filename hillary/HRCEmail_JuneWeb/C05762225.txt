Subject:                       Gordon survives...



The Parliamentary Labour Party meeting is just Over. Gordon has survived. The event, held in private,
was high drama and anticlimax at once. The chair asked for rebels to come forward and speak. Only
one prominent person emerged, Charles Clarke, former Home Secretary and Blairite; the rest were a
handful of about a half-dozen backbenchers. Their remarks about how Brown was bringing the party
down were poorly received. The party, after all, was in no mood for breaking ranks and rewarding
disloyalty. With this paltry showing, the opposition petered out, at least for now. Gordon then gave a
speech, strong on analysis, discussing that his government was paying the price for getting the
country through a difficult recession, suffering from the worst parliamentary crisis since Lloyd George
and still had a program to offer. He also make the point that when the party had split int he past it was
over ideology or policy and there were no stated differences presented by the opposition. So for now,
Gordon has won. Sid
