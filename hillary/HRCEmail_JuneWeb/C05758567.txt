AMS did not like any of this both for the substance and because she did not write it so we did not share it with you
today. Then I decided to share it with you anyway for any value it has for you.




Frame:

The world we live in today is inextricably interconnected. Together we succeed. Apart we fail. In the Obama
Administration, we will use smart power to advance to our shared security, shared prosperity and shared humanity.




In advancing our shared security, we seek to:

      Reduce threat of violent extremism

      Reduce the spread of weapons of mass destruction

In advancing our shared prosperity, we seek to:

      Use development to create and sustain strong stable economies by:

o Focusing on women as essential for driving economic growth;

o Expanding access to food and the means to grow or buy it; and,

o Expanding access to quality education in developing countries;




      Expand access to stable, affordable and increasingly clean energy sources

In advancing our shared humanity, we seek to:

      Expand human rights and the conditions that promote respect for human rights

•    Support the development of health systems that support healthier societies and confront the spread of pandemic
disease (e.g., AIDs)

How we achieve these goals:

We will advance these goals through shared responsibility and the application of smart power. America has the
responsibility to lead, but can only lead in partnership with others. Smart power means elevating and integrating
diplomacy and development.




DIPLOMACY:




Focus on priority partnerships:

     Revitalized partnerships with historic allies EU, Japan, Korea, Australia;

     Calibrated partnerships with China and Russia;

     Cultivated partnerships: Brazil, India, Turkey, Indonesia, and South Africa;

•    Targeted public/private and multilateral partnerships based upon the principles of variable geometry (i.e., focused
on the problem at hand).

Build strong partnerships by:

     listening and mutual respect — which has begun already and will continue

     being accountable for the challenges we create and demanding that our partners are similarly accountable;

•    focusing on government to people, and people to people connections using new technology to create buy in from
bottom up so shared responsibility is experienced on the ground and sustainable;

•    eliminating the obstacles to cooperation that stand in the way of us achieve our goals (e.g., resolving Cyprus so
Turkey can enter the EU; engaging Iran to create greater accountability among EU partners if engagement fails)

    creating work plans to drive cooperation on our shared agenda: tasks, timetables and benchmarks for each
country

DEVELOPMENT:




Establish and implement against our critical priorities:




     Women as economic drivers and social stabilizers;

     Education as the gateway to economic opportunity and human rights;
