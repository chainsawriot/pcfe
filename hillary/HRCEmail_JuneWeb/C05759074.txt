         Secretary Clinton -- You were phenomenol this morning on Meet the Press. Many NY friends and fans have
been emailing me today with rave reviews, even some of my new Republican pals. I missed you at the UN Eleanor
Roosevelt breakfast - you were mobbed. I will be in Washington on Thursday for Andrew Shapiro's swearing-in, perhaps
I will see you there. Thanks for the note to Jessica for her graduation -- she's doing great -- a counselor in training at a
local day camp and (yikes) High School this fall. Some sad news to report                                                      B6
