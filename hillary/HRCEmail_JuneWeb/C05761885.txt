Given your meeting in March with NGOs working on human rights in China, I thought you might be interested in this very
positive reaction from Human Rights Watch on the Secretary's Tiananmen statement.

Subject: Tiananmen statement

Susan, Susan,

Many thanks for the Tiananmen statement, which hit all they key points, and went a long way towards resolving any lingering
ambiguity from the Secretary's February comments. We believe it remains crucial to make such statements every year-or until such
time as the Chinese government allows for real resolution. We know these statements cause a certain amoint of diplomatic rancor, but
we hope that the comfort and courage they give people also remain part of your calculations.

May I trouble one of you to forward this message to Steve and Dan in Beijing, and to Carlos in DC? And please do feel free to share it
with anyone else involved in the statement.

Cheers,

Sophie
