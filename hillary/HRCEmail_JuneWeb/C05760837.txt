Madam Secretary,

Thanks again. n1 send the Princeton speech text to Jake. On Libya, I did talk to New York -- the Libyans did
not object to our text in the end, and we're on track for adoption of statement this afternoon. All best, Bill

Ifs a pleasure working w you and I'm both delighted and honored to call you a colleague. I also would like to
read your Princeton speech which the article referenced.

In addition, I'd welcome your ideas about how best to identify and promote the next generation of "Bill Burns
FS0s".
That is one of my reform goals.

On another matter, we are in good shape at the UN on the DPRK Pres. Statement
except for the Libyans. Would you pls contact Susan Rice to get briefed and advise what we should do to get
them on board. Thx. H

Madam Secretary,

Many thanks for the very generous comments you made to The Washington Times about me. The whole article
was much more than I deserved (or wanted), but what you said really means a lot. It's an honor to work for you.

Hope you're having a great Easter holiday,

Bill
