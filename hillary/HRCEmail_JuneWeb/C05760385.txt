Madam Secretary,

I'm really sorry to disturb your weekend.                                                                                  1.4(D)
                                                                                                                           B1




                                                                             Jim and I agree that it would be very         1.4(D)
helpful if you could call FM Yang as soon as possible this weekend and press the point with him. If you're able to, here   B1
are a few suggested points.

Begin points:
