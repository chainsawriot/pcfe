Subject: Kudos and thanks to the Secretary

Thirty years I am a FSO and for the first time I feel really really proud to be part of a Secretary's team. Examples

1, Bringing back Farah Pandith. When she left with the change of administration I thought what a waste and figured
there was no chance a Democrat would bring back someone form a Republic administration. But you did!

2, The respect for the input of career officers by the Secretary and the U/Ses is just amazing. It will really help improve
our foreign relations.

3. The Secretary's understanding of the little things and their importance, such as holiday statements.

Well, there are more but we are under staffed and have to get back to work.

Many thanks to you all for being there.
