Here is what we have come up with as agreed language from Bob, Eric, Mike, Melanne, Lissa and me. This can be used
for the letter and for press guidance. Melanne will send a letter to the GOSL and perhaps the UN Permrep. We will ask
the Post to release the letter to journalists in Colombo once it is received. I will schedule a press briefing at the Foreign
Press Center early this week, which will attract a good number of Asian journalists, and make sure the question is asked
so we can put it in proper context. We will have it for guidance in the Main State briefing if asked. PJ

BEGIN TEXT

Questions have been raised regarding remarks by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on September 30 before the United
Nations Security Council on the adoption of a resolution to combat sexual violence in armed conflict. In her statement,
she said that we have seen rape used as a tactic before in a number of countries, including Sri Lanka.

Regarding the Secretary's reference to Sri Lanka in her address, we want to be clear. Over the course of the difficult
conflict between the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), stretching into this
decade, the State Department as well as credible human rights organizations reported numerous cases of rape and
sexual violence in Sri Lanka, particularly acts committed against women held in detention by the government. This was
the basis for the Secretary's statement. At the same time, in the most recent phase of the conflict, from 2006 to 2009,
though we remained deeply concerned about reports of extrajudicial killings, disappearances and mistreatment of
detainees, we have not received reports that rape and sexual abuse were used as tools of war, as they clearly have in
other conflict areas around the world. We hope that this clarification puts the issue in its proper context.

These questions should not detract from the specific actions that Sri Lanka needs to take now. With the end of the
military conflict, Secretary Clinton believes strongly that Sri Lanka must focus to the future and move forward on the
promotion of peace and the protection of human rights. The government of Sri Lanka should release more than 250,000
displaced persons who are still confined in camps, and lead a process of genuine political and social reconciliation. The
United States stands ready to assist and support the people of Sri Lanka with these critical challenges.

I'm happy to have Melanne send it as letter to GOSL Ambassador and maybe UN Rep and only release to SL and related
outlets.

We are waiting for DRL to clear the language. I will call Mike and/or Karen now. Everyone else is comfortable. Then we
will get it to you and put it out in Melanne's voice. You'll have something very soon.

I like the idea of it being issued by someone else but I still want to see it. Let's close this out.
