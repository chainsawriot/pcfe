Hilary,
You may know but for the last four years I have been working with the Qatari's and in particular with             on
        ssues in Qatar and I have built up a good relationship with them
                has approached me privately saying they are keen to get their relationship with the USA onto a more
positive footing and she was hoping for a "women to women" one to one private meeting with you. She is happy to
come to Washington if you could make some time available.
Is this something you would be prepared o do.                 is someone who has real influence in Qatar and she has
made a lot of difference already with her              and with the                                              in
which I am involved as the                                            I am sure the conversation would not be
confined to these issues but would be about the US/Qatar relationship generally.

Cherie Blair
