Dear Hillary,
I too am sorry not to be able to see you this time. I am currently making about one trip a month to DC for Symbion, so I
am sure there will be an opportunity in the near future. I hesitate to pester you personally so if there is somebody I can
work through to coordinate a time please let me know or have them drop me a note. My schedule is much more flexible
than yours.

By the way I just returned from Angola. Your stop there was a big hit. I found Luanda to be fascinating and much
different from much of Africa. I also found the women to be much more overtly powerful in their own right and not
exercising that power through their husbands. How refreshing. Valerie speaks to Women's Voices tonight and in.
prepping has been reading "Half the Sky" which reinforces everything you and Melanne have been fighting for for years.
When I gave my ambassadorial farewell address in Gabon in 1995 I made a point of saying that if I were the God of
development assistance I would do only one thing: give all the money to the women and then sit back and watch them
drive African economies forward. I hope you succeed in pushing the world in that direction. I don't know of a more
forceful and qualified advocate.

Joe

 Sid sent me your email about your visit next week to DC. I'm in Singapore now and will visit Manila, Shanghai, and
Beijing this week and next so will not be back while you're in DC.

  Sorry to miss you, and hope you'll let me know when you will next be there. All the best to you and Valerie (and the
twins two!) HRC
