The WH just issued the below because the Biden story (based on interview with Peter Spiegel, WSJ, on way home from
Tblisi) gained momentum throughout the day

From Robert Gibbs:

"The President said in Moscow that the United States seeks a strong, peaceful and prosperous Russia - one that will be
an even more effective partner in meeting common challenges, including reducing nuclear arsenals, securing vulnerable
nuclear materials, contending with nuclear programs in North Korea and Iran, defeating violent extremism, and
advancing global security and economic growth.

Working together to advance security and prosperity for the American and Russian people is the focus of our effort to
reset relations. The President and Vice President believe Russia will work with us not out of weakness but out of
national interest."
