Dear Secretary Clinton,

Welcome back, and I hope that your proposals on universal NATO ROE's for piracy are moving ahead. I just wanted to
let you know that I will be testfying at a hearing of the US-China Commission on Chinese foreign-directed information
operations on 30 April, and also participating in a symposium at Harvard on Iran and Afghanistan later that day, so I will
let you know if anything of interest comes out of those events.

I remain intrigued by your suggestion that I speak with Michelle Flournoy. Should I reach out to her, or wait for her to
be in touch?

Many thanks, as ever.

Yours, Jackie
