Subject:                            women finally win in Kuwait!


4 women were elected to be members of parliament for the first time. As you remember (because you were an eloquent
voice for them), women finally won the right to vote and stand for office in 2005, but failed to win seats in the two previous
election cycles.
You know some of the women who won, including Rola Dashti, who was one of the women who got the Vital Voices
award and had been part of the long-time struggle.
I told Lissa. You might want to mention in your Barnard speech.
