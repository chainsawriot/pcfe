DPRK/CHINA BORDER DETENTIONS UPDATE #47

-- May 21, 2009 --

CONSULAR ACTIVITY

Nothing to report. (CA/OCS)

DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITY

Nothing to report. (EAP/K)

MEDIA ACTIVITY

(SBU) Governor Richardson Interviewed on MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show: Richardson discussed his previous
humanitarian missions to the DPRK to retrieve detained Amcits as well as the current case. He praised the
Administration's handling of the situation so far. In particular, he said that the Secretary had been doing a good job of
emphasizing quiet diplomacy as the way to resolve the matter. Maddow made two inaccurate statements in the
introduction to the segment: 1) that the DPRK has only allowed one consular visit so far; 2) that indictment was
particularly concerning because none of the previous cases had ever gone to court. Richardson corrected the latter
inaccuracy. (EAP/K)
