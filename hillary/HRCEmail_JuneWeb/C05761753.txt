  Subject: Request to see the Secretary, the Deputies and Undersecretary Burns

 As most of you know, this will be my last week as Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asia. After three years in this
 job and an able successor about to have his hearing, I'm glad to move on. Before I slip out, I would like to stop by and
 exchange a few thoughts with the Principals. These can be short chats, a few words and a goodbye handshake.

 I'm in the office all this week, and will be back with more time the week of May 26-29 to clean up and check out. Dona
 Richard, my OMS, can fix the times.

 Thanks for your help in setting some meetings up for me, if there is time on your bosses' schedules.

 Richard
