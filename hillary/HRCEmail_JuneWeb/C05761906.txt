   Response:

   James Kunder, Senior Fellow at the German Marshall Fund and
   former Acting Deputy Administrator, U.S. Agency for International
   Development

   The United States is the largest national donor of foreign aid in the
   world. It is engaged in two major wars, each of which require
   improving local economic conditions to achieve success. And it
   faces a variety of challenges around the world—from responding to
   natural disasters to promoting democratic governance—that demand
   effective responses.

   Despite these circumstances, the United States does not have a
   comprehensive, coherent strategy to guide its development assistance
   programs. With the advent of a new administration, the time is ripe
   to have a serious policy discussion about the merits of a National
   Strategy for Global Development.

   The Sustainable Security Program at the Center for American
   Progress has written a National Strategy for Global Development,
   which it hopes will spark debate. The authors of the document, Dr.
   Reuben E. Brigety, II and Sabina Dewan, will discuss their proposal
   for an NSGD at this event. They will be joined by Mr. James
   Kunder, senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund and former
   acting deputy administrator of the U.S. Agency for International
   Development.

   May 19, 2009, 10:00am – 11:30am

   Space is extremely limited. RSVP required.
