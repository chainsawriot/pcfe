Chuck schumer called me cause he's been playing phone tag with hrc. He wanted to talk to her about the problem the
bank of ny is having in russia. He didn't realize she wasn't going. When I told him she wasn't, he said he wanted to talk to
Bill and ask you to raise this issue with russian officials. Bill, are you able to call him and I will tell hrc you are calling
back? Cell is                  or ops can reach him.
