Hrc's message so far has been brilliant. She has shaken up the status quo
with her blunt comments on drugs. She is building valuable capital with
Mexicans. In a future visit she must challenge Mexicans, especially
students, to help strenghthen their instititutions. She can commit to stand
with them as they do so by lending a helpful hand
