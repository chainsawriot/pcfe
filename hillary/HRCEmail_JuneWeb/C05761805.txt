Ladies,

One of HRC's most committed and passionate supporters,                  is retiring. Although she will be at SEIU until the
end of the month, her party is today. I know it would mean the world to her to get a message from HRC.

        an be reached at

A phone call would be great. If you prefer snail mail, let me know and I will get her home address.

You should also know that     is very interested in serving on a task force or other position where she can help advance
women's issues and otherwise help HRC.

Thanks,
Kelly
