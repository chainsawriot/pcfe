Hope you are doing well after your surgery today. So sorry you have to deal with this. A couple items:

- Tom Donohue reports that he called Inouye today and he listened, asked O's but did not commit

- I don't want to get overconfident but we had a very good week on the Expo. Pepsi at $5M, Microsoft at $1M, Corning
at $500K (privately).

- Great mtg today at GE with about 20 corporations. 15 said they would look at it seriously. I think this has turned
around. Spoke to Ginsberg, Sosnik (NBA), Mantz and they are engaged.
Get well.

Kris
