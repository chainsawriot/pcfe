Heads up -- A friend just sent this to me. Does anyone have any intel? This is a huge step and kudos to Sec. Clinton for
expending the political capital to be the first federal agency to do this!

FYI. Berman just spoke about it.

• Enact two items sought by the Foreign Service: elimination of a rule that inadvertently reduces the pay of officers
serving overseas by as much as 20 percent, and extension to same-sex partners of the benefits given to spouses and
their families, such as access to U.S. health care and moving expenses. This last provision is likely to provoke GOP
objections.

I don't have the source my friend used, but hopefully some of you might. If this is true (which I hope it is), we have to
start gearing up for the battle to support her now!

Yours in the struggle for equality,
