I will double check with the person who sends the actual tweets, but I have been really clear that the tweets should not be
in her name (unless of course she signs off on something down the road)

But we should not be twittering in the Secretary's name since she is not the person actually twittering.

There is a reference in Newsweek to her twittering and says: Hillary Clinton Style: Dry info and offers 4,788 followers

Can you advise who is twittering in her name and how we can address?

Thanks.
