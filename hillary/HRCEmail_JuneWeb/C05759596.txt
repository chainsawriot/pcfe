         BusinessWeek Ranks Department of State #5 Best Place to Launch a Career: The Department ranked at the top
among federal agencies and #5 among all employers as one of the best places to begin a career. With an increase from
#12 last year to #5 this year, BusinessWeek ranked the Department in the Top 20 for the fourth consecutive year. The
ranking is based on a three-part methodology that includes combined survey data from careers services directors,
undergraduate students, and employers. For further information, please visit

        FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE




        DELOITTE & TOUCHE TOPS BUSINESSWEEK'S ANNUAL LIST OF

        "BEST PLACES TO LAUNCH A CAREER"




        New York, New York, September 3, 2009— The big four accounting firms once again dominate BusinessWeek's
fourth annual ranking of the "Best Places to Launch a Career." Deloitte & Touche jumped to the No.1 spot, unseating
Ernst & Young who ranked No.2. PricewaterhouseCoopers and KPMG took the third and fourth spot, respectively.

        With rich benefits, extensive training programs, and a combined recruiting effort that makes more than 10,000
hires even in a tough year, the Big Four are hard to beat, and Deloitte is harder than most. With substantially higher
pay-18% of Deloitte's entry-level hires this year will earn north of $65,000—plus the industry's biggest signing bonuses
and most generous time-off policy, it's no wonder Deloitte is a favorite of students and career services directors. It
doesn't hurt that Deloitte's entry-level hiring took the smallest hit this year, down just 1.1% in the first half compared
with double-digit drops for No.2 Ernst & Young and No.4 KPMG.




        To compile this ranking, BusinessWeek polled 60 college career services directors across the country; collected
data from a survey of 60,000 U.S. undergrads by Universum USA, a Philadelphia research company; and required
employers to submit statistics on everything from pay and benefits to training programs and retention. The number of
ranked employers is down sharply this year, owing to our decision to raise the bar on eligibility. And the tougher
competition—combined with a handful of new employers and shifts in sentiment among students and career services
directors—resulted in a shakeup in the standings.




         Some companies, including No.11 Accenture and No.19 Prudential moved up more than 35 spots, while No.34
Marriott and No.48 Lockheed Martin were down 28 and 40 spots, respectively. Even the top 10 underwent big changes
this year. Marriott and Lockheed were out, as was Google, which declined to participate. But three new employers
entered the winner's circle. The State Dept. and Teach For America, which places college grads in troubled school
districts, are both in the midst of ramped-up recruiting campaigns, while J.P. Morgan, a unit ofJPMorgan Chase, reaped
a survivor's benefit: It's one of the few big investment banks left standing.




       BusinessWeek's "Best Places to Launch a Career" ranking is in the September 14, 2009 issue, on newsstands
September 4th. Expanded content is available on BusinessWeek.com, including the full methodology, profiles of each
employer, an interactive table, slide shows, and a video roundtable with recruiters.
