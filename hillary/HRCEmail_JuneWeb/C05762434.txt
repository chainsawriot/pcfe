Hi Cheryl. You may not remember me, but we were at Stanford together. I saw a statement from you on
CNN.com regarding Secretary Clinton's fractured elbow, so I went to our global address list, and voila—there
you are! You were a year or two ahead of me (I was class of 1991), but I distinctly remember being in Crim
Pro with you when the inimitable Barbara Babcock talked about your "friend" Wynton Marsalis being stopped
by the police!

Congratulations on your current position. You are really doing Stanford proud—I was watching the Clinton
impeachment hearings with friends when you were testifying and shouted, "Oh my God—I went to law school
with her!"

I can't tell you how thrilled we in the field are to have an administration we can be proud of again (I came in
during Bill Clinton's presidency, and it has been a rough eight years). As you may be learning, Foreign Service
Officers are overwhelmingly liberal democrats. At my post of 20 American officers, there are only two avowed
republicans (although there may be a few closet cases). We all watched the election returns together, and we
cheered, cried and hugged when Mr. Obama was announced the winner. Obviously, we are also thrilled to
have Hillary as our new Secretary of State.

I tried to write Secretary Clinton a message when she first announced benefits for same-sex partners
expressing my extreme gratitude. I have been with my partner for the last 14 years, and he has basically given
up his career to follow me around the world. It has been challenging but we've managed to survive. Below is
my original message, which I doubt Secretary Clinton ever actually received:

Subject:       Partner Benefits - A personal thank you from the field

I'm not sure whether this message will ever find its way to Secretary Clinton, but I would like to convey my deep gratitude
for her courage in extending benefits to same-sex partners of Foreign Service Officers. I would also like to share how her
decision has literally changed the course of my career.

I had decided long ago to retire in 2014 after twenty years of service. I love my job as a Management Officer, but my
partner and I had grown tired of struggling with a bureaucracy that essentially denied his existence. I had planned to
                                                                        lc

follow his career as an academic, where I could be officially recognized as his partner and receive benefits through his
employer.

The announcement that the State Department will now extend benefits to same-sex partners has made us re-evaluate our
future plans. After several long discussions over the past few days, we have decided that I will stay in the Foreign Service
indefinitely and my partner will follow me, finding teaching jobs wherever I am posted. This is not only about the benefits
themselves, which are of course most welcome. It is also the fact that my partner, who has been officially invisible all of
these years, is now recognized and respected as an equal member of the Foreign Service family.

I have much more to contribute to the Service, and I look forward to a long and successful career with my partner at my
side. Once again, my heartfelt thanks to Secretary Clinton for making our dream a reality.

Best regards,
                                                                                                                     B6




If you ever have the chance, I would very much appreciate it if you could thank Secretary Clinton on my
behalf. As I said in my letter, the extension of benefits to my partner has made me decide to stay in the
Foreign Service. I don't mean to be immodest, but I'm a good officer—and the Foreign Service will get the
benefit of my talents for many years to come thanks to Secretary Clinton!

Again, congratulations on your illustrious career.

Regards,




                                                     16
