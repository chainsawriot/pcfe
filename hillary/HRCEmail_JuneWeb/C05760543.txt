I spoke w the Senator about our concerns with the legislation and told him Jim had sent a letter and Rich scheduled a
mtg w his staff for Monday to discuss changes we would like to see. He said he was open to our suggestions for tweaking
but there were now 76 cosponsors. I told him we understood but still hoped for some changes before Senate action.
