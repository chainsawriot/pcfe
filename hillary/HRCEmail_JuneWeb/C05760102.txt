Doug---

 Pakistan's government can sure use the help. I'd like you to talk w Judith McHale who is working w Holbrooke's team,
including Ashley, so.I'm copying Judith and Paul Jones, Amb Holbrooke's Deputy, so they can coordinate the followup.

 Pls let me know what the next steps are w Amb Haqqani. Thanks too for your other work on global women's issues.
Best, H

Subject: Strategic Communications for Pakistan

Hello Madame Secretary. I hope you have a productive trip to Pakistan. I wanted to let you know that Ambassador
Haqqani asked me to submit a proposal to help the Government of Pakistan strengthen its communications with the
Pakistani public.




You may recall that my firm did similar hands-on work in Lebanon. The idea is to enhance the Government's internal
capacity to raise public awareness of its accomplishments, build support for its policies, and demonstrate the benefits of
democratic governance.




With stronger communications, they'd obviously be in a better position to convey the benefits of the US-Pakistan
relationship. We've followed Pakistani media coverage of Kerry-Lugar -- with more strategic communications
management by the Government, that could have been a positive story.




(The anti-American forces have used the same messages to attack US aid packages for at least 10 years. It was easy to
see the attacks coming.)




Communications help won't solve the immediate political crisis, but it could be one useful element of a larger strategic
communications strategy.

I understand there's a strategic communications working group focused on Pakistan. Would you like me to meet with
anyone to discuss this idea? I'm told Ashley Bommer is working on it. (I don't know her).




By the way - we're making headway on our campaign for Global Women's Issues - hope to have more to report soon!

Best, Doug
