Cheryl

We are gathering info on the memo on the participation agreement which I will have up to you soon. It has taken a bit
to get the right people to answer the specific questions you asked about previous agreements.

In regard to the plan memo, we will have a more detailed plan for you tomorrow. We have been waiting for the
recommendations of the new structural group that was set up in NYC last Friday afternoon (Lanny, the Chamber of
Commerce, the Committee of 100, and others). We are getting a de-brief on their plans and new structure tomorrow.

In our calls to GE's Jeff Immelt, the Chamber, and others we learned that it would not be viable to get 20 CEO's into
Washington with such short notice. The Secretary called us in last Friday and said that she was game for doing some
additional calls which everyone in the business community thinks is a more efficient way to get this done. We are
holding a meeting on Friday with the business community (up to 75 Washington reps) and would follow it up with
individual assignments. We could still build an event with CEOs around late July Strategic Dialogue.

We will get you a more detailed plan with all of the potential events and assignments.

Kris/Elizabeth:

Not sure if I missed your email or hard copy but was looking for a plan memo on Friday for this that I wanted to share
with S.

Can you advise on status?
