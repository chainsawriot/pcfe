Thanks, Hillary. the speech turned out very, very well. Devin represented the family and sent me a rave review a while
back. I missed the plug for the book, but I thank you for that. More important, I'm glad it was of some use as you
prepare for a very important trip. I'll send you later an op-ed I'm working on about the climate/nonpro agenda with
India, pegged to your trip. Safe travels, and thanks again for letting me kibitz on your good works. S.

Strobe--I really appreciate your help on the speech, along w all of your advice. I just finished reading "Engaging India"
which is a marvelous read and sober reminder of how hard this work is. You may have heard me plug it yesterday at
CFR! So, thanks my friend, Hillary
