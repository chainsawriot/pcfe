Cheryl, we are in the Netherlands and happen to be watching the Secretary's interview with Rick Neiman. He was the
person we always used for a good interview!
She was extrordinary and I am sure well received by the Dutch.
Who knows perhaps, Prime Minister
Balkanende might extend the troops one more time!
