ALL:  Police/Military have blocked vehicle traffic to the Airport. Not allowing groups of
pedestrians to pass. Apparently they are prepared to prevent Zelaya supporters to gather
at the airport. Z supporters from outside Tegucigalpa slept at University Pedagogica in
the outskirts of the city last night where they will begin their march today. Zelaya and
his supporters have been encouraging Zelaya supporters from the interior to come into the
capital and support Zelaya's arrival. Many of these are rural poor and indigenous from
his popular strongholds in the Departments of Copan Intibuca, and Lempira. We also know
that many bus loads of Z supporters are coming in from his home province of Olancho.

Zelaya is not popular in Tegucigalpa, so the potential for confrontation is high.
