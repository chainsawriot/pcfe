Mary Landrieu asked me to attend a dinner about foster care. Do you have any details? Also she mentioned an event at
the White House about adoption and foster care. Have you heard anything about this? Can you call Landrieu's office to
follow up?

I told Kouchner I would call him on 8/31. Pls remind me.
