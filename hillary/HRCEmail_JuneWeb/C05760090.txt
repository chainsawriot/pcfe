              1P 23: BACKGROUND ON FORUM FOR THE FUTURE

       From an idea of partnership to a growing reality, the Broader Middle East
       and North Africa (BMENA) Initiative represents genuine cooperation
       between the G8 and European nations and the governments, business, and
       civil society of the region to expand opportunities and prosperity for all.

       e The leaders of the G8 industrialized nations and BMENA countries
         launched the Partnership for Progress and a Common Future a blueprint
         for how G8 and Middle Eastern countries could best work together to
         support indigenous calls for reform — at the 08 Sea Island, Georgia,
         summit in June 2004.

       O The centerpiece of BMENA is the Forum for the Future, an annual
         gathering of 08, European, and BMENA Foreign Ministers with civil
         society to discuss and advance the reform agenda.

       O The Forum for the Future provides a unique venue for BMENA civil
         society organizations to meet with their government ministers as equal
         participants. The Forum fosters constructive government-civil society
         interaction to solve complex political, economic, and social problems of
         participating countries.

       O This year's Forum will include approximately 40 civil society
         representatives who participate directly alongside governments. Civil
         society participation in the Forum has risen considerably every year since
         the first Forum in Morocco in 2004, when only five leaders participated.

       e Foreign ministers from across the BMENA region, the 08, and other
         partner countries now work with these organizations to further progress
         and development in the areas of good governance, civil society,
         economic prosperity, and education.

        e This year, civil society organizations coordinated three preparatory
          meetings involving governments of the region with a cross-section of
          civil society leaders to outline priorities and develop recommendations
          for the Forum ministerial.
