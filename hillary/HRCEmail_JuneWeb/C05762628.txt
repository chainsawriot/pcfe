I have just asked for the state of play this am as messages continued last night until lam.

The bottom line of all of them was not dissimiliar to this message from torn so forwarding this one - namely, all had been
unsuccessful in dissuading Zeleya from going today and several leaders and fm (espinoza) thought call from you might
help but Zeleya appeared in update messages to get more resolute as evening went on to return based upon readouts of
various meetings with him.

I just got off the phone with President Fernandez. His efforts to dissuade Zelaya and Company from traveling tomorrow
have not been successful. He was very worried about what would happen, and requested our help in ensuring that no
incidents take place at the airport.

I told him I shared his concern. I summarized for him our efforts to date, and told him that nascent engagement with
the armed forces and the de facto government would collapse if Zelaya tried to force the issue tomorrow. I told him of
the Cardinal's plea to Zelaya to not return. He said the Cardinal in Santo Domingo is close to the Honduran Cardinal, and
said he would reach out to him. I encouraged this. I told him that I thought the elements of a deal were on the table,
we just needed to find a way to get everyone to sit at the table and start talking. I told President Fernandez that he
could play an important role in creating a climate of confidence, and suggested that he reach out to interested parties
like Ricardo Maduro and others inside of Honduras. He said he would do so and get back to me
