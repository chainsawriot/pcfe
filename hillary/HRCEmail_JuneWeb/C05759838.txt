Terry---I often have little control over my schedule these days, but we will look closely at this and let you know. I'm
copying Lona so she can do followup. All the best.

Madam Secretary-

On March 11, 2010, I'm being presented with American Friends of the Hebrew University's Scopus Award here in
Chicago. I would be honored if you would consider delivering the keynote speech at this event. I respect that your
schedule is very busy but if this would be a possibility, please let me know. Once again, you're doing an amazing job. I
look forward to hearing from you.

All my best,
Terry
