Subject:                           update: workshop key findings


Dear Secretary Clinton,

I hope that your elbow is healing quickly. I mentioned that we were doing some work on maritime developments in the
region from the Persian Gulf to the East China Sea and Sea of Japan. Below are key findings from the report, but the
main takeaway is that the political impact of Chinese military modernization may be greater than a narrow technical
analysis of China's capabilities would suggest, and for a range of reasons, technical and political, prospects for regional
cooperation are limited, but pathways to conflict are numerous and increasing.

All best, Jackie

Key findings from the workshop include:

•       Chinese naval modernization has proceeded at rates higher than
forecast 10 years ago and has created the capability to complicate operation of US carrier battle groups within 1,000
kilometers of the Chinese coastline.

•      The Indian Ocean may in the coming decades be the operating area of
SSBNs from countries with limited experience in sustained SSBN patrols, including India, China, and possibly Pakistan.

•       Chinese maritime relations with countries along the littoral area
have continued to develop, with a new friendly relationship emerging with Sri Lanka, to complement the existing
relations with Myanmar and Pakistan. This may lead to a new form of "blue-brown water" naval operations, in which
Chinese naval forces operate far from Chinese bases, but close to the coasts of client states.

The workshop tended to the conclusion that the trends in the region were not such as to make maritime cooperation
easy. These trends
include:

        Japanese concern that Chinese dominance in the waters within 1,000
miles of Chinese territory has immediate consequences for Japan's maritime autonomy.

•       Indian suspicion of Chinese naval developments in Hainan Island,
Chinese development of port infrastructure in Pakistan and Myanmar, and the possibility of Chinese ballistic missile
submarines operating close to India.

•       Indian interest in SSBNs, plus Chinese SSBN ports in Hainan and
even, possibly, Pakistani SSBNs, all of which creates the possibility of multiple SSBN patrols in the Indian Ocean, along
with the potential for naval nuclear accidents at sea.

•        Asymmetries in levels of operational competence, and technology, in
submarines and maritime aviation, which, for example, make functional multi-national naval cooperation harder for
states that are afraid of revealing technologies or weaknesses.

•       The major role of land-based maritime warfare strike complexes in

this region, which means that war at sea always carries with it the risk of escalation to strikes on ground targets in
homeland areas.

The report also offers two scenarios under which the United States may consider engaging militarily in the region.
The first scenario, which concerns a clash between Japan and China in waters claimed by both, compels us to consider:

•        The circumstances under which the Chinese may seek to demonstrate
that their new maritime capabilities must be taken seriously and respected, and

•       What the United States would lose if it did not support the
Japanese, and then faced a world in which Japan became either a subordinate power to China or a nuclear armed state,
capable of pursuing its national interest independent of the United States.

The second scenario concerns an American naval blockade of an Iran that has tested a nuclear weapon, potentially
giving rise to an interaction between the United States and China far from the operating bases of each but close to
territory of a client of China, a "blue-brown water" clash. In this scenario, China is using its navy to show presence, and
to force the United States to ask itself whether it wants to go to war with China over a political conflict that is less than
black and white. Thinking about the options that would be left to the United States under these circumstances
underscores how Chinese naval forces may have more political impact by 2025 than a narrow assessment of their
military capabilities would suggest.

Monday, our office held a workshop for the NIC that highlighted the downsides associated with an American withdrawal
from the region. I will be providing you with our report from that event. Also, in early June, we are holding two
workshops with US policy makers (one for Democrats and one for Republicans) to illuminate how contingencies in
Pakistan might affect US-China relations. I will give you a read out on those events as well.

> Anne-Marie was in touch last evening to tell me that she had looked into the possibility of working with LTSG and
found that unfortunately her office would not be able to do so. Happily, Michele Flournoy's office is reaching out and
has asked me to participate in a wargame next week for the QDR, which I hope will help build the foundation for a
contract between her office and LTSG.
