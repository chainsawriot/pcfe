Burns--thank you for forwarding this request. I always want Tony Campolo (and Peggy) to be able to find me. I'm copying
my assistant, Lauren Jiloty, so she can give you her info for contact purposes. All the best, H

Hey Bosslady... Obviously I will always connect dots when asked/needed... But see below... I assume providing Huma's
contact info is the appropriate course of action?

I hope you are well...

Burns,




James Warren here.




I need your help. I'm trying to update my contact list . and I came to Secretary of State Clinton..




Who would give me the contact names to get to Mrs. Clinton, for Tony?

       UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05763785 Date: 06/30/2015




In the past, I had




Sen. Hillary Clinton's Office    202-224-4451 (main)

Hma Abedine                      202-224-2330

Phil                             202-224-2873

Lauren Joloty                    202-224-5723




Now with the change of location and jobs, I'm not sure who I should have, for Tony if he has me try to get a message to
her office.. I know this is a rare thing, but once in a while he would do that.




I'm just looking for a friendly name to talk to, to give me some (one of
two) names of people who if we called and said Tony Campolo . it would mean something and get the message to the
right person. to get to her. (Rare ocassion, remember that.)




Thanks,

James
