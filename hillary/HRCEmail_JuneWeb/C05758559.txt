Hillary,




The email below from Sally Osberg, President of the Skoll Foundation reminds me that right after the Skoll Forum in
Oxford, I wrote Cheryl indicating your interest in meeting with Jeff Skoll. I sent another email on this and a couple of
other meetings I think important (Jacqueline Novogratz, Acumen) but have never heard anything from her. I really do
think it would be valuable for you to meet Jeff Skoll, and to talk with Jacqueline about Pakistan, in particular, but
Acumen more generally. Perhaps I should go through the public-private partnerships office?




Re       if AID still isn't done, if he'd come in, you might consider whether he should be asked to undertake AID — he'd   B6
need a very good managerial #2 so he didn't get bogged down, but he was your first archetype of the kind of "moral
authority" and leadership you wanted, and people would certainly perceive him to have been "worth the wait".




Good luck with all you're juggling. This has to be a particularly demanding week, in a string of them.




Jan

Hi Jan,




I also write to share that I spoke with            this morning—he'd called early last week, but we finally connected
today. A real honor to be one of the folks     Is seeking out for counsel—and one I don't take lightly! As you
undoubtedly know, he's been offered a new role in the Obama administration, reporting directly to Hillary, would
oversee                                  Of course, I encouraged him to do it (as have most of his students,
and others). In our conversation, he referenced your talking to one another at the Skoll Forum, your describing the
opportunity posed by Hillary's leadership—which would open space for an alliance of visionary leaders to advance a new
development paradigm for engaging with the world.




As I thought about what I said to       drawing upon my admiration for what another great social entrepreneur, John
Gardner, contributed in his role as Lyndon Johnson's Secretary of HEW, which gave him a major hand in designing the
Great Society and ushering in that great wave of civil rights legislation—I also wondered about you: specifically, your
World Bank leadership role, and how you were able to leverage your entrepreneurial instincts and clear commitment to
seeing investments translate into on-the-ground change while navigating a very large bureaucracy.




r      xpects to be in DC by Thursday, and my gut tells me he is on his way to accepting this extraordinary challenge,
with the goal of reshaping aid policy so that it serves those the U.S. most needs as allies—those billions of women, men
and children the world over whose hearts and minds can be won if they can eat, care for and support their families, find
real reason to hope. My hope, to be perfectly clear!, is that you will be a friend to      as he navigates a system he has
challenged and finds ways to drive meaningful, sustainable change. I don't really know, but my sense is that your hand is
already at work here. I also shared with him that you were working on the possibility of Hillary's speaking at next year's
Skoll Forum; he immediately said that Hillary, he and you should go together. How amazing would that be???!!!




Finally,           connected with      ver Elizabeth Bagley's upcoming visit to the Bay Area;                 and I
will meet with her when she's out here—if you have any guidance, I'd welcome it: I'm sure you know her and have a
sense of what some possible connections might be.




Warmest,
