Dear Cheryl -- You may be aware that Reps. Frank Wolf, Chris Smith and Donald Payne are holding a press conference
today to denounce the Obama policy, or lack thereof, on Darfur. Jim chose not participate, although he will be sending a
letter of concern later this week. He asked that I pass a message (below) from him. Best -- Cindy

You should let hillary's people know that we will not participate in wolf's press conference--though we are concerned.
We love hillary and believe when she unveils global food security plan we will have somethiing concrete and meaningful
to praise. It will represent a real and positive step forward on human rights. Jim
