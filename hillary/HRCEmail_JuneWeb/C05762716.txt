I addressed this with Lippert when we last had an issue.
Our identified point of contact is Sarah Farnsworth and we talk to her regularly. I will call and find out what happened
but this meeting was confirmed. They are not telling us when things get canceled and I think we need another contact
there if sarah is too overwhelmed.

I arrived for the 10:15 mtg and was told there was no mtg. Matt said they had "released" the time. This is the second
time this has happened. What's up???
