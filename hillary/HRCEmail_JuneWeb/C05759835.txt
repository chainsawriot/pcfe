I really enjoyed my time w our friend and hope we can work together on issues including your project on people w
disabilities. I'm copying Huma who was w me so we can do follow up.

Sorry I didn't see you and had only a few minutes w Tony at the Quartet mtg.

I may be in London later this month and will let you know if that happens. All the best.
