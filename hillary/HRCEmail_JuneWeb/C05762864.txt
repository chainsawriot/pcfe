Quick note to tell you the meeting ended today after lunch and it turned out to be a very positive event. To a person, the
heads of delegation were hugely complimentary. Good, very candid — even "frank" as the diplomats say -- level of
engagement, a lot of positive feeling and trust built up, an eagerness for this group to continue engaging and — perhaps —
make some progress. Dan Reifsnyder, an OES DAS who's been here a long time, said it was best meeting of this kind he
has seen in 20 years.

Issues still damnably difficult, but a pretty palpable sense in the room that something good had happened. Hearty
congrats from the Chinese, UK, Japanese, Aussies, EU, Danes, Swedes, South Africans, etc. Mike Froman did an
excellent job as Chair (I was head of U.S. delegation), and Steve Chu and John Holdren did very useful presentations
yesterday. Heads of delegation met with President in Blue Room for a reception late yesterday afternoon, which went
over big. Mike and I met with President in Oval beforehand. Reception at Kennedy Center in evening for whole
delegations, plus people from Hill, NG0s, etc., yesterday. Sen. Kerry spoke.

We followed up with a long bilateral with China and then a private dinner with the UK. More bilats tomorrow. Next
meeting of the Forum May 25-26 in Paris.

Many thanks to HRC for kicking it off in style.
