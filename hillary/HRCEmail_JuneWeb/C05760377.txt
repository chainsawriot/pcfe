Let's make calls tomorrow. And I'd like a transcript of Karzai's CNN interview today. How's the prep going?

We could reach out in the next couple of hours or alternatively early tomorrow. The Eikenberry points sent last night,
plus Holbrooke's add'n, provide a good roadmap.




Let us know how you'd like to proceed.
