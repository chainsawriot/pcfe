This was on Paul Krugman's blog yesterday. I, for one, enjoyed it. Hope you're very well Hillary.

Ahem
Politico:

        Health care could soon go the way of the automobile, with users having no choice but to buy
        insurance coverage.

        Within four years, every American could be required to own health insurance or pay their way
        through tax penalties. The odds of such a sea change rose last week when chief Democratic and
        Republican Senate negotiators on a health care bill acknowledged that many on the Finance
        Committee considered the so-called individual mandate essential to lower insurance costs for
        those who already have coverage.



        President Barack Obama didn't embrace the individual mandate during the campaign, which
        means he would essentially start from scratch in terms of selling the idea to voters.

        The mandate was a central policy difference with Hillary Clinton, who argued that a mandate
        was the only way to achieve universal coverage. Obama disagreed, saying enough people would
        purchase insurance voluntarily if the costs could be brought down.

        Progressive policy experts widely agreed that Obama's plan would have left out about 15 million
        people. Clinton, with an assist from New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, regularly
        assailed Obama for his no-mandate position.

Actually, I don't care who gets credit, as long as we actually get universal health care.
