I've been hearing really incredible feedback on the secretary's speech. One thing that people keep saying is that this is
the first time they can recall a secretary getting "technical" on the issue. Often times leaders just tell feel good
stories. I think we really took a big step forward by laying out our vision for food security through the seven areas of
focus and how we'll work through country-led processes like CAADP. People also really like how Megan made that great
connection between Ejeta's life work and our plan going forward. Megan did a great job laying out the lab to farm to
market to table. That's exactly what we're going for and what hasn't been articulated well in the past. Let's keep the
dialogue at a high level and really challenge people on this issue in the future â€“ not just regurgitate USAID success stories
like we did during the Bush years!

Best,
Matt
