Moving everything now. You had no press anyway so all is easily done.
You won't be canceling anything, just adding things to tues, wed and thurs.

I've been working on it.
We can clear tomorrow.

We will insert schedule into the rest of the week and send you a revised line block.

If we can clear schedule tomorrow that's best but I don't want to offend the Armenians or Azeris. Can you send me what
Tues-Fri would look like if we did that? Also we have the Trilateral plus Lavrov                                             B6
