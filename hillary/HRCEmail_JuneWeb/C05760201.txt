I would like to do something for Bill and think it could be a good followup to our Dialogue. What do you all think?

Dear Hillary,

I very much hope we have a chance to spend some time with you next week for the "Sanya Initiatove" in DC with four
other American Four Stars and our Chinese counterparts. You will recall this is part of what I've been trying to do under
our "complementary engagement" program, which I briefly mentioned to you.
I understand our offices are working on the schedules, but nothing is firm yet.

Your personal involvement with this group - perhaps a small lunch - would be a very important message seen at the
highest levels of the Chinese government and the Central Military Commission.

I'd be personally grateful not only on behalf of our group, but also on behalf of a cause that I believe will be a part of
leading to a trusting relationship between our militaries so that we will have friends in China - not enemies.,

Warm, best regards,

Bill
