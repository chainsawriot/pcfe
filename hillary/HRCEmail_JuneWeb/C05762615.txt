Kyrgyzstan rejects Obama "cooperation" offer
U.S. President Obama has sent a personal appeal to Kyrgyzstan proposing ways to discuss "expanding cooperation".

Kyrgyzstan will not reverse its decision to close a U.S. military air base which is used to supply American troops for
Afghanistan occupation, Kyrgyz Foreign Minister Kadyrbek Sarbayev said on Thursday. U.S. President Barack Obama
has sent a personal appeal to Kyrgyzstan proposing ways to discuss "expanding cooperation".


But Bakiyev's office said in a statement it had received a letter from Obama praising bilateral relations. "Moreover,
Barack Obama expressed hope to further strengthen various forms of cooperation between the United States and
Kyrgyzstan," the statement said without mentioning the air base issue. "The decision to annul all agreements on the
Manas military air base has been taken and there is no turning back on this," he told the 24.kg news agency.
