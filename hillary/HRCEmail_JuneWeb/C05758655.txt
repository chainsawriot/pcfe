Lee--

 I'm very pleased this new challenge is working out so well for you and your family. And, until you're in Warsaw, I
would welcome any thoughts you may have about what I should--or shouldn't!--be saying or doing. Pls send anything
you might have for me directly to Lauren Jiloty, whom I have copied on this email. All the best.

Madam Secretary,

It was terrific to see you the other day for the photo shoot with the ambassador designees. Elaine and I are excited --
and grateful to you -- for the opportunity.

As we discussed, I am in the building, working out of the transition office as the confirmation process inches forward.
Elaine and I are busy gearing up but, as we discussed, I am happy to pitch in on specific projects or anything else if the
need arises. In the meantime, best wishes to you and your family.

Best,
Lee
