Sid--

  I'm copying Doug and Justin who are travelling w Bill since he will be in Europe and may have some ideas about what
could be done, and asking that they share it w him and then get back to you. If I have any other ideas I will let you know.

Re: Latest on EU presidency



The political timing on the EU presidency is accelerating. Sarkozy and Merkel are meeting tonight (October 18) to discuss
it. The Czech constitutional court will issue its verdict on the legality of the Lisbon treaty on November 3. Shortly after,
perhaps that week, before you meet with Merkel on November 8-9, there may be an EU Council meeting to decide the
matter. So you may want to weigh in before then.

Tony is somewhat downcast on his chances. (He met with Jim Hoagland of the Washington Post yesterday; his mood
was described to me.) The Tories have ramped up their campaign against himâ€”not only do they not want him but they
also do not want an effective EU president. Cameron has come down on the side of the anti-EU wing of his party on this,
an easy move. In an intriguing complication, there's talk now of David Miliband becoming EU foreign secretary if Tony
does not become EU president. Miliband denied he was interested and endorsed Tony. This is part of the anti-Blair
campaign ginned up by the Tories, extended to hurt Miliband if they can. Jonathan Powell is less gloomy than Tony,
thinks everything is still in play, which is why your part in this may yet be important.
