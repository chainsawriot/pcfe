Good morning -- I realized yesterday to my chagrin that I did not discuss with you taking a few days off.




Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. Also, I will be taking this time to work up some stuff for
the QDDR and to think through how to advance your priorities and the major issues through the fall (I'll be on the phone
with Strobe and Sandy and others).

I will likely be back in next Monday, but am holding open the possibility of working remotely for a couple more days.

My goal is to be productive through excaping -- and to have a little fun on the side.

I hope you enjoy your time off and don't work to hard.
