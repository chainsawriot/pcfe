  NOTE FOR DEPUTY SECRETARY LEW

  SUBJECT: Afghanistan: Inappropriate Behavior by Department Contractor

  FROM:         1NL â€” David T. Johnson

         Over the course of the last few weeks, employees of DynCorp International,
  the INL contractor in Afghanistan providing police trainers, aviation support, and
  security, have been discovered in a series of compromising situations.

                                            2




          The message was conveyed clearly and bluntly, and given the pattern of
   behavior, we will be watching closely for remedial actions. The DynCorp team
   was contrite, admitted that their internal controls were clearly inadequate if these
   things had occurred, and committed to take effective action, beginning with a visit
   by senior management to Kabul next week.
