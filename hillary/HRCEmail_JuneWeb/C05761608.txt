I'm usually the pessimist, but I'm not sure this is as dire as it seems in the moment from 10,000 miles away.

First, the world/media is fixated on the President's speech, the imagery from Riyadh dominates, there's no Honduras
footage of interest, which is key. Speech tomorrow will blanket coverage and extinguish the Cuba stuff, so we just need
to weather the night.

Second, Tom & Dan did an on the record conf call not long ago and we think they did very well. Dan was especially
strong, and he's also speaking to people 1:1

Third, your statement was strong and the reporting will catch up with it, it's only been out 90 minutes.

Fourth, we are suffering from two significant tactical problems: 1) you are here and removed 2) our press corps was out
of position today and in flight, so the people we worked on all week and the ones likely to skew our way were replaced
by reporters not connected to us.

The two issues above will be rectified tomorrow in your two interviews - especially Greta who is malleable. We can use
that to make a strong case on the principle, and the simple fact Cuba wasn't in the OAS yesterday, and won't be
tomorrow. Everyday that passes reinforces that point. The time difference to East Coast will help us in moving
whatever is said in these interviews tomorrow.

Short term, we started the week showing we can engage with Cuba (mail, migration), and ending it showing we are
serious about our redlines

Long term, we stood up for human rights and that can only be a plus.

Well, Philippe looks right again. CNN is reporting this as being done against my wishes. Any way to salvage?
