Re: Your CFR speech


    1. The draft, sent by separate email, is intended to give you options and ideas. Use as you
       wish. Several ideas are at the core of this version: in particular, the concept of the US as a
       modern global nation and how that serves our capacity for leadership.
    2. For most policy speeches a generic tone and workmanlike prose are acceptable. But for
       this one, it is not. This speech can't afford to be lackluster. It will then be held up in
       invidious comparison to Obama's glittering best efforts. Your speech must have, amid the
       policies, a distinctive and authoritative voice.
    3. Your early draft makes no distinctions between allies or partners; indeed, it barely
       mentions allies. The early draft also features a strong malaise theme. Even if rebutted
       after being raised, the focus is on obstacles and hindrances, not on achievements,
       opportunities and what can be achieved. There's no accounting of progress so far. The
       effect is downbeat in tone. At the same time, the draft contains passages of vague and
       gauzy liberal universalism, while in one line assailing it, an unconvincing juggling act.
       The notion that all nations and peoples want the same things as Americans will not fly
       and is open to derision. It reflects blithe liberal cultural imperialism, among other things.
       (See Graham Greene. And, on the contrary, some nations—and peoples—seek nuclear
       weapons, like Iran; some don't want to curb global warming, like China; some don't care
       about human rights, like most Arab nations; some have contempt for democracy,
       including de facto allies like Egypt, not to mention Myanmar; and some are indifferent to
       poverty, any number of African kleptocracies.) Also there is some confusion of
       definitions, for example, asserting dialogue with adversaries is "strategic engagement,"
       when that is a concept usually applied to allies and partners.
    4. The speech must be crafted with a sense of real time and cannot be delivered out of sync
        with it. Slogans can become shopworn, especially those that lack analytical, historical
        and descriptive power. What served you once, at your confirmation, may not serve again
        in the same way. The most cogent foreign policy columnists from Clive Crook of the
        Financial Times to David Rothkopf of Foreign Policy have already written columns in
        the last week on the limits of "soft power" (i.e., "smart power") and others I understand
        are preparing to make similar criticisms. I would use sparingly or not at all. You do not
