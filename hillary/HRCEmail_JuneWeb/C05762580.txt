NAACP's Bond at the W.H.

By CAROL E. LEE

Tensions between the White House and the NAACP over President Obama.s upcoming address at the
groups 100th ...

....anniversary celebration were *not totally resolved after leaders of the influential civil rights
organization met with two senior White House aides Thursday morning.

*There.s some scheduling adjustments that have to be made,* Julian Bond told POLITICO as he left the
West Wing. But he.s coming..

Bond and Hilary Shelton, the NAACP.s vice president for advocacy, said they met with White House senior
adviser Valerie Jarrett and her chief of staff, Michael Strautmanis.

Bond said the NAACP and the White House have agreed on a date • July 16 but have yet to settle on a time
when Obama will address the groups conference. At issue is the venue.

Ideally Obama.s speech would be at a location that makes it easy for everyone to see him* Bond said. So
far the White House has rejected some suggestions including Yankee Stadium • citing security reasons, and
there is a dispute over exactly what time he will speak.

*It was a healthy, helpful conversation,. Shelton said of the meeting.

Shelton and Bond said they did not see Obama while they were in the West Wing for roughly 45 minutes.

Attorney General Eric Holder is scheduled to address the NAACP.s conference on July 13, they said, and
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is also trying to schedule in appearance. The conference is being held from
July 11 to 16.

Shelton noted that Obama has not missed an annual NAACP meeting since he was elected to the Senate in

And on his way into the meeting, Bond suggested that Obama has the NAACP to thank for his election to the
presidency.

If it weren.t for the work of the NAACP over the past century, he told Urban Radios April Ryan, .a black
man would not be president of the United States today..
