TEGUCIGALPA, June 30 (Reuters) - An interim government set up after a military coup in Honduras said it will send a
delegation of politicians, business leaders and lawyers to Washington on Wednesday for talks on the crisis.
   Roberto Micheletti, sworn in as caretaker president after leftist President Manuel Zelaya was toppled by the army on
Sunday, announced the mission after Zelaya traveled to New York and Washington to address the United Nations and
Organization of American States.
