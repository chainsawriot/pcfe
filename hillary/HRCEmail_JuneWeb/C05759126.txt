I can't pull up the whole email but assume it is fine to go. Any other news? We can talk later if needed.

In speaking to John he pointed out that frame is also to have some of the larger institutions to do and create
development in Africa and other countries and they must see themselves as having obligation of being part of solution.

Subject: Higher Education Dinner on August 17 - Guest

Jake/Huma/Lona:

I've got to have Lona get invites out today - the list is 18 after speaking with the Secretary on theory we will have yield of
12 - 14.

Before I have Lona invite anyone, I want to phase invites so our highest priorities have chance to response first and need
to know how big is too big to work; I have targeted 12-14 outside guests - given an expectation of 6-8 government folks.
