Madam Secretary,
That would be more than fine. I appreciate you even looking to see if this may work.
On another note I wanted to send congratulations to you on the announcement of your daughters engagement. I know
you are proud of her and rightfully so.
Also I had dinner last night with a mutual friend of ours, Sen Lindsay Graham. Lindsay always talks how much he likes
you and said if I were to be in contact with you to say hi from him.
Stay well and I look forward to hearing and seeing you soon.
All my best,
Terry

Terry--

  So sorry I haven't responded before but I've been hip deep in the rollout of the Afghanistan strategy. I am trying hard
to accept this invite but haven't been able to nail down. We will let you know one way or the other by end of next week.
Is that ok?

  I hope you, your family and the futures markets are all well! My very best wishes, Hillary

Madam Secretary-

I hope you, the President and Chelsea had a great Thanksgiving. Hopefully things will wind down and you'll be able to
spend some time with your family. As you know, I'm being honored by the American Friends of the Hebrew University
on Thursday, March 11, 2010. I'd be so honored if you would consider being the keynote speaker. I've had some
correspondence with Lona in your office and she indicated you may have a better idea of your 2010 calendar in early
November. It would mean the world to me if you could do it, but if not I completely understand.

I look forward to seeing you soon.

All my best,
Terry
