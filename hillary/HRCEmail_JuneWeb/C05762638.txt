OK. FYI -Micheletti just concluded a press conference offering to enter into dialogue. They invite the OAS to help, but are
willing to have int'l observers and other int'l orgs. Michiletti also called for a peaceful solution and asked Presidents
Ortega and Chavez specifically to desist interfering in the the internal matters of Honduras. M reported Nica troops on
the border.

Considering Zelaya's late departure from Dulles (3 pm), I recommend we do our conference later rather than earlier. I
suggest 9 pm.
