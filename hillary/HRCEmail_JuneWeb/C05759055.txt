You did a great job on Meet the Press. The only thing I would add is when they ask you about the relationship b/w you
and the White House you can say not only that you are the diplomat in chief and the implementer, but also the architect
of the strategies we need actually to achieve the objectives and the visions that the President lays out. I hope you saw
the piece by Sid Kaplan in Slate that says you and the President are closer than any administration in recent memory. I
hope you get at least a tiny piece of Sunday to yourself! AMS
