Kris-- can you follow up on these issues and let me know so we can report back? Thx.

  Steve Schwarzman at Blackstone wanted help on a visa for                              and said Mickey Kantor was        B3
talking to Cheryl about it. What's status?                                                                                INA
  David Cote of Honeywell wanted help w              _        _         _       _         ....  .               He also     B4
complained about export control regs that interfere w sales. He said the State Dept is the holdup and gave example of
nuts and bolts for an engine being labelled as "dual use and therefore couldn't be exported. Andrew may know about
this.
