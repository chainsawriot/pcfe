COMMENT

Clinton can deliver a tough message to India

By Strobe Talbott
Published: July 16 2009 20:06

When Hillary Clinton arrives in India on Friday, the US secretary of state will no doubt
strike the upbeat tone that befits relations between the world's two largest
democracies. But she is expected also to engage her hosts candidly on two issues that
have been contentious in the past and may be in future: climate change and nuclear
non-proliferation.

In both areas, President Barack Obama's positions are radically different from his
predecessor's. Unlike George W. Bush, Mr Obama understands the need for a rules-
based international system that will regulate and reduce levels of greenhouse gas
emissions and nuclear weaponry. In particular, Mr Bush, like the Republican-controlled
US Senate of the late 1990s, opposed the Kyoto protocol on climate change and the
ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). He also had little use for the
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), even though it was largely an American
initiative going back to the dawn of the cold war.

Those Bush policies suited many Indians. In their view, a global regime to restrict
carbon emissions could hinder India's growth, while the CTBT and the NPT blocked

their right to develop the nuclear-weapons capability their government demonstrated
when it conducted a series of tests in 1998. Under Mr Bush, the US and India
negotiated a pact on co-operation in civil nuclear power that will, when the details of its
implementation are worked out, grant India an exemption from the terms of the NPT.

Mr Obama, however, is committed to ratifying the CTBT, strengthening the NPT, and
pursuing other treaties to prevent the spread of dangerous material and technology. He
also intends for the US to be part of the international effort to replace the Kyoto
protocol with a treaty-based climate-control regime including India, China and other
emerging powers.

As a result, on both proliferation and climate change, many Indians regard Mr Bush
with nostalgia and Mr Obama with muted apprehension. Mrs Clinton, however, is seen
as a staunch friend of India. Her trip there as first lady in 1995 helped break the ice in
US-Indian relations after 50 years of estrangement, paving the way for President Bill
Clinton's visit in 2000. She is therefore in an ideal position to deliver a message in New
Delhi that is both reassuring and cautionary.

The US administration knows it cannot coax or bully India into formally joining the NPT,
nor will it renege on the civil nuclear deal it inherited from Mr Bush. At the same time,
Washington policymakers hope that India's Congress party-led government, now that it
has been returned to power with an increased mandate, will join the US in tightening
the verification authorities of the International Atomic Energy Agency, accelerating
negotiations to stop the production of fissile material (the stuff at the core of nuclear
warheads) and bringing the CTBT into force.

These steps would make India's region safer, since Pakistan might follow suit in a
positive direction, just as it did in a negative one when it conducted a nuclear test
shortly after India's in 1998. A similar appeal to self-interest might prevail with respect
to climate change. Since much of India's population lives in rural and coastal areas, it
is acutely vulnerable to the devastation of agricultural lands and rising sea levels that
come with global warming.

Key figures in India are beginning to accept the idea of a global compact on climate
change. However, they are focused on the 12-to-1 disparity between the average
American's carbon footprint and the average Indian's. Therefore they want progress
towards parity in the final agreement. If the US achieves the 80 per cent cut in
emissions by 2050 that Mr Obama supports, the gap between the US and Indian
footprints per capita would shrink dramatically.

Indians (like many Americans) need to be persuaded to see the urgency of prompt
action. There are few voices more persuasive than that of the Indian scientist R. K.
Pachauri, the head of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change who shared the
2007 Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore. He believes that the world has about six years

to impose drastic and effective reductions on greenhouse gases. That will only happen
if Mr Pachauri's and Mrs Clinton's governments can make common cause.
