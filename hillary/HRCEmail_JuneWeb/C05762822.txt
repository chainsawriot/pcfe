i like virtually everything in the two-pager, and I do agree with Tom on the notion of elevating the "national
interest" and security elements of this, both because those have become part of her "brand," and also to help
flesh it out in a way that both gives it the widest reach, and also protects it from attack.

some ways to consider doing that might be to just ensure that the overarching description of it "call out" the
national interest/security reasoning at work - something like "America has the opportunity and the responsibility
to lead in the creation of a network of principled partnerships that will serve our national interest, enhance our
security and build the capacity of people and nations to solve global problems and give everyone more power to
reach their potential."

(i inserted "network" of principled partnerships because i think it kind of alludes to both the diversity of the
kinds of partnerships as well as to the influence of technology on building them...not a "must have" but just a
thought... .in the same vein, i don't know whether there might be an advantage in alluding to a network of
"pragmatic and principled partnerships" or "practical and principled partnerships" just to ensure it's got that
pragmatism aspect of it sharply inserted).

I like the substance and I might consider if there are ways to communicate, or more strongly affirm, some elements that
would be important for audiences to hear, including that this is an approach of leadership, self-interest, and values. The
values I mean are things like security, stability and building opportunity. Those pieces are in here, but the notion should be
clear that we are not ceding leadership, we are leading by building alliances and partnerships. And we will always stand
for what is right and the right to defend ourselves and our allies, but we are fighting as we always have for shared values.
Make sense? Tom

I tried out "principled partnership" on her this morning and she likes it â€” I really think we're almost there. Pse
let me know whether I can distribute this more widely for tomorrow's mtg.
