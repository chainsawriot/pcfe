Just learned Holbrooke will be back Tues night and be in office all day Wed. I've decided not to go to Cronkite service so I
can see him either Tues or Wed.

Ok on McCain mtg.

I made a few changes to the line block yesterday so happy to send to you after I follow up on these items -- you will
have meetings this week on Iran, Iraq and Non Pro with the Iran team tomorrow.
- Hill is on Friday with the Iraq team -- you can see him privately either before or after.
- Will move Holbrooke to 8am on Thursday.
- Can I offer Collins, McCain, Graham and Lieberman Friday morning for a meeting?
- Will follow up on Daalder, Kessler, Rahm and women's lunch/dinner.

For Tuesday, when will I see Daalder and Hill?

I'm not sure I have the time to go back to NY for Cronkite funeral altho I would still like to.

I need more time w Holbrooke on Thursday so see if he can be moved to 12:45 or another time that works like 8am.

I want to meet w people Thursday night so pls don't schedule anything after Capricia's event.

On Friday, can Kessler be moved to next week?

Rahm told me there may be a small mtg w the POTUS on Sunday morning so I may need to take plane back either late
Sat night or early Sun am. Also Rahm said he wanted to see me alone sometime before that Sunday mtg. Pls follow up
on both mtgs.

If there is a Sunday am mtg w POTUS, I will also try to go to the Ling lunch.

Why are there no early staff mtgs listed for Thurs the 10th and Fri the 11th on the line?

I see the Iran dinner on the schedule but not a women's policy lunch or dinner. Can we do that Monday the 14th or
Thursday the 17th? I want to do it before the Development speech.

Talk w Cheryl and others about doing the development speech in NY combined w "town hall" at a college or other venue
on Monday. the 21st (which would make Philippe happy).
