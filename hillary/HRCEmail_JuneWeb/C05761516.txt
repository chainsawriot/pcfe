Cheryl -

1 understand from Susan that you and she both received word that a decision has finally been made. We have gotten
cleared around the building this evening a package with terrific help from 10 and DRL of a press statement, talking points
and a cable notifying posts of the decision. NSC has cleared as well. We will not launch until tomorrow at 2:00.

As part of the launch plan NSC has asked that we use quotes from Secretary Clinton and Ambassador Rice in the press
statement. We would like to work with whoever is appropriate (Jake and Robert?) traveling with the Secretary to get a
one sentence quote for the statement. Jennifer Simon on our staff will email you the draft statement shortly. Please let us
know with whom we should follow up as we want to ensure we preserve the close hold nature of this process.

Thanks - Erica

(P.S. Ops has left a message for you as well from me - this is the topic - feel free to call anytime if you'd prefer
discussing).
