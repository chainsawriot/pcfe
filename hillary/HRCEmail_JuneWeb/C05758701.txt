A year later, Hillary wins



A year ago today, the final set of primaries made official the foregone conclusion that Barack Obama had won the
primary, and Hillary Clinton lost it.

There's far too much going on today to dwell on an anniversary, but it does seem worth noting one particular piece of
news in its light: On the central health care policy debate of the Democratic Primary -- which was, to be fair, conducted
within a fairly narrow frame -- Obama appears to have conceded today to a Senate plan likely to more closely resemble
Clinton's.

In a dense, careful letter <http://www.politico.com/static/PPM118_090603_healthcare_ltr.html> to Ted Kennedy nd
Max Baucus, Obama offered his principles <http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0609/23298.html> for a health care
plan and conceded on a central point: He is now open to an individual mandate, which he campaigned against, and
which is now being talked about by Senators of both parties with the buzzword "shared responsibility."

Obama still backs a "hardship waiver" for people unable to afford the mandate -- which is consistent with the core of his
objection to the mandate. But what he cast as a principled difference of approach -- was the problem merely that
people couldn't afford insurance? or something more? -- seems to have been conceded.

Here's the relevant paragraph:

        I understand the Committees are moving towards a principle of shared responsibility -- making every American
responsible for having health insurance coverage, and asking that employers share in the cost. I share the goal of ending
lapses and gaps in coverage that make us less healthy and drive up everyone's costs, and I am open to your ideas on
shared responsibility. But I believe if we are going to make people responsible for owning health insurance, we must
make health care affordable. If we do end up with a system where people are responsible for their own insurance, we

need to provide a hardship waiver to exempt Americans who cannot afford it. In addition, while I believe that employers
have a responsibility to support health insurance for their employees, small businesses face a number of special
challenges in affording health benefits and should be exempted.
