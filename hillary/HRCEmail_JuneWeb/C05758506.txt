Madam Secretary-

I hope this note finds you and your family doing well. I've been following all of your activities over the last several
months. You are doing an incredible job, which I'm sure is a surprise to no one. I'm going to be in DC May 19-21. We
have our annual gathering out there with about 150 folks coming out from the Exchange. I know this is probably a long
shot at best, but we are having a dinner for our group at the Hay Adams on Tuesday, May 19 and it would be a
tremendous honor if you would come by and say a few words. If this doesn't work but you are in town, I'd love to stop
by for 5 minutes to say hello. Please let me know if any of this is possible. I look forward to seeing you soon.

All my best,
Terry
