Subject:                       followup on Danspeckgruber



Holbrooke's shop reached out to Danspeckgruber and offers the following update:

   • Funding for railroads in and out of Afghanistan is on the agenda of next week's Regional Economic
      Cooperation Conference on Afghanistan in Islamabad. We are aiming for the Asia Development Bank
       to agree to fund feasibility studies for railroad. If ADB agrees, then we will link up Dr Danspeckgruber
       with the right ADB reps.
