I read that CM is in Philadelphia                   but if she's back I'd at least like to call again. The timing, however, is   B6
hard for a visit since I need to see Santa around 7:45 after seeing Lisa. It might work if she's there and wants to see
people other than close friends. What do you think?

Was checking to see if I needed to make arrangements for you to do anything earlier.
