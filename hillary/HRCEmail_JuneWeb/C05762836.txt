Tom backgrounded them yesterday in the briefing room, not certain but don't think he put down any groundwork on
this specifically.



But in terms of setting expectations it would be a combo of a few overt and not overt things:

- Seeing what Admin/For Pol Members of Congress are on TV today and the shows tomorrow, all we need is one person
to float it.

- We have flight time tomorrow when Tom & Jake can do it on background or OTR.

- There's one blogger that folks loosely follow, I know how to get her something through a 3rd party.

- I have to talk to a few of our guys today like Matt Lee on misc stuff, and I'm sure he'll ask me something about the OAS
where I can easily say the folks in WHA are real pessimistic. And our travelers traffic info among themselves. The best
thing to put out there would be the notion that there are those who don't think you should go. If you don't, you don't.
But if you do, you chose to be direct, to make a principled stand.

Shouldn't be too tough, because the notion of Cuba being voted in is something they will WANT to believe, it'll make
good copy. And it makes it easier to explain any decision/outcome

How will we set any expectations? Did anyone background the press yet?

If we set the expectation now that the outcome is likely to not go our way, ANY alternative - even one kicking the can
down the road as Jake outlines below - would be seen as a significant victory.

And as an added bonus, it would be an opportunity to highlight your personal dedication to and prioritization of human
rights/democracy, which we've been criticized for since China.
