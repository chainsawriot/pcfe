Zelaya tentatively on for 1 (but we understand it might fall thru) but we are currently planning on it.
Uribe is asking to talk to you. He's available the rest of the evening and we can also do tomorrow morning but he didn't
confirm availability for tomorrow. I've asked tom and jake for points for u.

Did he ask to speak to me? I didn't reach out to him but I'm willing to talk once I get points. Is Zelaya confirmed for
tomorrow? I didn't see him on schedule so did it just happen?
