Subject: Demarche on UNGA redlines

FYI: We will send today for your review and approval a demarche describing the circumstances in which the U.S. would
walk out of speeches at the UN General Assembly and asking countries to join us in the walkout. Note that we are
differing from past practice when we simply did not have anyone in the U.S. seat during speeches by certain countries.
This year an appropriate-level individual will be behind the U.S. placard for all speeches and will remain unless these
redlines are crossed.




This demarche is going out to EU member state capitals, as well as Oslo, Reykjavik, Ottawa, Canberra, Wellington, Tokyo,
Seoul, Buenos Aires, Bogota, San Jose, and Montevideo. USUN asks that our posts deliver the demarche in advance of an
EU political directors meeting on this issue in New York Monday morning our time.




The background portion,of the cable, which discusses EU internal dynamics on this issue, is classified, but the
unclassified talking points will come to you for your review.
