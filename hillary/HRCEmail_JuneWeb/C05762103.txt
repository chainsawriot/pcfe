 President Obama congratulates India on its historic national elections. By successfully
 completing the largest exercise of popular voting in the world, the elections have strengthened
 India's vibrant democracy and upheld the values of freedom and pluralism that make India an
 example for us all.

 While the world awaits the formation of a new government in India based on the elections result,
 the United States recognizes the significance of the election for the people of India, who remain
 the strength and foundation for India's prosperity and democracy.

  President Obama looks forward to working with the new Indian Prime Minister, once he has
  taken office, to continue and enhance the warm partnership between our two countries.
