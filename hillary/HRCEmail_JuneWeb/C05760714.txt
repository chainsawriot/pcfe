Gov R called back. I gave him a general brief on the launch and we discussed the call last night from KMG re a possible
trip. Gov R said that he would continue to "stay under the radar" on the matter, "despite many interview requests." He
added that he has been talking to Lisa Ling of the View and urging her to also stay low-profile, although he said she may
feel that she has to speak out soon. He agreed to keep in touch with us over the next few days.
