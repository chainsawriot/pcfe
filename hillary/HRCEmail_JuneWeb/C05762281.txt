I did update a number of your contacts while you were at the FAPE dinner last Monday. They all were saved. I updated
them from what I have in my blackberry, so this is from memory, but there were probably more:

Philippe
Monica
Jake
Andrew
Melanne
Todd Stern
Steinberg
Jack Lew
Kris
Lissa
Pam
Tamera
Anne Marie Slaughter
Miguel R
Robert Wood
Rob Russo
Laura Pena
Heather Samuelson

I'm making a list of other building people you may not have, and I'll do them tonight when you are in Netenyahu dinner.
They include:
Ian Kelly

Which names did you put in? Maybe they didn't save. But I need a lot. Pls make a list and I will check and add if
necessary.
I'd like to set up call to Sonia Gandhi in next few days.
