Cheryl: My staff assistance received a call from the "Line" saying you might want a short informal note to send to the
Secretary on                                                                                           Below is a        B7(A)
shorter and updated version of what I sent you earlier. I will be on leave for a week beginning tomorrow and one my
deputies, Bill Fitzgerald, will be following this issue in my absence. Regards, Johnnie

Coming on the heels of your trip to Africa, and the emphasis you placed on gender-based violence and sex crimes, we
are making every effort to ensure
Liberians need to conduct the best possible investigation. The Legal Attache, based in Freetown, is currently en route to
Liberia to assist.
