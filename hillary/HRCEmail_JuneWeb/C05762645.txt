Ghana, but not forgotten
By: Josh Gerstein

It might seem like a moment just too good for the White House to pass up — America's first
black president, on his first trip to sub-Saharan Africa, looking out over a sea of jubilant
faces, delivering a message of friendship and hope.

Yet President Barack Obama, who would command a monumental audience nearly
anywhere he spoke on the continent where he traces his ancestry, is not scheduled to
deliver a speech to the general public when he visits Ghana next week.

The White House said it preferred a smaller event at Ghana's parliament to herald the
nation's democratic traditions. But some suspect the reason has its roots in an event that
holds a storied place in White House lore — President Bill Clinton's 1998 speech to a
massive crowd in the sweltering heat of Accra, Ghana, where Obama will visit as well.

For Clinton, the first stop on a 12-day, six-country African journey was a chance to bask in
the adulation far from Washington, then consumed with the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
Clinton now regularly pegs the size of the crowd that day at 1 million, though years ago he
described it simply as more than 500,000.

Whatever the number, the overheated, overcrowded, overwhelming event left some in
Clinton's party worried that he'd been shot, and a doctor concerned that he could contract
HIV from frantic interaction with the crowd. And it took a threatening turn at the end, as a
red-faced, shouting Clinton implored the crowd, "Get back! Back off!" as it threatened to
crush a woman near the front of the stage.

"The crowd was so large that it began surging towards the stage. Suddenly, a woman in
the front of the crowd began to get trampled," recalled Sandy Berger, Clinton's national
security adviser at the time. "Clinton jumped up and put his arm down over the side and
grabbed her. The Secret Service thought he'd been shot and freaked out."

"He saved her life," Berger said. "It was a kind of tumultuous scene."

Clinton's White House physician Dr. Connie Mariano said she started out that day worried
about the heat, but wound up concerned about HIV.

"It was steamy, and hot, and miserable," Mariano recalled. "[Ghana's president General
Jerry] Rawlings put a ceremonial robe over [Clinton's] dark business suit and I thought,
'Oh my God, he's going to pass out," she said.

Mariano said the feverish crowd and the scuffle over people being crushed at the front left
the president nicked up.

"He got scratches. His hands were cut because people's nails were scratching him
because they wanted to hold him," she said. "Realize how many HIV-positive people there
were there. ... It was an extremely frightening experience."

As the crowd surged forward, police wielding rubber truncheons slammed them down on
the hands of people holding onto the barricades. The front-line people would jump back,
only to be pushed forward, grab the barricades, and have their hands whacked again.
Reporters offering bottled water to parched Ghanaians nearly triggered a stampede.

"I just remember the mass of flesh. There was like a gazillion people, more than I had ever
seen in my life," said Ann Scales, who covered the event for The Boston Globe.

Clinton's speechwriter that day, Ted Widmer, recalled a feeling of sensory overload.

"It was surreal in many ways — just one sensation after the next," he said. "Sweat was
pouring out of every pore in my body. ... I was seeing these people do a lion dance with
deafening drums. ... I've been at plenty of unmemorable political speeches. This one was
carnival-esque and fun."

During the presidential primary campaign last year, Clinton often invoked the memory of
his Accra speech as an example of when he was at his rhetorical peak. "Back when I was
in politics, I was a reasonably good speaker," Clinton told college students in Austin,
Texas last February. "I once spoke to a million people in Ghana."

Estimates of how many people were actually on hand that day vary widely. In Clinton's
book, "My Life," he says "more than half a million people." White House officials speaking
to reporters that day said security aides to Rawlings had also estimated the crowd at more
than 500,000. However, The Associated Press reported that Ghanaian officials put it at
more than 1 million. The New York Times used the half-million estimate, but also reported
that Independence Square, where Clinton spoke, "has a capacity of more than 200,000."

Whatever the true number, Obama isn't trying to top it. He'll address Ghana's parliament,
meet the country's president, and tour a slave fort on Ghana's coast on the final stop of
week-long trip that also takes him to Russia to meet the country's leaders and Italy for a
G-8 summit and to see Pope Benedict XVI.

A senior White House official, speaking on background, said staging Obama's major
speech at the parliament "primarily reflects and emphasizes the importance of different

institutions in the political life of Ghana," the official said.

In a briefing for reporters this week, the National Security Council's director for African
Affairs, Michelle Gavin, indicated Obama's main interaction with ordinary people during his
less-than-24-hour visit will come at the Accra airport during "a departure ceremony that
will allow more Ghanaians an opportunity to participate in the visit."

In addition to the challenges inherent in controlling a friendly crowd, another possible
factor weighing against a major outdoor speech by Obama is the terrorist threat posed by
at Qaeda. The bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania came in August
1998, about five months after Clinton spoke to the throngs in Ghana. Since September 11,
2001, there have also been reports of al Qaeda activity in the West African countries
Liberia and Sierra Leone.

"It's another world," Mariano said. "We were pre-9/11 with Clinton. After 9/11, everything
changed."

Even without a formal public event, thousands of Ghanaians are sure to flock into the
streets in the hopes of getting a glimpse of Obama. There should be no shortage of
pictures of excited Africans cheering the U.S. president's visit.

When President George W. Bush went to Ghana in February 2008, he avoided venues
that might draw a large crowd. There was no grand speech. Bush met with Peace Corps
volunteers at the U.S. ambassador's residence, talked to development groups at a foreign
trade center, took in a one-inning tee-ball game, and attended a State Dinner at Osu
Castle, which was then the seat of government.

One highlight of Bush's visit was the performance of the U.S. national anthem by
American Idol winner Jordin Sparks, who works against malaria.

Of course, in a sense Obama may already have broken whatever record Clinton set in
Accra 11 years ago. When Obama was sworn in in January, Washington, D.C. officials
estimated the crowd at 1.8 million. Other estimates ranged from 800,000 to 3 million. Of
course, no one was in danger of heatstroke. Frostbite was more like it.

In 2008, during the presidential campaign, Obama spoke in Germany to a crowd Berlin
police estimated at more than 200,000.

The purported million-strong turnout for Clinton's speech is all the more impressive given
Ghana's size. The country's population back in 1998 was estimated at 18.5 million, while
about 2 million people lived in the capital.

Berger said Ghanaians still remember the event fondly. "I was in Ghana two weeks ago
and people still talk about it," he said. "Everybody I talked to said they were there."

Scales said keeping Obama out of a mass-crowd situation is "probably a very smart
decision."

"President Clinton was considered by some the first black president," she said. "Just
imagine what kind of crowd America's real first black president could draw."
