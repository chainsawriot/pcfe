I'm happy to have Melanne send it as letter to GOSL Ambassador and maybe UN Rep and only release to SL and related
outlets.

We are waiting for DRL to clear the language. I will call Mike and/or Karen now. Everyone else is comfortable. Then we
will get it to you and put it out in Melanne's voice. You'll have something very soon.

I like the idea of it being issued by someone else but I still want to see it. Let's close this out.
