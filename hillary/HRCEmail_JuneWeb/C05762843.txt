Subject:                            FW: Speech - PJ Crowley, Sandy, Summary



Below are PJ's comments/edits in this email (i.e., no attachment).

All of Sandy's were incorporated in the draft you have except his point
that: "Finally, there needs to be a key para that sets forth the lens through which through which you want the speech to
be seen."

We actually are still awaiting George's comments on ME para.
