Ops just faxed a call sheet for Aliyev to house. Steinberg will be traveling to Baku on July 10, and Jim/Jake/phil think the
call from you will help to pave the way for his trip. There is an info memo on latest developments, a cable summary, and
a bio. You ok with proceeding with setting up call? We can do over next few days if u r ok.
