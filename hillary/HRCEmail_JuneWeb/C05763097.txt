Hillary Consulted Republicans, Neocons, And Liberals For Big
Foreign Policy Speech
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has consulted with a surprisingly diverse ideological bunch in the course of
creating the major foreign policy speech she plans to deliver tomorrow, including Republicans like Henry
Kissinger, Brent Scowcroft and George Schultz, and onetime neocons like Francis Fukuyama, a source familiar
with the speech-writing process tells me.

Hillary is set to deliver her high-profile speech at the Council on Foreign Relations, and is set to articulate her
own policy agenda, one focused on strengthening America's "smart power," according to The Politico. It could
help settle whether she has privately favored a more hawkish stance towards hostile foreign powers, as she
reportedly has.

The array of people she has consulted for this speech is striking in its diversity, boasting a notable array of
Republicans, foreign policy "realists" and hawkish voices. A partial list:

Henry Kissinger, Nixon's secretary of state; George Schultz, Reagan's secretary of state; Zbigniew
Brzezinski, Jimmy Carter's hawkish "realist" foreign policy adviser; Paul Farmer, a doctor and international
humanitarian; Joseph Nye, a major proponent of "soft power," the idea that persuasion and attraction can be
more effective than coercion; Francis Fukuyama, who helped drive the rise of neoconservatism; Brent
Scowcroft; the "realist" national security adviser under George H.W. Bush; Strobe Talbott, Clinton's deputy
secretary of state; John Podesta, the head of the liberal Center for American Progress; and Richard Lugar, the
Republican Senator who has praised Obama's response to the Iran crisis.

Hillary has also consulted with administration figures like President Obama himself, Defense Secretary Robert
Gates, and national security adviser James Jones.

Obviously there's someone here for everyone, and someone here for everyone to dislike, too. The array of
people she consulted strongly suggests that she views the speech as an extremely important moment for both the
Obama administration â€” and for her own tenure.
