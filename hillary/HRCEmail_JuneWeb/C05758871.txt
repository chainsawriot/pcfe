Nita lowey called for you.
Also sending thru a nakasone call sheet. It suggests that you call after the IAEA Board formally acclaims Amano's
election. The meeting to do that is going on now in Vienna, so we will let you know after the election is formally
acclaimed so call can be scheduled if ok with you.
