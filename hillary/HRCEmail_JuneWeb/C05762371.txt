Here are some odds and ends--

I'd like you to meet w me in person or over the phone before the Monday and Thurs mtgs w Asst Secs to set an agenda
of what I want raised

I just heard of something called the "Hillary Center" in Morocco. Can you run that to ground?

I talked w Walter Isaacson about his Palestinian project. Toni Verstandig runs it; pis call her to ask for the materials
which she told me she had prepared during the transition.
