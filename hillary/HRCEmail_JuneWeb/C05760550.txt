Madam Secretary-

I hope you, the President and Chelsea had a great Thanksgiving. Hopefully things will wind down and you'll be able to
spend some time with your family. As you know, I'm being honored by the American Friends of the Hebrew University
on Thursday, March 11, 2010. I'd be so honored if you would consider being the keynote speaker. I've had some
correspondence with Lona in your office and she indicated you may have a better idea of your 2010 calendar in early
November. It would mean the world to me if you could do it, but if not I completely understand.

I look forward to seeing you soon.

All my best,
Terry
