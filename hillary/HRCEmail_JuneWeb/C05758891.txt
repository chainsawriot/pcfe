They are now saying that Zelaya doesn't want to travel tomorrow because wants to participate (remotely) in the burial
ceremony on Monday for those who died in violence at the airport today. He said he will return to Washington on
Tuesday in time to meet in the late afternoon. They are asking if it would be possible to have the meeting sometime on
Tuesday late afternoon instead.

Sorry for the late email, but Central America Office Director Christopher Webster just called me to inquire about a
possible meeting between Zelaya and the Secretary tomorrow. He said they are trying to convince Zelaya to return from
San Salvador to the U.S. and that A/S Shannon indicated the Secretary had said that she would be willing to meet with
him tomorrow. They were wondering if they could give Zelaya a window of time for a meeting (see email below from
DCM in Sal Salvador). Please advise.

Thanks,
Courtney

If you can find out whether Zelaya will be returning to Washington, that would be very helpful.

Jesse:

Did the Nicaraguans indicate where Zelaya is headed? To San Salvador or back to Washington?

I have copied Embassy San Salvador's Charge Bob Blau and Political Counselor Phil Laidlaw. I have also copied
Ambassador Llorens and Tegucigalpa's Acting DCM Douglass Benning (Simon Henshaw is on leave).

Thanks,

Chris

At 1945, local NIC media aired footage from MGA airport of Zelaya getting back on plane. It appeared that FM Rodas
and Ven FM Maduro were also in departing party.

NIC president Ortega put Z on plane at airport, but did not go with him.

Footage was recent, if not live, perhaps no more than 20 minutes old.

Looping other members of SITREP spam -- Managua understands that plane with ousted HOND President Zelaya left
WDC at approx 1500 WDC time. Also understand that plane is expected in Managua at approx 1924 local. Understand
that a separate plane with Argentine Pres Kirchner and Ecuadorian Pres. Correa also left WDC this afternoon en route to
El Salvador.

NEW INFORMATION

About 45 minutes ago, Telesur had images of apparent pro-Zelaya supporters at the airport fence and trying to pull it
down. Security forces inside the airport compound re-deployed to prevent a breach. It seems they did use white smoke
or gas to deter protestor action. Telesur also reported that shots were fired into the assembled crowd and that one or
two people were shot and killed (no names or confirmation). Images of ambulances in crowd were visible.

It seems now that the fence has been breached and a handful of pro-Zelaya supporters move in and out of airport area
to pick up rocks and retreat (there is open, clear area inside fence, possible construction). Security forces have taken up
positions on tarmac, presumably to prevent further incursion.

With respect to Micheleti assertion that NIC troops have mobilized near the border, our NIC contacts, both in GON and
private citizens indicate that there has been NO/NO unusual NIC mil activity at border -- Las Manos or El Espino.
However, as of 1900 Saturday, border contacts at El Espino report that HOND military reinforced its presence by about
70 personnel, who remain at El Espino. We were told this happened at Las Manos as well, but have not yet been able to
confirm with our sources at that border location.

Will continue to monitor and observe.
