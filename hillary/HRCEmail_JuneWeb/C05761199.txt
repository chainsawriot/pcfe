Yes, we have donuts this morning. We will have cake and ice cream for later. 191 find a time at the end of the day. You
are wide open at the end of the day, so it will be easy.
Also, as FYI, we will do another little "get-together" on Friday to send-off Jen to Brussels. So I figure we can do the cake
and ice cream today, and then do wine and snacks on Friday.
