Subject: Questions Taken at the 04-14-09 Daily Press Briefing

For Press Guidance (and for tomorrow's Briefing Book):

     •     L/North Korea: Regarding the Presidential Statement adopted yesterday by the United Nations Security Council,
           that condemns North Korea for its recent missile launch, is it considered "legally binding?"

     •     DRL/NEA/Saudi Arabia: Concerning the report of an eight-year girl being raped in Saudi Arabia, what is the U.S.
           response? (additionally, prepare guidance that, from a human rights violation perspective, could be used when
           responding to future questions that are similar in nature)

Thanks,
FCL
