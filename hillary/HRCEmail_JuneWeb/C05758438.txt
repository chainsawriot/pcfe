Lona -

Gotcha - agree with that concern so let's flag and present to her. I had asked strobe if we could move date but given
that it is their board mtg, they can't.

I do think it provides a useful oppor for her to engage an imp group post her BIG Speech but the first day after such a
long trip is not ideal.

We should share that concern with hrc so she can decide..

It's the day after she returns from an international trip â€” I would prefer not to.

The proposed meeting is built around annual combined board and international advisory council meeting, so we're
locked into June 3. Hope it might still work. Will send full board and council member list.
