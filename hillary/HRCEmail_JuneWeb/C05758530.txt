CA/OCS and EAP/K held a one-hour conference call today with the families of the detained journalists. During the call, 1.4(D)
we briefed the families on the Swedish Ambassador's consular visit with Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee on May 15;              B1
                                                           recent progress on efforts to arrange the release of the
two women; an update on the proposed letter from the Secretary;
                                                                                                                       1.4(B)
                                                                                                                       1 4(D)
                                                                                                                       B1
Media: Although the families have thus far shown restraint from approaching the media to publicize their story, they
are increasingly anxious in response to the DPRK's announcement of a June 4 trial date. They now feel that a media
appeal is necessary and would be helpful to their case, citing the public attention given the Saberi case. They are
considering doing interviews on Larry King Live and/or The O'Reilly Factor.                                              1.4(D)
                                                                                                                         B1
