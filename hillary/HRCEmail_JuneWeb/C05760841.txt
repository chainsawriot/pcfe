Subject: Alternatives Toward Direct Military Action In Somalia.

Dear Professor Mills:

I have substituted for a few weeks in a Poly Sci Class at a Community College here in
California. Some of my very bright Students made some interesting comments. I have
detailed some comments and observations in a letter to the Secretary. Should she or
you have any questions, please call me direct at

Sincerely,

ROBERT A. DANFORD, ACFE. ASIS.

    The Honorable Hillary Rodham Clinton
    Office of the Secretary
    U.S. Department of State
    Washington, D.C.

        Subject: Finding alternatives toward direct military action in Somalia.

    Dear Secretary Clinton:

    I am a Professional Member of the American Society for Industrial Security, and the American College
                                                            57

of Forensic Examiners; I have guest lectured and taught industrial security management, homeland
security, port and harbor security and critical incident response management.

As elated as everyone is over the splendid outcome of the Maersk Alabama hijacking case, as I had
predicted, in today's news, it is reported that four additional vessels were attacked and now Terrorists
are holding some 60 hostages. Before anyone, does anything regarding Somalia, may I make the
following comments and observations.

What is going on in the Gulf of Aden is as an organized criminal enterprise for profit. There are some
250 hostages being held and they are being kept as well as they can be under the circumstances because
the terrorists are expecting a payday out of this. As soon as they see any form of direct Military action in
the northeast at the mouth of the Gulf of Aden, I can assure you more Americans will be abducted, and
we will see another series of video beheadings under a Democratic watch.

I would recommend that the Secretary encourage the United Nations to create an International Maritime
Security Working Group. Since the Shipping Industry has already absorbed something like Fifty Billion
Dollars regarding the various piracy incidents in 2008 alone; they have the resources to contract private
security/military contractors who could work onboard merchant shipping in International Waters.

They could rotate from the northern edge of the threat envelope to the southern end and take direct
action on a case-by-case basis. Through this endeavor, as these targets of opportunity begin to dry up, so
will the piracy activity that the World community has pacified by the payment of extortion money.

Thank you in advance for your anticipated interest, and cooperation in this matter.

Sincerely,

ROBERT A. DANFORD, ACFE. ASIS.
