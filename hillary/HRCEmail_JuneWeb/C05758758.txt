Can you pls bring w you today two clean copies of the startegy memo you, Cheryl, Sandy and Derek worked on so I could
talk w you about today and plan a conf call to discuss tomorrow. Thx.

Also, Tom Donilon told me there would be a dinner Thursday night w Kissinger, Scocroft, Zakaria, Brezinski and principals
and that he wouldn't me to frame and lead off. So we have to get the ducks lined up.
