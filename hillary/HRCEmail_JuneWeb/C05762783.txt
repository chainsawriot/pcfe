Washington Post's "Reliable Source" is reporting that Patti Solis Doyle has signed a book deal with Hyperion,
with an anticipated publish date of 2011.

This Just In . . .
â€¢ Patti Solis Doyle: You've managed Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, been sacked via e-mail, then
resurfaced in the transition office of then-President-elect Obama. What's your next act? Book deal! She's inked it
with Hyperion for an undisclosed amount. Scheduled for 2011, the nonfiction book will trace her political journey --
and, we can only hope, reveal some juicy campaign gossip.
