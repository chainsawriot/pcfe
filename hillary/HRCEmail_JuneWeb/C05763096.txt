Spanish FM Moratinos has requested to speak with you today. Tom can give u verbal download but below are basic
points. Let me know if u want us to set up call
Points:
- We condemn the effort to remove Zelaya from office.

- We are working within the OAS and with our regional partners to resolve this situation quickly and in a manner that
restores democratic order.

Â°- We appreciate the role Spain played in winning quick EU condemnation of the coup attempt.

- Our work is not done. Rebuilding trust among competing political institutions and reducing polarization within
Honduras will take a lot of work. We hope Spain will work with us and the OAS to ensure a restoration of democratic
order that will allow Honduras to carry through with it electoral timetable (presidential vote scheduled for November)

Note from torn:
Aside from the statements issued by the President and the Secretary, we have been working in the OAS Permanent
Council fashioning a consensus resolution mapping out a path forward, reaching out to regional partners ( I have spoken
twice with Salvadoran President Funes, and our Ambassadors have been working with other Central American leaders),
and working within Honduras to limit the damage to Honduras institutions.
                                                                  ;
