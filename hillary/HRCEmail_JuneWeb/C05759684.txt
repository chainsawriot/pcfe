I would love to see you and Randi. I'm copying Lona to see how soon we can schedule. Hope you're well.

Saw you from afar at Capricia's event but had to make a quick exit.

Randi and I would like to visit with you re: child labor issues - if that's possible, whom should I contact to schedule?

Thanks. Hope to see you soon and hope you're well.
