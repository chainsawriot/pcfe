The Berlin event is personally meaningful for me, not least because I was, in 1986, when I was a reporter for the
Washington Post, detained and held in a cell inside the Berlin Wall, after spending a night with dissidents in the east
(who wound up being the leaders of New Forum and overthrew the regime). Have fun at the AdIon (William Shirer's old
haunts). Cheers, Sid
