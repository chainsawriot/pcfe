Bill Clinton to be UN special envoy to Haiti: UN official
UNITED NATIONS, May 18 (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon plans to name former U.S.
President Bill Clinton as his special envoy to Haiti, U.N. officials said on Monday, in a move that could attract
investment in the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation and help stabilize the country. "The announcement is
expected to come soon," one U.N. official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. The official said a formal
announcement could come as early as Tuesday. Clinton, who has galvanized efforts to help the impoverished
Caribbean nation recover from the devastating impact of four hurricanes last year, accompanied Ban on a trip to
Haiti earlier this year. Several other diplomats confirmed the appointment of the former president, who is trying
to help Haiti through his Clinton Global Initiative foundation
