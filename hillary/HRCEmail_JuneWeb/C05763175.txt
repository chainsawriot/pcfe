Do you want me just to drive it over to you? I could be there in 10 minutes.

You should have received two faxes stacked together accidentally. The one you want says "9 pm" on the top left. I am
sending the remaining pages (about 5-6) now. The one that says 8:15 pm is the wrong version so ignore it.
