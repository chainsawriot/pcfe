Reached out tom about your calls this morning.
He reports that the Mexicans are appreciative for the call and are energized. They are reaching out to others to try to
find a helpful solution.
Amorim called the Brazilian Ambassador here, who tom spoke to after your call. Amorim was very happy with the call,
especially the detailed discussion of possible solutions. He professed a desire to work with you to resolve this issue.
Brazil recognizes that it is being tagged as the "blocker on democratic language and wants to get out of the way. That
explains Amorim's heavy push to give this issue back to Insulza. Torn told the Brazilian Ambassador that Insulza has a big
credibility problem in our Congress, and that we, Brazil, Mexico, and others cannot walk away from the issue. This was
being relayed back to Amorim.
Among a core group of countries there is a growing realization that lack of consensus could be very damaging for the
OAS and its members. Tom thinks your calls have injected new urgency into the search for a solution.
He will be sending a classified update on the latest in a few hours. We will pouch to the house.
