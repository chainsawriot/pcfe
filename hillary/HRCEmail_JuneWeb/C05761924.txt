                                           I have some ideas we can discuss tomorrow. Can you stay until 7 if we need
the time?

sure -- bottom line - you need a special security code to get on line from a computer outside the building. Only 1 in 5 of
our employees has gotten the device (fob) that allows you to do this access.

This effort is making sure they get fobs into the hands of more (or all) employees so folks can work from home thereby
increasing productivity substantially since the 4 in 5 essentially do no work from home once they leave the building until
they get in again b/c they don't have access to their email.

FYI - we're going to get a short video from you that we'll put on our site announcing this. It's also one of the ideas we
can use for how we are reforming the department for the reform committee.

Cheryl/Jake:

We're going to forward with the doubling of mobile access to email and productivity tools. It's INSANE that fewer than 1
in 5 state Department are able to access their email or documents when they're away from their desk.
It has contributed to the 9:00-5:00 culture here and exacerbates the disconnection between D.C. and the missions. This
is a good short-term win and by my estimates will produce new fewer than 624,000 more hours of productivity by end
of year one which I think is extremely conservative - it assumes just 1.5 additional hour online per employee per week.
Given that those being given the tools are principally foreign service officers and people more senior than the mean
average DoS employee, I think this is very reasonable. Will put an evaluative instrument into this to see if I'm correct.
More detail on all this below if you want it.

I should point out that Pat Kennedy and the CO have been great. This has been one of several instances where they
listened, they got it, and they're moving forward. The CIO said she'd thought of it before, just didn't know if she could
handle the politics. I'm not going to spend a ton of time on our "corporate IT" but in obvious cases like this I'll keep
jumping in.

Last thing --- this idea got a lot of attention on The Sounding Board. I propose that HRC respond to the staff (maybe in a
quick 60 second video that we post there) saying in effect - Thank you for sharing your thinking. I heard you. Because of
you we're doing this.

Re-enforce that HRC is still listening to the staff.

Subject: Fobs for Everyone

Alec,

  I met with Pat today and we did discuss expansion of the fob program. He is supportive and asked that we do a
decision memo to him. WE need this get decision on funding and longer term strategy but I don't see this as slowing
down an announcement the Secretary might make, we just need to coordinate
timing. Attached is what we are using as the basis for the decision memo.
It is more detail than you need but highlights some of the complexities.
If you have any questions please let me know. Susan
