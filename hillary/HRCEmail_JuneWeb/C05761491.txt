Our twittering guys confirmed that we don't tweet directly from HRC

The closest we come to that is to send out quotes from her official statements, e.g. using the format:

Secretary Clinton: ...We will work with the Goldman family and the Brazilian Government with the goal of ensuring this
young boy's return.

Just saw Newsweek piece and went over site with Nora Nora can show to you. It's a leap for Newsweek to say that
the State Dept DipNote Twittering = Secretary Clinton Twittering. I did a scan (and will do a longer one) but there
appears to be no first person Twittering in Secretary's Clinton's name.

Hi Cheryl,
I do not believe there is Twittering in the Secretary's name. The Twittering is from DipNote, the State Department's Blog
http ://twitte r.co mid ipnote

It will occasionally quote the Secretary but the Twittering should not be done in her name.

But we should not be twittering in the Secretary's name since she is not the person actually twittering.

There is a reference in Newsweek to her twittering and says: Hillary Clinton Style: Dry info and offers 4,788 followers

Can you advise who is twittering in her name and how we can address?

Thanks.
