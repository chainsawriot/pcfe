National Hispanic Leadership Agenda

NATIONAL LATINO LEADERS REPORT ON
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S FIRST 100 DAYS
April 29, 2009



BACKGROUND



Every President of the United States since Lyndon B. Johnson has made some effort to include Hispanics in his
Administration. Hispanics have held top level positions in the administrations of Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard
M. Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush.



Ronald Reagan was the first President to appoint Hispanics to cabinet-level positions. He appointed two and
every President since Reagan has had at least one Hispanic serving in a cabinet-level position in their
administration whether they served two, four, or eight years as President. Bill Clinton was the first to have
three Hispanics in cabinet-level positions at the same time when he exercised his prerogative and elevated the
office of the Administrator of SBA to cabinet level. George W. Bush chose not to continue the designation but
still had two Hispanics in his cabinet throughout his two terms.



All Presidents want to fill positions in their administration with the best qualified persons, and that is the way it
should be. No one should expect to be appointed to any position by the President because of their race, gender
or national origin, even though as presidential candidates they promise to do so. More importantly, given
massive demographic change that the country is experiencing, it is no longer possible to craft or implement
effective policies and programs without the experience and expertise provided by a diverse, truly representative
government.



Still, Presidents try to accomplish something in the course of appointing the best qualified persons to their
administration. Bill Clinton wanted a government that looked like America and in the process named two
Hispanics to head two major departments in his cabinet, elevated a third to cabinet level, brought an
unprecedented number of Hispanics into his administration, and signed Executive Order 13171, which called
for government-wide strategies to address the persistent under-representation of Latinos within the federal

workforce. He was also very much aware of the fact that Hispanics helped him carry 14 of 16 major electoral
vote states in which over 90% of the Hispanic vote was concentrated.



George W. Bush brought a natural sensitivity and affinity to his administration, having served as Governor of
Texas, a state with the second largest Hispanic population in the nation. He too appointed two Hispanics to his
cabinet, chose to extend Executive Order 13171, and, like Clinton, brought a reasonably high number of
Hispanics into his administration. Similarly, George Bush was very much aware of the fact that Hispanics
helped him carry six major electoral vote states in which 90% of the Hispanic vote was concentrated.



Barack Obama assumed the Presidency promising change, which lends itself more to qualitative measurement
than quantitative. Still, during his first 100 days he nominated three Hispanics to major cabinet-level
positions. One nominee withdrew and the other two were subsequently confirmed by the Senate. It remains to
be seen how many Hispanics are ultimately named to high positions in his administration, and whether he will
choose to extend Executive Order 13171. And, like his last two predecessors, he too is very much aware of the
fact that Hispanics helped him carry 14 of 16 major electoral vote states in which 90% of the Hispanic vote is
concentrated, in addition to North Carolina, Virginia, and Indiana.



On comparing the Clinton, Bush, and Obama Administrations



In order to make a fair comparison as to how Hispanics have fared during the first 100 days of the Clinton,
Bush, and Obama administrations, one should first recognize that the Hispanic community has changed
considerably since 1992. In 1992 the estimated Hispanic population was 22.4 million, 5.1 million were
registered to vote, approximately 4.2 million voted, and 61% voted for Clinton. In 2000 the estimated Hispanic
population was 33.3 million, 7.5 million were registered to vote, approximately 5.9 million voted, and 35%
voted for Bush. In 2008 the estimated Hispanic population was 44 million, 14 million were registered to vote,
approximately 10 million voted, and 67% voted for Obama. So not only has the Hispanic population grown
exponentially since 1992, the Hispanic electorate has grown dramatically, and in 2008 helped carry traditional
states and more importantly proved decisive in carrying non-traditional states.



So from Clinton to Obama the Hispanic population doubled, voter registration nearly tripled, and voter turnout
more than doubled. Obama received more Hispanic votes than the combined total number of votes cast in 1992
and 2000. He received 4.1 million more Hispanics votes than Clinton in 1992 and 4.6 million more Hispanic
votes than Bush in 2000. The November 2008 election created a new political reality — a new political reality
that has emboldened the Latino community and Latino leaders to demand the change President Obama
promised and to expect more than we got from both Clinton and Bush. Clinton and Bush did not give Hispanics
something to strive for. They gave us something to surpass. Anything less is not change, but more of the same
or worse.



President Obama's first 100 days

President Obama is to be commended on the appointments of Hispanics he has made to date and for the access
to the process that NHLA has had, but NHLA is very disappointed in the overall results. For the record, the
Transition Team and NHLA leaders worked very closely from the beginning to find and encourage well
qualified Hispanics to apply. Once the President was sworn into office NHLA continued working with the
White House Office of Presidential Personnel to ensure that more Hispanics would be nominated and appointed
and that more prospective candidates would continue to apply. NHLA commends the President for the access
we have had and the transparency with which the process has been conducted, but the results speak for
themselves. These efforts fell well short of the target. Latinos remain one of the most under-represented groups
in government and the most under-represented at the Senior Executive Service level.



We are also mindful of the fact that senior White House appointees and the Office of Presidential Personnel
have been similarly accessible to other Hispanic groups on matters pertaining to personnel as well as policies,
and the President is to be commended for that as well. But regardless of the group with which the
Administration has worked, the results have fallen below target and Latinos remain seriously under-
represented.



As of April 27, has announced 58 Hispanics who have been nominated or appointed to positions in the Obama
administration, including 19 that require Senate confirmation.



The Cabinet. NHLA commends the President for nominating two highly qualified Hispanics to major cabinet
level positions — Hilda Solis at Labor and Ken Salazar at Interior. Both departments are extremely important,
given the nature, scope, and purview of their responsibilities.



And while NHLA also commends the President for nominating a third Hispanic, Governor Bill Richardson, to a
major cabinet level position (Commerce), NHLA is extremely disappointed in that another Hispanic was not
nominated from the impressive list of well qualified and experienced Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, and Cubans
that NHLA provided when Governor Richardson withdrew, considering that no Puerto Ricans, Dominicans,
Cubans, or Central and South Americans had been nominated for anything at the time.



The White House. NHLA commends the President for appointing four highly qualified Hispanics to senior
staff level positions in the White House — Cecilia Munoz, Louis Caldera, Adolfo Carrion, Jr., and Moises Vela,
Jr.



But NHLA is extremely disappointed in that only four Hispanics are among the 49 Presidential appointees
selected to date to fill senior staff positions in the White House and that no Cubans or Dominicans have been
included.

And while NHLA commends the President for appointing five highly qualified Hispanics to the position of
Special Assistant to the President including Alejandro Perez at Legislative Affairs, Michael Camunez at
Presidential Personnel, and Roberto Rodriguez, Carlos Monje, and Tino Cuellar at the Domestic Policy Council,
NHLA is extremely disappointed in that not one Hispanic has been appointed Assistant to the President or
senior advisor, the President's inner circle. NHLA is also disappointed in that not one of the five Special
Assistants is Puerto Rican, Cuban, or Dominican.



The Sub-Cabinet. NHLA also commends the President for nominating 17 highly qualified Hispanics to
Senate-confirmation required sub-cabinet level positions at various departments —

NHLA is extremely disappointed in both the number of Hispanics appointed to date and that not one single
Hispanic has been nominated for a position that requires Senate-confirmation at four major departments
including Interior, Health and Human Services, Treasury, and Defense.

positions have been filled to date, none by a Hispanic. There are 75 positions yet to be filled, which provide an
excellent opportunity for qualified Hispanics to be appointed and for the Obama Administration to improve on
its record.



Conclusion. While NHLA commends the President for his commitment to change, there is none to be seen with
regard to personnel. Hispanics are under-represented at the sub-cabinet and senior staff levels, and on the
White House staff Of the countless number of positions filled to date by the Administration, including senior
advisors, Cabinet, sub-cabinet, White House staff, and senior staff in major departments, only 58 have been
filled by Hispanics. This is not change. This is more of the same, below target. More announcements of
Latinos being nominated for Senate confirmation required positions are expected in the coming days, weeks and
months, which will undoubtedly improve what has been accomplished during the President's first 100 days.



NHLA would respectfully suggest to the President that he impress upon his Cabinet Secretaries, senior White
House staff and the Office of White House Personnel, and the Office of Personnel Management that they need
to be more attentive to the serious under-representation of Hispanics in the Obama Administration. NHLA
respectfully urges the President to order an agency-by-agency review of the hiring process being utilized and
request a "Plan for Change and Improvement" from each department as it pertains to appointing more Latinos
for high level positions, and urge him to call for a comprehensive report on Hispanic employment in 90 days.



The 16 departments surveyed in this report have a combined total of 205 vacancies which would be the logical
place to start implementing a "Plan for Change and Improvement" and increasing the number of high-ranking
Hispanics in the Obama Administration including Senior Executive Service level positions.



The all but total lack of Hispanic appointments to councils in the Executive Office of the President, as well as to
Regulatory Agencies and Independent Agencies, is a great source of disappointment to NHLA and leaves very
much room for improvement. NHLA respectfully urges the President to order a thorough review of all
applications submitted to identify qualified Hispanic candidates for possible appointment to boards,
commissions, and agencies, and to request more applications if necessary.



NHLA remains committed to working with the President, the Office of Presidential Personnel, and all
departments to assist in identifying qualified Hispanics to serve in the Obama Administration, but realizes that
the direction and enforcement must come from the President.



Finally, we commend the President for the aggressive steps he has taken to address tough issues of public policy
that, while affecting all Americans, have disproportionately had an adverse affect on the Latino community, i.e.,
mortgage foreclosures, unemployment, education, health (SCHIP), small businesses and immigration
reform. NHLA also looks forward to working with the President and his Administration on specific proposals
that affect all Americans and the Hispanic community particularly, pertaining to education, civil rights,
immigration, economic empowerment, health, and governmental accountability.

NHLA reaffirms its unqualified commitment to continue working with the President and those in his
Administration to help get America back on the right track and moving again.
