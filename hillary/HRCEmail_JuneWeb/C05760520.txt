Problem is, we need to get the statement out tomorrow (Aug 31), so that "six weeks" falls on Oct 12 â€” before the soccer
match. Even in best of worlds this will require further haggling with other side over next 24 hours, so I fear if she
doesn't call til afternoon on 31st (Turkey/Armenia time) we won't get it done.

If she really can't do it today would suggest Jim do so (could blame Kennedy funeral) because we need to try this today.

Huma:

For the Davutoglu call, here is a copy of the text the Turks (Davutoglu) have agreed to release tomorrow, if the
Armenians agree. And as noted in the call sheet, they will only agree if Turkey agrees on a date in advance of Oct. 14 for
the signature of the documents. Let me know if any questions.

Phil
