Wolffe covered the entire length of Barack Obama's presidential campaign for Newsweek magazine, traveling
with the candidate and his inner circle from his announcement through election day, 21 months later.

As a political analyst on MS7VBC, he appears frequently on Countdown with Keith Olbermann and Hardball. On
NBC, he has featured as a political commentator on Meet The Press and TODAY. He features prominently in
the forthcoming HBO documentary on the Obama campaign, and played a leading role in the HBO
documentary of the 2000 Bush campaign, Journeys With George. He previously appeared on CNN and Fox
News, as well as international media including British, Canadian and Australian television.

He now writes regularly for The Daily Beast.

As Newsweek's senior White House correspondent, his cover stories included What He Believes (on Obama's
faith) Black & White (about Obama and racial politics), Bush In The Bubble (after Hurricane Katrina) and
Weight of the World (how Bush handled the Lebanon war). Wolfe joined Newsweek in November 2002 as
diplomatic correspondent, covering foreign policy and international affairs. In the 2004 presidential election, he
covered the Howard Dean campaign before switching to John Kerry.

Before Newsweek, Wolfe was a senior journalist at the Financial Times, serving as its deputy bureau chief and
U.S. diplomatic correspondent in Washington. He reported on U.S. foreign policy, covered the Microsoft
antitrust trial, as well as regulatory and business issues at Treasury, the Federal Trade Commission and
Securities and Exchange Commission.

In April 2009, he joined Public Strategies, a business advisory firm, as Senior Strategist.

Wolfe is the co-author of The Victim's Fortune, (HarperCollins, 2002), about the deals that led to billions of
dollars in compensation to the Nazis' victims in the late 1990s. He also co-authored two Spanish cookbooks,
Tapas: A Taste of Spain in America (Clarkson Potter in the US and Planeta in Spain, 2005) and Made in Spain:
Spanish Dishes for the American Kitchen (Clarkson Potter, 2008). He has also written for food magazines such
as Food Arts and Food & Wine. He authored an upcoming book on Obama's campaign called Renegade: The
Making of a President.
