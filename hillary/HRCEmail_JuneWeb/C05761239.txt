Thanks so much. I don't know what the NSC has or will read so we need to think of this submission as representing our
views for historical purposes.

We are meeting this morning to do a final scrub of the package, and we'll address this.

There's a lot of good work in these papers and I thank everyone who helped. I have the following questions:

Why is there overlap btw what we sent over to the NSC already and what we have compiled into the larger
presentation? By my review, Tabs 1, 3, and 6 are in both packages. If we want to include these in both, we need an
annotated index that lists all the papers not just the main tabs.
