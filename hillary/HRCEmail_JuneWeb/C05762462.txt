Fyi. The latest on the Sean Goldman case.

The Lins e Silva family will appear on CBS tomorrow morning with a tape showing an interview with Sean
Goldman where he says he wants to live in Brazil and that he considers Lins e Silva his father. David Goldman
and his attorneys are extremely upset about Sean being exploited this way. The federal court that just
decided that David should have custody whenever he is in Brazil believes the Lins e Silva family and maternal
grandparents are doing all they can to alienate Sean from his father.

We have been asked to provide CBS with a written statement about all that is being done to reunite Sean with
his father. This is In the works now.




Here is what we know about the tape:

Family Releases New Psych Transcript

Brazilian press have reported the release of a transcript of a new psychological interview of Sean Goldman,
quoting Sean as stating that he considers Lins e Silva his father and that he wants to stay in Brazil. Press
reports indicate that this interview was taped, and took place in front of witnesses from the Rio state level
children's rights organizations. At least one report then referred to the controversy of the psychological exam,
and quotes a psychologist as saying that the mother's family may be increasing the boy's suffering by making
him talk once more, thereby reliving the child's traumas. Almost all reporting points out that the psychologist
conducting the interview was hired by the maternal family

Colleagues,

Bernie Aronson called Milt this afternoon to let him know that the Lins e Silva family will be in the U.S.
tomorrow to make an appearance on CBS. The family will be bringing a video of Sean. I don't have any more
details, but wanted to pass on the heads up.
