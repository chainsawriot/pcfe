                        Broader Middle East and North Africa
                           Democracy Assistance Dialogue

 While many initiatives launched under the G8-Broader Middle East and North
 Africa (BMENA) umbrella continue to make advances, the most striking progress
 is in the Democracy Assistance Dialogue (DAD), which brings together NGOs and
 governments in an ongoing basis to advance democratic reform in the region.
 Representing a network of hundreds of BMENA NGOs and government
 representatives, and with multilateral support, the DAD is now focused on in-
 country activities that will implement reform recommendations from the Forum
 deliberations. To date, the DAD has convened activities in Morocco, Algeria,
 Jordan, Turkey, Yemen, and Italy. The DAD represents a series of thematic
 meetings, activities and research characterized by consultation and partnership
 between governments and civil society. The DAD's three areas of focus are
 women's empowerment, political pluralism, and freedom of expression.

 The DAD partners developed "A Partnership between G8, BMENA Governments
 and Civil Society." This Partnership Document reflects the contributions of many
 BMENA governments and civil society leaders alike and outlines a framework of
 universal, democratic principles to strengthen the relationship and partnership
 between governments and civil society in the region. This document was
 acknowledged by government and civil society representatives at the 2008 Abu
 Dhabi Forum and is a product of based on substantive discussions and
 deliberations between civil society and governments that began nearly two years
 ago.

 Since its inception more than five years ago, the DAD has facilitated effective and
 successful relationships between willing governments, NGOs, the media, political
 leaders and civil society experts in the region, and has created a collaborative and
 transparent environment in which to accomplish this partnership. DAD partners'
 work on in-country programs, including women's empowerment in Algeria, Jordan
 and Pakistan, and as well programs in Morocco and Yemen that are focused on
 freedom of expression, political party and electoral reform, are notable.
