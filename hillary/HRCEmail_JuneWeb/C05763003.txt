Dear Cheryl,




I want you to know that last month a friend of mine convinced me to apply for a fellowship at Harvard/Institute of
Politics, and I did. A few days ago, I got a call from the Program Director who informed me that I was accepted. I am very
excited about it and think it will be a very good opportunity to share my experience                    with students who
are learning theories about democracy and development.

Cheryl, I am going to be bold and ask you if you would accept my invitation to come and speak to the students while I
am there. I am asked and encouraged to invite important personalities who can talk of their experience in government
and I thought of you. I would be thrilled if you accept. I will be there from end of January until the beginning of May next
year. I have also invited President Moreno of IDB who accepted and I am waiting for an answer from Michaelle Jean, the
General Governor of Canada.

I wish you the very best, to you and your family for Christmas and the New Year. I hope our roads cross again as we
thrive to better the lives of so many people who deserve it. Please extend my wished to the Secretary of State. I admire
her and her work.

Warm regards,

Michele
