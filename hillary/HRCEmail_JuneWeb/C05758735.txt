        Was going to write earlier re Palau willingness to take the 17 Guantanamo Uighurs -- but see the story has now
broken. I am now representing Palau, primarily re extension of free association w/ the U.S. In touch w/Fried's office re
Uighurs. Big commitment for Palau since Chinese tourism was planned and its close geographically, etc. but their
premium is on U.S. relations (as sadly demonstrated by the loss of a Palauan in the U.S. Army in Afghanistan last week).

        Also, just FYI now, I've been concerned that the Budget includes a far too low placeholder for free association
extension aid, $45-9 m over 10 years, although the aid is to be based on a joint review of need that will really begin with
a Palauan presentation Friday. (I think the number didn't reflect any rethinking by this Administration). The U.S. is to
respond in a month.
