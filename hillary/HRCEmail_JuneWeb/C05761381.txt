SRI LANKA: RAJAPAKSA TO DECLARE VICTORY, IDP NEEDS GROW
(SBU) The government and NGOs are struggling to respond to the needs of 60-80,000 civilians who fled the
conflict zone since May 15 and are still arriving at IDP camps. Shelter, water, basic health care, and sanitation
are the most urgent needs among the 280,000 civilians now in overcrowded camps. UNSYG Ban will travel to
Sri Lanka May 22. The EU pushed for an independent investigation into alleged human rights violations in the
war, mainly over reported civilian deaths. Czech FM Kohout said the inquiry should be carried out by Sri
Lankan authorities, but could involve non-government and UN bodies. (Colombo 539, Reuters)

SOMALIA: ISLAMISTS CAPTURE PRESIDENT'S HOMETOWN
(SBU) Al-Shabaab seized the key town of Jowhar north of Mogadishu as pro-government militia deserted their
positions near the capital, media report. The government has lost control of most of south and central Somalia;
press report insurgents are heading toward the border town of Beledweyn near Ethiopia. The Transitional
Federal Government (TFG) requested support from other armed factions in the fight against al-
Shabaab. Embassy Nairobi comments the TFG plans to lobby Ethiopia for support at a May 20 regional
ministerial meeting. (Nairobi 1010, Reuters)

MALAWI: MAY 19 ELECTIONS TOO CLOSE TO CALL
(SBU) Parties are skeptical of the integrity of the electoral process, although the U.S. embassy and international
partners will deploy observers, Embassy Lilongwe reports. (Lilongwe 257)

PAPUA NEW GUINEA: VIOLENCE TARGETS ASIAN BUSINESSES
(SBU) Attacks against ethnic Chinese-owned businesses have spread throughout the country since May 12,
with some localities reporting thousands of rioters, according to Embassy Port Moresby. Post adds the violence
demonstrates growing resentment of ethnic Chinese economic influence. The disturbances caught authorities
by surprise, and the government has not yet taken action against those involved, according to the Papua New
Guinea desk. The embassy comments the racial basis of the attacks is a new phenomenon in the country, where
the tribal fragmentation of society has kept such nationalist violence from occurring previously. (Ops/Papua
