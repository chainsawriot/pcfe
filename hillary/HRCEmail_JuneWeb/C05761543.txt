To All:

Tom wanted you to know that he and Hector Morales just departed Jamaica after meeting with Caribbean

we would go into more detail at the May 20 experts meeting in Suriname.

--The FMs look forward to meeting with S in San Pedro.Sula at the OASGA.

--On Cuba, the FMs expressed sympathy with what we are trying to do, but want to hear more about next
steps.

Best,
