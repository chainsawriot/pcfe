Yes--but I don't want to lose the Sri Lankan call for today since it's taken awhile to set up and is very important. So that's
the key.

Yes -- Stephens is in DC all day, we can work with Ops on the call. I don't think we need to push the Angolans more than
15 minutes so should be fine. Should I move forward and adjust?

Can we try to change the Sri Lanka call and reschedule Stephens and postpone until later the Angolans so I can go to
speech?
