Dear Hillary.

You have an extraOrdinarily large heart. Your selflessness and belief in and tireless work for what is true touches me
deeply.

Thank you for all you have done. I will keep you posted. Don't know if you have a few minutes for me to stop by after
my meeting with nancy at 7pm today. Or tomorow for breakfast or a quick hello.

Also will be back in DC Friday to do some teaching to doctors.

Thank you again so much.

Be well, mark
