UNGA question:
 What is timing for POTUS meetings w Israel and PA?
 Am I going to the deforestation mtg? If not, can Todd go?

Do we know yet if there will be an ASEAN-US Summit while POTUS in Singapore?

I'd like to set up mtg w John Kerry for week after UNGA. Offer him choice if he wants to come to State but make clear I
will come to meet him at his office or other place of his choosing.

Also, how are we doing w Durbin mtg--I owe him one and not sure I can wait for larger Reid/Pelosi mtg.

There is a Dec 11 mtg in Costa Rico which I may want to attend as part of the larger Latin Am trip.
