No — I wasn't invited to this. I can't anyway — I need to go over to USAID for an event we're hosting w/
IFPRI. S/P recently drafted a policy paper on Africa and I worked contributed a lot to that paper. I see one big
issue missing from those questions —the issue of China in Africa. China is transforming the continent in a way
not seen since the days of colonialism.
        We should also think about China in the context of food security. There are one million Chinese
farmers currently working in Africa! That's remarkable if you think about it. China has also bought nearly 3
million hectares of land in Africa and could become one of the largest sources of commercial farming on the
continent. They are also building many of the roads that will transform transportation and the movement of
agriculture products.
