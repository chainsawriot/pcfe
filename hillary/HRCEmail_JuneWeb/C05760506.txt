Hi hillary,



I trust I am not violating a protocol, but word has it that the israeli ambassador has been trying to meet with you to no
avail. I wanted to make sure you knew that was a belief being shared. I can't imagine why your folks would want to keep
you two apart. I hear he is solid. So, that's the heads up. I am always available if there is a problem with which I can be
helpful. Btw,                  news. All the best, bg
