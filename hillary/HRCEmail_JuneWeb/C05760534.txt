We've sent word that she's going to call (I think Davu is in Slovenia but should be available). I think we've got
agreement on the text after another word change or two, and Davu will know that the key issue is agreeing on a date for
a signing and submission to parliaments. We've told the Turks that it "should be" in early October. They will push back,
and if they agree to a date at all it will probably be Oct 12. That will be much harder to sell to other side, but our
minimum need is a date at least by then. Thanks.

Huma â€” I have asked the Swiss FM to make a run at Davu first, and if that fails we may need HRC. OK? Call me if you
want to discuss.

Huma:

For the Davutoglu call, here is a copy of the text the Turks (Davutoglu) have agreed to release tomorrow, if the
Armenians agree. And as noted in the call sheet, they will only agree if Turkey agrees on a date in advance of Oct. 14 for
the signature of the documents. Let me know if any questions.

Phil
