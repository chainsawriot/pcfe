I saw the piece yesterday and had stuck in yours today. But they should have identified it as NY Magazine, Not NY Times

Good piece though. Accompanied by a great photo of you and the President outside the mosque

Did you see the article by him attributed to the NYTimes Magazine. Did it run in the paper version?
