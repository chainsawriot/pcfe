Bill Clinton to visit Haiti Monday as UN special envoy
07/02/2009 16:58

UNITED NATIONS, July 2, 2009 (AFP) - Former US president Bill Clinton will travel to Haiti Monday for his first visit as UN
special envoy to the Caribbean nation, the world body announced Thursday.

Clinton, who was appointed to the post by UN chief Ban Ki-moon last month, is to confer with government officials
"about how to best support the efforts to prepare for hurricanes, generate new jobs and enhance the delivery of basic
social services," UN spokeswoman Michele Montas told reporters.

The former US president "will also focus on how to ensure that the United Nations, civil society and the donor
community align their activities with the government's recovery plan as well as with each other," she added.

It will be Clinton's his second trip to Haiti this year.

In March, he and Ban toured Haiti together and urged the international community to continue to aid the impoverished
Caribbean country.

Clinton, who visited Haiti while president in 1995, was the first US leader to travel to the country while in office since
Franklin Roosevelt in 1934.

The former US president has sought to focus world attention on Haiti which was devastated by hurricanes last year and
is the poorest country in the western hemisphere.
