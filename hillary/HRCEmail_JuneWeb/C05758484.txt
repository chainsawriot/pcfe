Subject:                            Followup



Here's a partial list of followup from our last trip and the last week:

What can we do to help protect the Christians in Iraq as requested by Ken Joseph whom we saw in Baghdad?

JoDee Winterhof raised questions about how the PRTs and the language DOD uses about them are problematic for
NGOs like care.

Pls ask one of Holbrooke's people if they ever talked to Wolfgang Danspeckgruber at Princeton about building a railroad
in Aghanistan.

Also Dr. Arthur Keys at International Relief + Development wanted to talk w someone from Holbrooke's team about
development in Af.

I asked the Spec IG for Af Recon, Arnold Fields, to alert us to problems as soon as they can. I'm not sure how to formalize
this or even if it's appropriate. Let's discuss.

What are the "Iran Watchers"?
