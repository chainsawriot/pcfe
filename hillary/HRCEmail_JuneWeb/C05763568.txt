Subject: Honduras asks us to co-sponsor GA resolution for tomorrow's session

Sir:


10 received and disseminated the draft Honduras GA resolution, which Honduras has asked us to co-sponsor, this
evening. President Zelaya addresses the General Assembly tomorrow morning at 11:00 am, so USUN needs to be
instructed this evening.


The bureaus are happy to co-sponsor, as long as the resolution stays substantively the same. The draft text is below:

Begin Draft Text

DRAFT RESOLUTION UNDER ITEM 20 OF THE AGENDA: CONCERNING THE SITUATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND
PROGRESS TOWARD A REGION OF PEACE, DEMOCRACY AND DEVELOPMENT

The General Assembly, concerned by the political and social events since June 28, 2009 in the Republic of Honduras;


Recalling the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter, the OAS Charter, and the Inter-American
Democratic Charter;

Deeply concerned by the unconstitutional alteration of the democratic order, which has endangered security,
democracy and rule of law, and jeopardized the safety of Honduran citizens and foreigners;

                                                    111

1. Condemns the breaking of constitutional order in Honduras and the overthrow of the democratically elected
President Don Jose Manuel Zelaya Rosales,

2. Demands the restoration of President Jose Manuel Zelaya Rosales to his constitutional duties so that he may fulfill
the mandate for which he was elected by the Honduran population,

3. Refuses to recognize any Government of Honduras other than the constitutionally legitimate government of
President Zelaya.

4. Requests the Secretary-General inform the General Assembly on the progress of events in that country.

Is it okay to co-sponsor the GA resolution?

The State bureaus are going to defer to USUN about whether we should announce that we are co-sponsors



                                             Please let me know if you have an opinion on whether we should
announce our co-sponsorship in advance and I can share with 10/USUN.

Thanks,

Madeeha
