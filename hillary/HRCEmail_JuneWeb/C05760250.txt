Ok. And, by the way,                     We'll celebrate in December.

I ran into Charlie in NY this week. He talked about his upcoming interview with you. He said he wanted to focus a lot on
China. That he will be in Berlin will help focus him, too, on the transatlantic relationship, which I would also bring up if he
doesn't. Sid
