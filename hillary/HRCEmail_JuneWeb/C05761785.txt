Just FYI that Betsy and Tom are coming to State today for a tour of the Diplomatic Reception Rooms. (Betsy may have
her boss in tow, too). Marcee Craighill is going to give them a private tour at 2:00 PM, and afterward I will show them
whatever I can on the 7th floor.

Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton
