To All:

Tom wanted you to know that he and Hector Morales just departed Jamaica after meeting with Caribbean foreign
ministers. Three main points:

--The Caribbean FMs welcomed discussion with Tom about the Caribbean security dialogue. Tom told them we would
go into more detail at the May 20 experts meeting in Suriname.

--The FMs look forward to meeting with S in San Pedro Sula at the OASGA.

--On Cuba, the FMs expressed sympathy with what we are trying to do, but want to hear more about next steps.

Best,

ck
