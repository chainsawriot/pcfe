Subject:                           Call with Sen. Lautenberg



I spoke w the Senator who is not ready to lift his hold yet. He spoke w the Charge in the Brazilian Embassy who told him
there was a procedure in the Brazilian courts that could be used to give Mr. Goldman custody now and during the
remaining time of the court proceedings.

Craig, can you find out what the Brazilians meant by that and if their govt is pursuing it?

Bob, can you and USTR contact your Brazilian counterparts to explain how important the Goldman case is to the Senator
who can't understand how the father wins every case but never gets his son back and he has run out of patience and is
willing to hold this critical bill.

Let me know what you find out. Thanks.
