Subject: Zelaya Update

I have been chasing Zelaya by phone all around the Mayflower Hotel. I have spoken with the Honduran PermRep, the
Honduran FonMin, and the Venezuelen FonMin. Hector has spoken to Insulza. Everybody knows why we are calling.
Zelaya is obviously trying to work out his position before he gets back to me. He is at breakfast meeting now with
Argentine, Ecuadoran,and Paraguayan presidents, the UNGA president, the Vens, and Insulza.
