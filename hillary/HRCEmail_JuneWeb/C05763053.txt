Subject: RE: Honduran President Zelaya Reportedly Seized by Armed Forces

I am in the office and working with our Embassy in Tegucigalpa. Apparently, the action this morning was a coordinated
effort by the Supreme Court, the Honduran Congress, and the armed forces to prevent President Zelaya from holding a
non-binding poll on a possible constituent assembly. The Supreme Court determined the poll illegal and ordered the
military to collect all balloting materials. In the process of doing this, the military also seized Zelaya and supposedly sent
him by aircraft to Costa Rica.

Our Ambassador has his Emergency Action Committee convened at the Embassy. They are reaching out to all their
contacts to determine the current state of play. The Embassy will issue a warden message soon to U.S. citizens in
Honduras regarding events. I have called our Embassy in Costa Rica and asked it to confirm Zelaya's presence in San     â€¢
Jose. I will be calling the Costa Rican Foreign Minister soon. Tomorrow, Costa Rica takes over as President Pro Temp of
the Central American Integration System.

Hector Morales has been in touch with OAS SecGen Insulza. The OAS Permanent Council passed a resolution on Friday
offering its good offices to Honduras to resolve the political impasse, and Insulza was going to lead a team to Honduras
on Monday. We are checking to determine the state of play of the delegation, but OAS involvement will be key to a
successful resolution of this event.

I will also be calling the new SouthCom Commander to ensure a coordinated U.S. approach. We have big military
equities in Honduras through Joint Task Force Bravo at Soto Cano airbase.

We are working up press points now. Although this morning's events were part of a larger political and institutional
struggle in Honduras. The seizure and expulsion of the President was an intolerable act by the armed forces and we are
going to have to say this loud and clear.

According to conversations between A/S Shannon and the Honduran Ambassador, shots were fired outside of
President Zelaya's residence in Tegucigalpa, and members of the armed forces have reportedly seized the
President. U.S. Ambassador Llorens has received the same report in conversations with Zelaya's personal
secretary. Embassy Tegucigalpa is convening their EAC.
