            16         Congress makes the following findings:
             17             (1) Poverty and hunger, lack of opportunity,
             18        gender inequality, and environmental degradation
             19        are recognized as significant contributors to socio-

             4              (3) The bipartisan Final Report of the National
             5        Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United
             6        States (9/11 Commission Report) recommends, "A
             7        comprehensive United States strategy to counter ter-
             8        rorism should include. economic policies that encour-

            10        nities for people to improve the lives of their families
            11        and enhance prospects for their children.".
            12              (4) The alleviation of poverty and hunger is in
            13        the national interest of the United States. It im-
            14        proves United States security by mitigating the un-

              4       tering peace and cooperation between all nations.
              5             (6) Currently the global development policies
              6       and programs of the United States Government are
              7       scattered across 12 different Federal departments,
              8        25 different Federal agencies, and nearly 60 Federal
              9        Government offices. The current law governing for-
            10         eign assistance is outdated, cumbersome, and lacks
            11         relevance for modern challenges, articulating at least
            12         140 broad priorities for United States development
            13         efforts, with at least 400 specific directives on how
            14         to implement those broad priorities. Moreover, it al-
            15         lows the budget process to drive priorities, rather
            16         than setting clear priorities that drive resource deci-
             17        sions.
             18             (7) The international and domestic challenges
             19        of the 21st century—including transnational threats
             20        such as economic instability, terrorism, climate
             21       . change, and disease—cannot be met with a foreign
             22        assistance apparatus that was created to confront
             23        the challenges •of the 20th century. The cornerstone
             24        for a new foreign assistance architecture begins with
             25        reform of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 that

              6        sufficient resources and commensurate account- •
              7        ability to achieve key foreign assistance goals.
              8                (8) President Barack Obama has expressed a
              9        commitment to cut extreme poverty and hunger
            10         around the world in half, and to increase the level
            11         of United States foreign assistance to meet that
            12         goal.
            13 SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.
            14         It is the policy of the United States, given the impor-
             15 tance of global prosperity and security to the national in-
            16 terests of the United States, to .promote global develop-
             17 ment and the reduction of poverty and hunger. In support
             18 of this policy, a reform and rebuilding process should be
             19 initiated that will redefine the United States foreign as-
             20 sistance architecture and strengthen the capacity of the
             21 United States Agency for International Development and
             22 related agencies to establish effective development policies
             23 and implement innovative and effective foreign assistance
             24 programs with maximum impact.

             3        (a) SENSE OF CONGRESS ON BUILDING THE POLICY
             4 CAPACITY OF       USAID.—It is the sense of Congress that-
             5              (1) there has been too little emphasis in recent
             6        years in developing the capacity of the Agency to
             7        formulate international development policy and to
             8        integrate important policy initiatives and innovative
             9        policy concepts. into Agency programs and activities;
            10              (2) the Agency should increase its emphasis on
            11        recruiting, hiring, training, and enhancing profes-
            12        sional officers who will support the Agency's role in
            13        formulating development policy and enhancing inno-
            14        v.ative solutions to development challenges;
            15.             (3) there is a particular need to strengthen pol-
            16        icy formulation and development in missions world-
            17        wide, in addition to strengthening the capacity of the
            18        Agency to address policy issues in headquarters in
            19        Washington, District of Columbia, which should be
            20        dealt with by deploying policy officers to missions
            21        worldwide; and
            22              (4) a Bureau for Policy and Strategic Planning
            23        should ensure that policy concepts and priorities are
            24        appropriately integrated into all programs and ac-
            25        tivities undertaken by the Agency.

             9        Report on Foreign Assistance Reform states, "[T]he

            11        ment and humanitarian assistance programs are ei-
            12        ther in disarray or do not exist. Current systems
            13        tend to focus more on outputs, such as counting how
            14        many books are delivered to a school, rather than on
            15•      • outcomes, such as measuring how many children can
            16        actually read. Indeed, out of 26,285 impact evalua-
            17        tions that USAID conducted between 1996 and
            18        2005, only 30 measured the impact of projects.".
            19              (3) The HELP Commission also recommends
            20        that the United States Government reestablish an
            21        independent Office of Monitoring and Evaluation re-
            22        sponsible for foreign assistance operations and pro-
            23        vide the office with sufficient funding to monitor and
            24        evaluate performance that should be accountable to
            25        Congress and to the executive branch.

              1              (1) The separate account created by Congress
              2        in 1976 to authorize and appropriate funds for all
              3        operating expenses of the United States Agency for
              4•       International Development has been an important
              5        tool to ensure transparency of administrative costs
              6        and accountability of funds.
              7              (2) Funding for the operating expenses of the
              8        Agency has not kept pace with the growth of the
              9        Agency's program funding and the expanded .geo-
            10         graphic and sectoral demands for economic assist-
            11         ance abroad.
            12               (3) As a result, this has caused the Agency in
            13         certain cases to fund selected administrative costs
            14         out of program funds in order to properly admin-
            15         ister, oversee, and implement its prOgrams and ac-
            16         tivities, thus detracting from the goals of increased
            17         transparency and accountability that establishment
            18         of the separate operating expenses account was in-
            19         tended to foster.

            22         noted that "USAID's operating expense account

              2       "Congress has increasingly encouraged the Agency
              3       to use program funds to support certain administra-
             •4       tive costs".
              5             (5) The December 2007 HELP Commission
              6        Report on Foreign Assistance Reform states, "Over
              7        time, the effectiveness of a separate OE budget has
              8        eroded. During the past 30 years, Congress and the
              9        Executive branch have allowed program funds to be
            10         used to pay for the costs of activities once funded
            11:        from the OE account while cutting the OE budget."
            12              (6) The HELP Commission Report also rec-
            13         ommends "[a]bolish[ing] the OE account and
            14         replac[ing] it with a more accurate accounting proc-
            15         ess," arguing that "the USAID OE account no
            16         longer serves a useful purpose" and stating, "While
            17         it might have been constructive in bringing clarity to
            18         the cost of doing business in the 1970s,. another s-ys-
            19         tem should be developed that calculates true admin-
            20         istrative and management expenses, including. those
            21         now funded with program or project funds. This new
            22         system needs to allow administrative expenses to be
            23         properly managed and monitored and needs to en-
             24        sure that Congress receives clear, timely and trans-
             25        parent information regarding these expenditures."
