Isn't a surprise since 5 years ago he removed his brother as official crown prince.
Basically he's not honoring his fathers dying wish but since constitution says it should be son (with brother as option) he
has clear authority to do it. I personally think this shows confidence in his position as he's not worried about an outcry
from his fathers loyalists.
