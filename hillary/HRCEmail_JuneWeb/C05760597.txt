Hi Cheryl,

Josh Kardon here - we "met" via phone during the ill-fated Oregon campaign. In my real life I'm Senator Wyden's Chief of Staff, and
I am attempting to heln             Iget some justice through the Senate Intelligence Committee.
                                             I so I thought I would check in. In a nutshell, Ron is prepared to approach Intel Chair
Feinstein and others to try to make                                                           but this will be a heavy lift. . . and that's
just with the Democrats.

If this is something the Secretary wants to help with, and you need more info, let me know.

Let me know if we can be of assistance on other matters, as well,

Josh
