Cheryl, Jake,
I owe you both an apology. I had a very productive flight (8-10 hours in a darkened quiet cabin is just what I needed) and
finished Les Gelb's book -- it is astonishing how close our analyses are -- he says that foundation of US power is to
catalyze others to get problems solved. HRC wanted me to make the speech harder and I see some very good ways to do
that -- talking about assembling power coalitions to deal w/ troublesome states, a term Les uses.

But I also had a chance to reread the frame that you put together, much more carefully. There are a number of very
good things in it that I am going to try to work into a revision, or at least flag for how we can build off of this speech in
subsequent speeches. I am sorry that I didn't see that in the press of trying to get to this point.

I will have a revision by Sunday afternoon China time, which would allow her and you to see it Sunday morning.

AMS:

This document is the latest iteration I understand from Justin (who works at Chappaqua). I also understand that last
night she was making changes to it but Justin did not get them so they may not be reflected in this draft.
