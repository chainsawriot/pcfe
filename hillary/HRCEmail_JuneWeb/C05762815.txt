Hi Huma.â€” could you please show this to the Secretary? Senator Reid's staff and Senator Lautenberg would like the
letter below sent to his office today. Upon receipt of the letter, we are told Senator Lautenberg will lift his hold on the
GSP and ATPDA trade legislation. I know the Secretary would prefer to wait until there is a final decision in Brazil, but it
is still unclear when that decision will come (may not even be today) and we have drafted the letter so that it still makes
sense regardless of how and when the court rules. Thanks, and I'm at my desk if she wants to discuss it further. Rich

Dear Senator Lautenberg,

I appreciated the opportunity to speak with you this past weekend regarding the custody case of Sean Goldman, the
young American boy wrongfully detained in Brazil for more than five years. As we discussed, the Administration has
long maintained that Sean should be reunited with his father David in New Jersey. I have made a point of emphasizing
this position with Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim during our many conversations, as have other U.S. Officials
with their Brazilian counterparts.

We have worked closely with the Government of Brazil to ensure it upholds its obligations under the Hague Convention
on International Child Abduction. We were quite concerned by last week's decision suspending the order reuniting Sean
with his father. We were encouraged, however, by the appeal filed last Friday by the Brazilian Solicitor General which
challenges this suspension. Like you, we are eager to learn of the outcome of this appeal. We understand a decision
could be announced shortly.

    You can be assured that we will continue advocating for the reunification of Sean and his father and pressing the
Government of Brazil to ensure swift consideration of the Goldman case so that this long legal process may reach a final
conclusion without further delay. In the meantime, please be assured that the State Department as well as the U.S.
Embassy in Brasilia has been and will continue to be a resource to the Goldman family during this trying time.
