I talked with Mary Beth Sheridan. This is actually a pretty good story. The thrust of the piece is that there is a great deal
of concern about growing Iranian influence in Latin America — talk of investments, projects and so forth — but so far very
little has actually appeared. In other words, the Iranians are talking a good game but not delivering. It is within this
context that Mary Beth picked up on the comment by the Secretary of this large embassy in Manangua that
It turns out is not under construction, at least not yet.

On the record, I said that the Secretary picked this up from one of her counterparts from the region during a bilateral. If
it turns out that is not happening, that's good news. The Iranians see themselves as the big winners in the second Gulf
War. They are trying to extend their influence, particularly in their own region, but elsewhere where they see possible
openings. But while they are trying to buy friends and influence people around the world, the results are clearly mixed.

The story will probably run Sunday.
