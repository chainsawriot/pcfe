Subject: Some intel for you...

This is about Sri Lankan Govt and the Tigers...

I have a good source.

This was shared to me at my and Karen's Derby Party yesterday (can you believe the 50 to 1 odds winner?).

There was a meeting held with Geitner asked for and led by IMF... They told him you were intruding into his domain by
ordering/telling IMF to suspend funding to Sri Lakan Govt.

My take is that the people on the ground both with World Bank and IMF believe the Tigers need to be completely
defeated and any collateral damage inflicted on private people by SL govt in process is ok... They also believe Tigers are
better at propaganda than SL govt...

I have no idea what reality is... I know all about the conflict because there's been so much written over time but no idea
of reality on ground.



My point is that IMF/World Bank is hoping to get Geitner to intervene and they recently played to his sense of who is US
point person on IMF... So, that's what I know. I'll keep my ears open.
