Hillary: In Rome, on way to Florence to NYU Center on Law and Security

Conference. Here's the point: While here, I had dinner tonight with Shaun

Woodward (meeting with Pope on N. Ireland). He told me he's meeting with Jim

Steinberg on Friday. He told me things you would in my judgment want and need to

hear because they will likely involve your personal role. I think you should

step in and ask him to tell you directly. I also should relate to you when I

return information about Brown government re foreign ministry: Meetings here

with former PM Amato, former amb. Saleo, key journalists for Correire,

Repubblica, Europa, RAI, etc, new re Berlusconi, as usual the real story is not

what's public. Sid
