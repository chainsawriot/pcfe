Yep - especially certain Fox personalities. I went to college with O'Reilly.                    As for 'media' debuts, I
responded to an invitation to submit a piece to the Washington Post. Not sure if it is a gimmick or not, but submitted
anyway. Wrote about encountering 5 young Obama supporters in NH while campaigning for you. The piece wonders
where the youthful optimism of the Obama mobilization is today. Anyway, attached it. All the best, Marty

troop needs. Spoke with Hank yesterday. He was characteristically a 'cool hand' this morning in what I think was his
national media 'debut'. Hope all is well. Best, Marty
