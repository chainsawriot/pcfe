Dear Madeleine,

 Thank you for your letter report to me about the excellent work you are doing. All the outreach is reassuring the
Central and Eastern members. We face some hard choices ahead and should plan to meet in December to review. I will
be in Brussels for the NATO Ministerial the first week, so let's aim for a time after that.

 All the best, Hillary
