Dear Melanne,

      UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759606 Date: 06/30/2015

The US Ambassador to UNESCO is launching a fierce, ferocious, unfair campaign against the Egyptian candidate to
UNESCO Minister Farouk Hosni.

If Washington does not want him — for whatever reasons — this is acceptable as their choice, but we think the US, with
its principles and weight, should be a fair partner and an objective leader.

People here are surprised at the position of the US Ambassador. They say "We want to feel that change is not just a
Motto but starts a new era in our relationship"




Hosni is an open-minded person who respects all religions. He is accused of being Anti-Jewish. That is not true. The
allegation is based on a quote out of context. He is translating Hebrew literature, restored Synagogues and is
establishing a Jewish Museum. He rescued the torah scrolls and has the symbols of the three religions appear together
in Video Clips, Pictures and documentaries about Egypt.




For these, and similar reasons, the fundamental — Terrorists are against him and are the ones working hard to block his
election.

Who wants to be with them in the same basket!!!!
