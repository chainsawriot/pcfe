 Statement from President on the situation in Honduras

  "I am deeply concerned by reports coming out of Honduras regarding the detention and expulsion of President Mel
â€¢ Zelaya. As the Organization of American States did on Friday, I call on all political and social actors in Honduras to
  respect democratic norms, the rule of law and the tenets of the Inter-American Democratic Charter. Any existing
