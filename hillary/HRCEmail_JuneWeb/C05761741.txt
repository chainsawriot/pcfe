     The Secretary's Phone Calls with Japanese, ROK, Chinese and Russian
                              Foreign Ministers
                                                   Classified by DAS, A/GIS, DoS on 06/30/2015 —
                            Monday, May 25, 2009 Class: CONFIDENTIAL — Reason: 1.4(B), 1.4(D)
                                                               — Declassify on: 05/24/2024
 Purpose: To reach out to Japan, South Korea, China and Russia following the
 probable May 24 DPRK nuclear test.

     • A nuclear test by North Korea, if confirmed, would be a provocative act and
       an unequivocal violation of UNSCR 1718, blatantly disregarding the will of
       the international community.

     • We have remained united in the face of the DPRK's provocations, and we
       need to maintain this unity among the Six-Party partners. The DPRK's
       message to us in advance of the test, which blamed the UNSC's "failure to
       apologize for its Presidential Statement," demonstrates the degree to which
       the DPRK has isolated itself. Now is the right time for a Five-Party meeting
       to demonstrate our unity.

     • It is essential that the UN Security Council take strong measures to clearly
       demonstrate that the DPRK's actions will have consequences. The United
       States believes that it is essential that the Security Council issue a swift
       statement condemning the DPRK's test at its initial May 25 emergency
       meeting. The UNSC should then quickly follow up with a strong new
       Chapter 7 Resolution that includes concrete response measures.

        [FOR TOKYO AND SEOUL] The United States remains committed to the
        nuclear umbrella and its obligations under the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual
        Cooperation and Security and the U.S.-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty.

                                                                                             1.4( B)
