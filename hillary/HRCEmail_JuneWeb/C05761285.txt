Because of the way you rejiggered the day, I should go from the WH across the street to ND event. And then I wiull go
home. Can you tell them I will leave mtg as soon as it ends and come right over?
Can you ask Kris B to meet me there--he knows some of the people like Joe Loughey(?) Head of Cummins. Thx.
