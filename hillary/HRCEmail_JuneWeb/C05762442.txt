Times Reporter Held by Taliban Escapes
By THE NEW YORK TIMES

A New York Times reporter who was kidnapped by the Taliban has escaped and made his
way to freedom after more than seven months of captivity in the mountains of Afghanistan
and Pakistan.

David Rohde, along with a local reporter, Tahir Ludin and their driver, Asadullah Mangal,
were abducted outside of Kabul on Nov. 10 while Mr. Rohde was researching a book.

Mr. Rohde was part of the Times reporting team that won a Pulitzer Prize in May for
coverage of Afghanistan and Pakistan last year.

Mr. Rohde told his wife, Kristen Mulvihill, that Mr. Ludin joined him late Friday night in
climbing over the wall of a compound where they were being held in the North Waziristan
region of Pakistan. They found a Pakistani army scout, who led them to a nearby army
base, and on Saturday they were flown to the American Bagram military base in
Afghanistan.

"They just walked over the wall of the compound," said Ms. Muvihill.

Mr. Mangal did not escape with the two other men.

The initial report was that Mr. Rohde was in good health, while Mr. Ludin injured his foot
in the escape.

Until now, the kidnapping has been kept quiet by The Times and other media
organizations out of concern for the men's safety.

"From the early days of this ordeal, the prevailing view among David's family, experts in
kidnapping cases, officials of several governments and others we consulted was that going
public could increase the danger to David and the other hostages. The kidnappers initially
said as much," said Bill Keller, the executive editor of The Times. "We decided to respect
that advice, as we have in other kidnapping cases, and a number of other news
organizations that learned of David's plight have done the same. We are enormously
grateful for their support."

Since the men were abducted, there has been sporadic communication from them and
from the kidnappers.
Ms. Mulvihill expressed relief at the end of the ordeal and gratitude to the many people —
official and unofficial — who offered information, advice and support.

"The family is so grateful to everyone who has helped — the New York Times, the U.S.
government, all the others. Now we just hope to have a chance to reunite with him in
peace," she said.

"We've been married nine months," Ms. Mulvihill added. "And seven of those, David has
been in captivity."
Both Mr. Keller and Mr. Rohde's family declined to discuss details of the efforts to free the
captives, except to say that no ransom money was paid and no Taliban or other prisoners
were released.

"Kidnapping, tragically, is a flourishing industry in much of the world," Mr. Keller said.
"As other victims have told us, discussing your strategy just offers guidance for future
kidnappers."

Mr. Rohde, 41, had traveled to Kabul in early November to work on a book about the
history of American involvement in Afghanistan when he was invited to interview a
Taliban commander. Before setting out, Mr. Rohde instructed The Times's bureau in
Kabul on whom to notify if he did not return. He also indicated that he believed the
interview was important and that he would be all right.

Mr. Rohde joined The Times staff in 1996 after winning a Pulitzer Prize in international
reporting for documenting the massacre of Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica.
