Subject                             Speech



Will call you shortly - my tamn gets in in 15 min.

Remind me to discuss brief filing and speech again -- everyone is going (Gates, Panetta, Napolitano, Holder) except for
Blair. We don't have logically response to why you are not there when asked and team is showing up. Easy box to check
since we don't yet anticipate going to egypt.
