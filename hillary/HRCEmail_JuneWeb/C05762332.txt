My random stuff can wait till the morning:
- talked to           who is back to really wanting an ambassadorship
- mark weiner wants to have a party for capricia, told him we'd love it but after the confirmation and we can do
something nice on 8th floor
                 Vuants to come see u privately this week. He wants to talk to you about iran before he sees biden at a
fundraiser when he's in dc this week.
