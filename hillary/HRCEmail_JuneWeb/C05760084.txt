I'm at a gathering In Italy on Beijing's unfinished agenda with many of your friends -- a group as diverse as Yunus and
Tina Brown. You have gotten so many plaudits for your honest engagement in Pakistan.

I'm sure it brings back many memories to be in Marrekesh. The women in Morocco have achieved a great deal,
especially with the family code reform -- and they have had the support of the King. The gender initiative idea that is
part of the FFF is still unformed. I think if you say positive things about its potential, it could make a difference for how it
goes forward and we can help.

You make us proud.
