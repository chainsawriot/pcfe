                  We are sad to be spreading the news of the passing of Marion Sinek, beloved mother, grandmother, and
friend, and tireless public servant. She believed in the dignity of each human being, respect for all, social justice, and
family.




                The following text is the formal announcement of her passing:




                 Marion Sinek passed away peacefully on August 17, 2009 at age 78 after a long illness. She was born in
Berlin, Germany, and came to the US just before the beginning of WWII. She graduated from Forest Hills High School
and Syracuse University on a full scholarship. After graduate work at the London School of Economics, she worked for
Radio Free Europe and the UN Association-USA in NY. Marion became very active in public affairs, serving in various
roles for the League of Women voters, including President of the LWV of NY State. She later ran for office, serving for
eight years as a Town Board member in New Castle before becoming its Supervisor from 2000 to 2004. She later
worked with Sen. Hillary Clinton's office on election law issues, and remained active in Democratic politics and other
organizations. She served on the Compensation Advisory Panel to the Westchester County Board of Legislators, and
served on the boards of The Chappaqua Orchestra and the Holocaust and Human Rights Education Center. She lived in
Chappaqua for almost 38 years. She was predeceased by her husband Herbert; she is survived by her children Ron and
Nicole (Arnaboldi), their spouses Jennifer and Leo, and seven grandchildren. Burial will be private. A memorial will be
held in September. In lieu of flowers, donations in her memory may be made to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center.




                We know you join us in mourning the passing of a wonderful human being.
