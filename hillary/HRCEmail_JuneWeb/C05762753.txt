It may be worth putting together a small group to think through the issue in some depth to decide whether there is a
more proactive strategy that may be possible and/or worth engaging in one or more countries :

1. Define human rights challenges around gay communities in many of our partner countries

2. Define the social political context (ie: how does civil society and the political/legislative activity converge or not
converge)

3. Potential role of Judicial response (eg: Adult Disability Act in US)

4. Role of multilateral and normative bodies

We are quietly doing this in PEPFAR over the next two months to assess whether we can work behind the politics to
increase the "safe space" for our populations seeking and/or in care (increase identification, entry and retention).



Cheryl, I hope you have a wonderful holiday, heading back to SF now, back in Monday (28th)

What is the best way to have a systematic assessment of what countries in Africa have laws proceeding or on the books
re: anti-gay measures similar to the Uganda bill?




I am particularly concerned as we begin to make determinations in budget process for significant investments in several
countries for GHFSI, Pepfar, GHI, etc., that we not be surprised.




Can you advise how we can proceed or if we should do a call or seek a tasking for this information?




Thanks.
