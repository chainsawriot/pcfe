Dear Huma,

It was great to see you today however briefly

Tim Collins just called me after his meeting with Secretary Sebelius tonight and she was interested in what we are trying
to do. Tim suggested it would be helpful if you or the Secretary called to introduce me to her. Then I could set up a
meeting tomorrow while I am still here. I am leaving at 630 pm.. I would really appreciate it â€” I think it could help
move things along!

Be well,

Mark

PS I am on my cell
