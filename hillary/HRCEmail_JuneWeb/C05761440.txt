Subject: Fwd: Thank you for meeting
Dear Hillary,

I met with Zohra Rasekh on Friday. You may remember her. She'd met with you during your trips to Kabul as
Senator. She is an Afghan-American who has been working in Afghanistan over the last six years and is
currently the country's Director of Human Rights. She knows the leaders very well --- and I might add, verifies
what is known about the rampant corruption, etc.
Since you are going to the Hague and since there will be no women from Afghanistan, I asked Zohra to give me
her assessment. Her comments reinforce what I heard from several other Afghan women leaders who were in
DC over the last week. I hope this is useful.

Senate willing, hopefully I'll be able to get to work soon.
Safe travels,
Melanne

 Subj: Thank you for meeting

 Dear Ms. Verveer,

 It was great to see you last Friday, I thank you for meeting with me in this busy time. Once
 again, I congrtulate you on your appointment in State Dept. I was thrilled to learn that someone
 with your expertise and commitment will be in charge of this challenging job. The Secretary of
 State has made a great choice and I know with your leadership, the women issues around the
 world, in particular in Afghanistan, will be addressed and attended loudly and more effectively
 by the new administration.

 As I mentioned I have drafted a policy brief paper which I would have liked to share with you.
                                                              I wasn't able to finalize it as
 planned before my depature. Attached is a few urgent issues about women that could be raised
 in the Haag conference. It is for your information to raise with Secretary Clinton. I will send
 you a final version once I get to Kabul. I am leaving today for Kabul, but will be in touch with
 you through email.

 Many thanks,
