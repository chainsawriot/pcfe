        I enjoyed the opportunity to discuss the emerging potential that Haiti presents with the Secretary of State and
former President Clinton last night. I would like to take this opportunity to make a brief suggestion for Thursday's trip to

large scale job creation, for example through direct involvement of OPIC. In my report I pointed out that the port in Port-
au-Prince is the most expensive port in the Caribbean and recommended the opening of new private ports. Ports

how central well-functioning, competitive ports are to attract foreign investors as part of the HOPEI! window and to put
the right transport infrastructure in place.
