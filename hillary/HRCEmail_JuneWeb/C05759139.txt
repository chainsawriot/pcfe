Subject: Secretary Clinton Must Focus on Cause of Congo Conflict




Secretary of State Hillary Clinton should focus on the fuel which drives the violence in Congo, the conflict minerals
extracted from the eastern war zone and widely used by our consumer electronics industry. "Clinton's visit to Goma
tomorrow provides the opportunity for the United States to deepen its overdue engagement in search of a solution for
the world's deadliest war," Enough Project co-founder John Prendergast said today.

"Tantalum helps cool cell phones and laptops. Tungsten enables the vibration function in a cell phone. Tin is a solder for
most circuit boards in nearly every electronic product. And gold is used to encase wiring. Until the trade in minerals
becomes legal and transparent, there will be no peace in Congo," Prendergast said.

Clinton earlier highlighted the role of conflict minerals in what she called "the unspeakable violence against women and
girls in eastern Congo."

"It is the worst example of man's inhumanity to women. And women are being used in conflicts. Now, what are the
conflicts about? Well, yes, there are tribal and other reasons why the conflicts are going on, but get below the surface.
It's because there are mines in eastern Congo that produce the minerals that go into our cell phones and our other
electronics. There is a lot of money being made by a lot of people, but it sure isn't helping the people of the DRC,"
Clinton said in an interview in Nairobi.

The majority of sexual violence cases reported in North Kivu since January have been attributed to government soldiers
according to the Congo Advocacy Coalition, a group of 88 humanitarian and human rights organizations, including
Enough Project. Early last month the Congolese Government announced a policy of "zero tolerance" for abuses
committed by army soldiers and said commanders who permit their troops to commit such crimes will be held
responsible but to date, only a handful of officers have been arrested.

"The increase in rape in an area where already so many women and girls have been victims is deplorable," said Olivia
Caeymaex of Enough. "Ending impunity for rape and other serious crimes needs to be at the heart of any strategy to
combat sexual violence. Secretary Clinton should ensure US diplomatic and financial assets are focused on bringing to
justice those who are most responsible."

statement from the Congo Advocacy Coalition


TAKE ACTION:


Secretary Clinton's office has set up a website that will direct texts and emails to her when she's in Africa


TEXT THE SECRETARY on CONGO at 90822
"HELP WOMEN IN CONGO, STOP THE CONFLICT MINERALS TRADE"
Secretary Clinton should champion the conflict minerals legislation to ensure that it's signed into law and and
implemented properly. You can text the message or email here.
<http://capweb.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&c=PRIabT1%2FbpA3qy3oHZF4vGmGnHaKXNYs>


TEXT THE SECRETARY on SUDAN at 90822
"DO NOT END SUDAN SANCTIONS WITHOUT REAL PROGRESS"
At a recent Senate hearing on Sudan, Special Envoy Gration asked for "more space on sanctions" claiming that they were
hindering development in southern Sudan. Congress already took action in 2006 to create significant exceptions for the
south and other marginalized areas of Sudan for development purposes.


We should not roll back the sanctions. We need assurances from Secretary Clinton that the Obama Administration will
support keeping the sanctions in place until the Sudan government fulfills its obligations on the Comprehensive Peace
Agreement and the peace process in Darfur. You can text the message or email here.

Women running from destruction <http://www2.americanprogress.org/images/CongoWomenRunning.jpg>


A woman carrying her child runs for safety from the burning compound of presidential candidate Jean-Pierre Bemba's
bodyguards in Congo's capital, Kinshasa, in July 2006. Congo's largely successful elections in 2006 have not proven to be
a panacea to Congo's ills; 45,000 people die each month, mostly from the crippling effects of widespread conflict in the
Congo's eastern provinces.
