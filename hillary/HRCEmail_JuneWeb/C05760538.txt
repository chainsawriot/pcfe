  Subject:                          Interview



 In thinking about the Kissinger interview, the only issue I think that might be raised is that I see POTUS at least once a
 week while K saw Nixon everyday. Of course, if I were dealing w that POTUS I'd probably camp in his office to prevent
 him from doing something problematic. Do you see this as a problem?
