Yes. There isn't. Ann Manes team brainstormed on ideas for a day long session and celebration but didn't materialize.
We looked into doing something else last week but given the swine flu outbreak, most people were either canceling or
toning down things. Dan Smith said that even the mexican embassy isn't doing what they normally did either.

What happened w our plans for this? There's nothing about it on my schedule so I assume nothing is happening.
