Cherie-

  So sorry I've been slow in responding but I am very interested in talking w the Sheika. I would be happy to host her if
she were to come to DC or meet her in Europe when I'm next there. How do you think I should proceed? All the best,
Hillary

Hilary,

You may know but for the last four years I have been working with the Qatari's and in particular with Sheikha Moser on
disability issues in Qatar and I have built up a good relationship with them

Sheikha Moser has approached me privately saying they are keen to get their relationship with the USA onto a more
positive footing and she was hoping for a "women to women" one to one private meeting with you. She is happy to
come to Washington if you could make some time available.

Is this something you would be prepared o do. Sheikha Moser is someone who has real influence in Qatar and she has
made a lot of difference already with her education city and with the Shaffalah Centre for people with Disabilities in
which I am involved as the Co Chair of its Annual Disability conference. I am sure the conversation would not be
confined to these issues but would be about the US/Qatar relationship generally.
