                                                                                 RELEASE IN FULL
                                Fact Sheet for the Media
                                 Forum for the Future

 The Forum for the Future is a joint initiative of the countries of the Broader Middle
 East and North Africa region (BMENA) and the industrialized countries of the
 Group of Eight (G8). It is a unique partnership between governments of the
 region, the G8, civil society representatives and private sector leaders to discuss
 and exchange ideas on how to best work together to support progress and expand
 opportunities for the people of the region.

 The Forum for the Future was launched at the Sea Island G8 Summit in the United
 States in June, 2004. During this summit, the G8 countries stressed their
 commitment to promote progress in the BMENA region and to help establish an
 environment conducive to an informal, flexible, open and inclusive dialogue. The
 first Forum for the Future was held in Rabat in December 2004, co-hosted by The
 Kingdom of Morocco and the United States.

 In preparation for the 2009 ministerial, co-chairs Morocco and Italy along with
 civil society partners convened three preparatory workshops across the region on:
 economic reform (September 26-27, Beirut, Lebanon, in partnership with the
 Organization for Civil Activities), political reform (October 5-6, Rabat, Morocco,
 in partnership with the Moroccan Organization for Human Rights), and human
 development (October 12-13, Doha, Qatar, in partnership with the National Human
 Rights Committee and the Arab Democracy Foundation).

 The BMENA Initiative complements the objectives outlined by President Obama
 in his Cairo speech and is a natural partner for making progress in key areas â€”
 notably economic opportunity, education, good governance, human rights, and
 women's empowerment. BMENA's emphasis on cooperation among
 governments, civil society and the private sector aligns with the President's vision
 of partnership between the United States and countries in the region. The United
 States will engage with leaders from the region on issues of common interest and
 shared values, working together to infuse new energy into the partnership. In
 particular, we believe our focus should be firmly on developing a path to
 increasing opportunity for the youth of the region.

 The Broader Middle East and North Africa participants include Afghanistan,
 Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman,
 Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, West Bank
 and Gaza, and Yemen.

 The G8 countries include Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the
 United Kingdom, and the United States.
