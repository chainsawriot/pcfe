Subject: GLIFFA Gay Pride Event - Vandalism (proofed and revised)

Attached is the flyer for today's event to be held at noon in the Dean Acheson Auditorium.

Our staff observed to our dismay that during the night or early this morning, someone removed and discarded all of
the flyers for this event which we had placed in elevator wells throughout the building.

We consider this Anti - Gay vandalism, and though not entirely unexpected, it certainly cannot be tolerated.

My staff is in the process of reprinting and distributing the announcements, which are critical to ensure the broadest
possible publicity for attendance. Moreover it is very important that GLIFFA understand the Department of State
supports them as fully as we do all other Affinity Groups. Moreover, we will protect their rights to assembly, free
speech, and freedom from harassment.

We ask that you immediate help in monitoring the elevator wells and other spaces for the next two hours to deter
and discourage vandals. Please have your personnel approach anyone in the act of unauthorized poster removal, and
take any other measures you deem appropriate to deal with this situation.

Thank you for the advice you have already given and thanks in advance for the assistance and support you will render to
address this problem.

John
