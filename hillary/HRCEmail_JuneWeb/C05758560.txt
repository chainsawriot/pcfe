Please advise to whom I should forward Jacqueline Novogratz's request. I know you know her, but honestly, she is so
far ahead of the curve and brilliant. I believe she could be enormously helpful to your work.




Love you,
Jill

Dear Margo and Jill,




I'm writing to see if you might help me secure a meeting with Secretary Clinton to talk about my ideas for a $500 million
Global Innovation Fund that invests in "what works" in international development and would complement the work
President Obama is doing with his domestically-focused Social Innovation Fund.




The world needs a new vision for development. This is the moment for experimentation and a new commitment to
innovation and change. The U.S. spent $23.5 billion on foreign assistance in 2006. If we experimented with just $500
million to invest capital and technical assistance in social enterprises focused on results, accountability and scale, we

could build real blueprints for change. At Acumen Fund we see so many impactful and promising innovations; the State
Department would be a powerful partner in scaling those successes.




A global social innovation fund would be particularly impactful in Pakistan. The U.S. may commit $11.5 billion over five
years to Pakistan, and it is critical that we look closely at how we might spend that money. In Acumen Fund's seven
years working in Pakistan we have found that models for change exist, and we have built a powerful community of
entrepreneurs and supporters within Pakistan. As you know we have invested in organizations like Saiban, which has
provided low-cost housing to more than 60,000. There is FMIA, a joint venture that has sold more than 30,000 health
insurance policies. And Kashf, a microfinance institution serving more than 300,000 poor women by making small loans
to help themselves change their own lives. The challenge is to grow these solutions from reaching hundreds of
thousands to the millions most in need.




I believe this kind of investment in Pakistan is the "smart power" that Secretary Clinton referred to in her speech at the
Global Philanthropy Forum. She has an incredible vision and Acumen Fund would love to find ways to support her.




Anything you could do would be truly appreciated. And do let me know anything I can do on this end as I feel a deep
sense of urgency and want to do all I can to contribute.




Thanks so much,



Jacqueline
