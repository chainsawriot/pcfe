Subject:                          Asian architecture speech



Are we still planning for me to deliver a speech laying out our strategic overview of how we see Asia organized and the
US role in the 21st century in Hawaii on 1/12 on way to Australia and NZ? If so, is there an outline? Will we meet to
discuss early next week?
