On Michael Savage:

Joan wanted everyone to clearly understand before any further discussion occurred with UK that Savage's exclusion
could also have occurred under our legal regime so to the extent we want to suggest to UK that his exclusion on free
speech grounds is inappropriate (or any thing of that like) that we should understand we may appear slightly hypocritical
given our legal regime and actions.

                                                                                                                            B5

Subject: Savage holding pattern and next steps

    This is what L staff, in coordination with EUR, have said to Savage's lawyer:
        â€¢ The demarche was delivered Friday in London, to FCO and Home Office officials. The Embassy
          passed your letter to them, drawing their attention in particular to Mr. Savage's statement that he had
          never advocated violence and that his statements had never instigated violence. The British officials
          said that, given Mr. Savage's legal action in the UK, Treasury solicitors would contact his legal
          representatives directly to provide details of the comments that had given rise to the decision to
          exclude him.
