My guess is that he is calling about Honduras. He, like many other leaders with an interest in Central America, is worried
that Honduras is slipping towards confrontation and violence. He probably does not think Insulza is up to the task. S
should be aware that Arias is prepared to offer his services. I spoke with the Costa Rican FonMin, who said the de facto
government has reached out to Arias, and that the Costa Ricans will be looking for a way to make the offer to Zelaya.
Uribe knows Zelaya and has some influence. Uribe might want to talk with Arias and offer to help move Zelaya in the
right direction. (Although Uribe and Zelaya come from different ends of the political spectrum, they are both ranchers
and love horses, and this has created some comradeship.)
