•    The demarche was delivered Friday in London, to FCO and Home Office officials. The Embassy passed your letter to
them, drawing their attention in particular to Mr. Savage's statement that he had never advocated violence and that his
statements had never instigated violence. The British officials said that, given Mr. Savage's legal action in the UK,
Treasury solicitors would contact his legal representatives directly to provide details of the comments that had given rise
to the decision to exclude him.
