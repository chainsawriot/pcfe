Well he's very young, only 15.
Rumor is hes smart, quiet, bookish. Like his father.
What is interesting is that the reason abdullah gave from removing his brother 5 years ago is that he thought the weight
of being crown prince restricted his life, education and travel. I suspect the reason he's done this is so his son can be
properly groomed from now to inherit the thrown. Life will change dramatically for him.

Isn't a surprise since 5 years ago he removed his brother as official crown prince.
Basically he's not honoring his fathers dying wish but since constitution says it should be son (with brother as option) he
has clear authority to do it.1 personally think this shows confidence in his position as he's not worried about an outcry
from his fathers loyalists.
