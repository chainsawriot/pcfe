Am so glad to hear frm you/Hi knew this was painful combined with logistics of being a woman--know. How streddful
this must be----the other night the. Senate. Women had dinner anyway---all sent good words. And encouragement. To
a woman theyb all said. Oh my imagine just getting dressed and the. Hair thing. Get your therapy. Get better. The
senate is slogging along     health care is starting to sag. --- some days it feels like we are doing the public option off
backof envelope. Call when you can.              X.
