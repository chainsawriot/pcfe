Yes, everything is being readjusted including the personnel meetings. Angolan FM -- yes, I can set that up. And yes,
invited to the Initiative for Global Development but after running the invitation by senior staff here and having a candid
conversation with Suzy George (Albright is not pushing this event), the recommendation was to decline especially given
how hectic this week is going to be.

A few items:

Are you able to move everything from today to later in the week? What about the personnel meetings?

Am I seeing the Angolan FM when he visits May 19-22?

Was I invited by Powell and Albright to attend the Initiative for Global Development event this Wed-Thurs at the Willard
Hotel?
