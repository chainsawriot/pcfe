Dear Cherie--

  I could make time to meet in DC during the weeks of June 8th and 15th. Would that work? I would rearrange my
schedule to fit her time.

 Otherwise, I will be in Trieste, Italy and Corfu, Greece for meetings the last week in June.

 Let me know if this works. Thx and all the best, H

Would you be able to ask Hilary to suggest two dates either in Washington and or Europe in the near future? With the
suggested dates, I can then confirm a meeting.
