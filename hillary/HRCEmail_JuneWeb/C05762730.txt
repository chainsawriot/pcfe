I caught some of the interview and wondered whether it would cause problems. We have to watch this closely.

Would John get that written somewhere?

I'm in the car on my berry if you need me. Thx.

Sorry to bother on the Sunday before Christmas but the Echumenical Patriarch's crowd are extremely worried that he
may get arrested or otherwise harassed/attacked as a result of the 60 Minutes interview he gave which airs tonight.
Thought it was worth passing along and that you might want to get someone to pulse the Emabassy in Turkey.

Hope you are getting a little rest after one hell of a week. Notwithstanding some press whining, I thought BHO and HRC
did a fabulous job in Copenhagen and that the schedule structure has a much better chance of success than sticking with
Kyoto architecture. Congrats to all..

Dear John,
Thank you for responding to me re:the safety of the EP. Unfortunately, the 60 minutes interview has been raising
jingoistic fervor in Turkey. As I told you, the Foreign Ministry called HAH on Friday to express their dismay and concern
that He was disparaging Turkey in such a public manner. Of course, HAH expressed His love for His country, Turkey, but
reiterated the painful, laundry list of issues faced by the Greek Orthodox Christian minority. Today, many of the news
outlets in Turkey are attacking HAH saying that He has condemned Turkey's good name. One of the nationalist papers
called HAH crazy and pictured Him hanging from a cross. (see attachment) The Foreign Ministries said, acourse, that
he was sure the EP made "a slip of the tongue."
Our concern is that some nationalists will attempt to do damage to the Patriarchate or, ever worse some nut from the
Grey wolves will be let loose to hurt/kill HAH. Of course, the Government may over react once they see the full
interview. It is an honest piece of journalism - but very very tough "to face the country in the mirror". Sadly, some
Greek Nationalists fan the flames from their side as well.
I am also sending you a blog<http://www.cbsnews.com/8618-18560_162-
5990771.html?assetTypeld=58&messageld=8825797>which shows some of the the lunacy out there on this issue.
Fortunately, we have good friends like you and an Administration that believes in human rights, religious freedom, civil
rights and dignity of every individual. Above all, we believe in, and glorify, the manager-born Messiah whose message of
good will amongst women and men is best expressed in social/divine justice for everyone.
Thank you
Father Alex â€¢
