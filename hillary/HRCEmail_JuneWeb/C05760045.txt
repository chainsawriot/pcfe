  The Secretary's Call Sheet for
  Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari

  Purpose of Call: To express your condolences regarding the deaths of Iraqi MFA personnel in the August 19 attack on
  the Iraqi Foreign Ministry.

     want to personally express my heartfelt condolences to you for the savage attack on the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign
  Affairs today and for the tragic loss of so many Iraqi lives around Baghdad and particularly at the Ministry of Foreign
  Affairs.

  El I remember fondly our meeting at the MFA in April — I was proud to be the first senior U.S. official to attend a meeting
  there, and I was deeply saddened to hear that your Ministry was attacked.

  CI This is a trying day for Iraqis and the Government of Iraq, but brutal attacks like these only deepen the need for
  dedicated Iraqi like you and those in your Ministry, to remain committed to the new Iraq.

  0 Know that the United States will continue to stand by Iraq as it faces these challenges.

  Background: On Wednesday, August 19, what appears to be a series of VBIED and additional rocket attacks in Baghdad
  resulted in the bloodiest day in Baghdad since the June 30 withdrawal of U.S. forces from urban areas. Although exact
  numbers have not been confirmed, media is reporting that approximately 75 people were killed across Baghdad with
  over 100 injuries. The most devastating attack appears to have been against the Iraqi MFA, where a VBIED was
  exploded in front of the main gate. Zebari's Chief of Staff estimated that there were 35-40 fatalities and up to 40
  injuries resulting from this attack, with 70% of the building damaged. In April, you were the first senior U.S. official to
  hold a meeting at the MFA. Deputy Foreign Minister Labid Abbawi, who attended your meeting at the MFA and who's
  wife led your meeting with Iraqi war widows, was reportedly slightly injured and quite shaken by the attack. He may
  have lost a number of staff members. At this point, we do not know if other senior-ranking MFA officials were killed or
  wounded in the attack.
