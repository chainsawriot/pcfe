Talked to Sen Schumer. Told him I'm glad to raise in Moscow, and will let him know how it goes. I'm familiar with Bank of
NY case from my time as ambassador, and talked to BoNY President last week. Have a good weekend. Bill

Chuck schumer called me cause he's been playing phone tag with hrc. He wanted to talk to her about the problem the
bank of ny is having in russia. He didn't realize she wasn't going. When I told him she wasn't, he said he wanted to talk to
Bill and ask you to raise this issue with russian officials. Bill, are you able to call him and I will tell hrc you are calling
back? Cell is                  or ops can reach him.
