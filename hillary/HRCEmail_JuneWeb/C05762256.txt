Subject: Philippine Burma Statement

Ops - Following Secretary Clinton's call on Saturday, May 16, Philippine Foreign Secretary Alberto Romulo had the
Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) issue the following statement on Sunday, May 17. The statement is on the
Philippine DFA website. Much appreciated if you would inform S staff and other appropriate folk:

Philippine Statement:

The Philippine Government is deeply troubled and outraged over the filing of trumped up charges against Daw Aung San
Suu Kyi and her transfer to Insein prison, particularly when concerns have been raised regarding her health condition.

These recent incidents will surely impede the process of national reconciliation and the Roadmap to Democracy in
Myanmar.

We urge the government of Myanmar to resolve the matter speedily, and to release Aung San Suu Kyi immediately and
unconditionally.

Regards


                                                           17
