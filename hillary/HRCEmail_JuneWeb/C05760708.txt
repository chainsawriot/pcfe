Subject: Note to S on Summit Preparation

Dear Cheryl and Jake,
         Attached pse find my additions to the memo that Tom and Jeff sent on Friday afternoon. They have not had a
chance to go over this — I sent it a couple of hours ago but I'm hoping people have better things to do on Sunday
afternoon. I don't think there is anything I added that they would disagree w/ so propose that this go to S tonight.
         AM
