Nora,

Just to close the loop, I did meet w/ Jeffrey Romoff and his team on Wed
afternoon. They gave a very impressive into on what the University
Medical Center of Pittsburgh (UPMC) is doing in Southern Italy. They are
already getting a lot of political support from our Emb in Rome and are
grateful for it.

I gave them some practical suggestions on other levers in the USG that
they could pull (TDA, OPIC, Commerce Advocacy Center).

They want the Secretary will make some positive reference to Berlusconi in
Italy this summer of their interest in working the GOI to build a
lab/production facility for developing vaccines for H1N1 and other
infectious diseases. They also note the coincidence of the G20 mtng in
Pittsburgh later this summer. I made no commitment. But I do believe this
is a genuinely positive program and our Emb agrees.

I did pass their materials to David Thorne and urged him to be in
touch. He said he would engage, once/if he is confirmed.

Stu

I believe the UPMC's goal is to have some help with the Italians in achieving funding for a project in PA. But all the
background I know is below in my first email.

Thanks Nora. I'm now in touch w/ Leslie and we'll work something out for

Do you have any insight into his objectives for the mtng?

Hi Phil. How are you?

The Secretary is hoping you can schedule a meeting with the President of the University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center. He is working on a project with the Italians and is seeking some guidance. I included some background below.
Please let me know if you are available for a meeting and I'll connect you with them. Thanks!



    • UPMC's Relationship with Italy:

UPMC has a long and successful track record in Italy. More than a decade ago, UPMC entered into a public-
private partnership in Italy, and in collaboration with the region of Sicily and two existing
hospitals, established a major transplant and specialty care hospital. The construction of the
                                                             18

facility, ("ISMETT") was funded by the government and UPMC , which oversaw the
construction and continues to manage it. It has been a great success - bringing transplantation and
specialized services to Sicily, reducing costs to the nation of "exporting" patients who need transplants, and as
an economic driver for the region. Based on the success of ISMETT, UPMC is now working with
the Italian government and an alliance of educational institutions to construct RIMED, a Biomedical Research
and Biotechnology Center (BRBC) outside of Palermo, which will focus on sparking a
biotechnology/regenerative medicine sector in the region. (Please see attached RiMED document.) The
government has appropriated 330 million Euros for this initiative. Further, UPMC is a consultant to the Italian
Government and is in negotiations with the regional governments in Milan and Florence. Our international
offices are in Rome.


   • UPMC's Relationship with Prime Minister Berlusconi:

(a.) UPMC has had a long term and stable relationship in Italy over the past ten years, including two
governments led by Prime Minister Berlusconi. He is knowledgeable about UPMC, as is Giarmi Letta, Italian
Council of Ministry Under Secretary.
(b.) The RiMED initiative was conceived during his previous term of office and in 2005, the letter of intent for
RiMED was personally signed by Prime Minister Berlusconi and Mr. Jeffrey A. Romoff, President of UPMC.
(c.) It was under the Berlusconi administration that the decision was made to fund RiMED and 330 million
Euros were appropriated for this purpose. Mr. Romoff participated in a press conference at Palazzo Chigi
with the Prime Minister.
(d.) Recently, because of the devastating earthquake and the economic downturn, the resources to fund
RiMED have become constrained, but it is felt this is simply an issue of an unexpected contingency, rather than
any lack of interest and support.
(e.) Mr. Romoff has met with Prime Minister Berlusconi several times and is fluent in Italian.
(f .) Many of the significant political figures in Sicily are very closely associated with the Prime Minister and
his party and the importance of UPMC to the Region and potentially to Italy is reinforced.




   • UPMC's Proposed 21CB:

We are   pursuing funding for a flexible, multi-product biologics facility in Southwestern PA, to develop and
manufacture vaccines and therapeutic drugs as a defense against our nation's gravest threat: the Pandemic
spread of diseases and diseases used by bioterrorists as weapons of mass destruction. Thanks
to the tremendous help from our partners, Governor Rendell and Senator Arlen Specter, we have garnered
wide spread support from many across the executive Branch and Congress including Vice President Biden and
HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. We will have the opportunity to brief DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano on
June 15th. The economic impact to the region would be unparalleled, resulting in approximately 1000 direct
jobs and up to 6000 indirect jobs, all the while reducing production costs to the U. S. Government by 80
%. (Please see attached 21st Century Biodefense document.)


   • UPMC's Proposal for the Italian Government:

     UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762435 Date: 06/30/2015




Prime Minister Berlusconi is very much tied to the American agenda and would likely be interested in
developing and funding a companion vaccine manufacturing facility- (600 million Euros,) under UPMC
management, which would serve not only to enhance the strategic defense relationship between Italy and the
United States, but also demonstrate that the Prime Minister is responsive to the increasing public concern
regarding H1N1. It can be an economic driver to both countries, as well. Italy has close ties in the
Mediterranean basin and northern Africa, in particular, and producing vaccines for these countries is desirable
in keeping with the new US. Global Health Care Initiative. Thus, for both substantive and strategic/political
reasons, the 21CB vaccine facility should be exceedingly attractive to Italy.

As importantly, the economic gains for UPMC and the western region of Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh) are
very significant. As the largest employer in western Pa. , the Region depends on UPMC's
economic vitality. Excess revenue (profits) gained from exporting the intellectual and managerial capital
cultivated and developed in Pittsburgh to Italy and abroad, serve to create jobs and growth at home. Given
the unique expertise of UPMC and the international focus on health care reform, this is potentially a multi-
billion dollar export industry bring both funds and prestige to the United States.
