 CA/OCS and EAP/K held a one-hour conference call today with the families of the detained journalists. During
 the call, we briefed the families on the Swedish Ambassador's consular visit with Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee on May
 15;                                                                       recent progress on efforts to arrange
 the release of the two women; an update on the proposed letter from the Secretary;                              1.4(B)
                                                                                                                 1.4(D)
                                                                                                                 B1

 Media: Although the families have thus far shown restraint from approaching the media to publicize their
 story, they are increasingly anxious in response to the DPRK's announcement of a June 4 trial date. They now
 feel that a media appeal is necessary and would be helpful to their case, citing the public attention given the
 Saberi case. They are considering doing interviews on Larry King Live and/or The O'Reilly Factor.                           1.4(D)
                                                                                                                             B1
