Hilary,

You may know but for the last four years I have been working with the Qatari's and in particular with Sheikha Moser on
disability issues in Qatar and I have built up a good relationship with them

Sheikha Moser has approached me privately saying they are keen to get their relationship with the USA onto a more
positive footing and she was hoping for a "women-to women" one to one private meeting with you. She is happy to
come to Washington if you could make some time available.

Is this something you would be prepared o do. Sheikha Moser is someone who has real influence in Qatar and she has
made a lot of difference already with her education city and with the Shaffalah Centre for people with Disabilities in
which I am involved as the Co Chair of its Annual Disability conference. I am sure the conversation would not be
confined to these issues but would be about the US/Qatar relationship generally.
