Wendy--


 Thanks for your good wishes. I am finally on the mend and starting physical therapy. One word of advice--watch where
you step!

  I was very excited by the announced merger w Sandy's firm which sounds like a win-win for all.

 I miss seeing you and hope we can remedy that soon. Happy 4th!

Hope you came through the surgery well and will somehow find five minutes for recovery! Feel better soon. Wendy
