Sid,
Could you please pass the following to HRC. Thanks. Joe

Dear Madame Secretary,

When we last spoke at the Corporate Council on Africa you were kind enough to invite me to pay a call on you when in
DC. As it turns out, I will be in Washington for most of next week, arriving the afternoon of the 16th and returning to
Santa Fe the evening of the 20th ( the return is flexible if you were available to see me over the weekend.) I realize that
you are traveling this week and possibly into next, but I wanted to reach out to you. As I wrote to you earlier, I am a
director for Symbion Power and may soon assume more direct responsibility for all of Africa as Symbion expands there
from its current operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Symbion's competitive advantage is its reliance on local partnering
and human capacity development in the execution of its projects. Its success in the most difficult and dangerous
environments has been very impressive, as the four minute video that Sid gave to you on my behalf demonstrates. We
now want to bring that business model and philosophy to Africa where the social entrepreneurship and the
development of skilled labor is imperative for Africa's long term economic prospects, as you have so forcefully
articulated in past comments.
                                                                                          I am very enthusiastic about
Symbion. It is one or the very few American companies outside the petroleum sector willing to establish itself and to

undertake projects in Africa. With our record of success elsewhere, we are certain that our approach to project
development and execution will mesh nicely with African needs and U.S. policy priorities.

Valerie, Trevor and Samantha join me in extending our best wishes to you, Bill, and Chelsea as we enter the holiday
season.
