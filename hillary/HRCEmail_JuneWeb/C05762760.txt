Attached is the latest version of the speech, incorporating comments from Sandy and Strobe, as well as edits from
Cheryl and Anne-Marie and Lissa.

While it has improved, it has also grown in length. It is now just a bit shorter than your Senate confirmation
testimony. There are places to cut, but I want you to see it in full so you can make your own assessments.

John Podesta will send a few additional thoughts later today or tomorrow â€” the rest of his comments are captured in
this revised text.

Dennis is going to sharpen and hone the sections on the Middle East and Iran, and I will ask Holbrooke to work on the
Af-Pak piece.

I am available any time to discuss.
