Subject:                              Re: Travel



I'd like to stick w the 8 if we think it will go; if not, should we try the train at 6 or 7 if they're going; if not, I'd like to try
the 7am Monday shuttle as a last resort. How will we decide?

Lona and I wanted to check in with you on travel. All the news is reporting (Mario confirming) that travel tomorrow will
be messy. All flights to dc till 6pm tomorrow are basically canceled (though the 8pm is still scheduled to go). Mario has
asked us to check in tomorrow but as of now, he thinks a monday morning flight might be more reliable. There are trains
running but they expect delays, maybe cancellations. Below is lonas draft for monday. Do you want to hold off on
making a decision till we know more tomorrow?
