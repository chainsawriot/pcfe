Jim K. sent in some edits in the middle of the night -- strictly designed to trim/improve flow. Think it's worth you flipping
through to see if any strike you as worth making.

OK.  Went through it. It's not too much shorter, but I think it's tighter here and there. Made slight change at
end to try to tie in with how it started to bring full circle.

An area where you could save time and space (but I didn't try to change it) would be to shorten the parts where
you talk about Israel and Palestine and about Iraq and Afghanistan - it seems to me that those are tactical
discussions of an existing issue, and somewhat removed from the more abstract and strategic policy outline
she's otherwise aiming at here.

By the way, the phrase "global network of diverse partnerships" seems to be absent now. I kind of liked it on
several levels, but I presume it met some objection along the way...

Hi Jim,



We need you to give this one more pass-through â€” if you can find places to cut and clarify, that would be
great. Can you send something tonight your time?
