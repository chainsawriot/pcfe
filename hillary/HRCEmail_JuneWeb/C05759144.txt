I think Lona already confirmed swearing in for Monday. I'd also be happy to see him then too. Huma will check.

Cheryl —




Well, I finally made it. Quite a start to be able to ride in with the President in AF1 and then roll into meetings with
Calderon and the leadership of the Mexican government. I will spend this week in Mexico. I will be back next week to
pack out, but will also follow up on a number of other issues while I am there.




I wanted to ask if you thought it might be possible to get a bit of time with the Secretary. There are two requests going
through the system. One is for a formal swearing in. I understand that she has one swearing in at 4:00 on Monday in
the Ben Franklin room, so one option would be if she could do the same for me in the Treaty Room at 4:30. I know this
is short notice — this has been one of those cases where planning has alluded us.




The second request is for a meeting with the Secretary. I would very much appreciate the chance to go over priorities
moving forward, as well as provide a few initial observations.

Sorry to have to bother you with this. If it were not for the short timeframe and
                 I would not want to trouble you with this kind of thing.




Many thanks,




Carlos
