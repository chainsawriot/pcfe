  INFORMATION MEMORANDUM

  TO:             Ambassador Karl W. Eikenberry

  THROUGH: Deputy Ambassador Francis J. Ricciardone

  FROM:           Narcotics Affairs Section — Acting Director Lee R. Brown

  SUBJECT: Washington Post Inquiry / Investigation of DynCorp


  Summary. Washington Post reporter Ellen Nakashema contacted INL/NAS Police Program
  Manager Marissa Martin on June 3 to inquire about the State Department's Office of the
  Inspector General (OIG) investigation of DynCorp International in Afghanistan. Ms.
  Nakashema wrote the April 2009 Washington Post article on the drug overdose death of an
  American DynCorp. Ms. Nakashema said she has collected more negative reports on DynCorp
  and she expressed particular interested in an episode involving DynCorp contractors and a
  "dancing boy" in Konduz. She plans to publish an article within the next week or ten days.

   Background
                                                                                                   B7(A)




        •   On April 18, the Washington Post's Ellen Nakashema published a factually accurate
            article (Tab 1) about the DynCorp employee's death. The article did not address the
            "dancing boy" episode or other possible misconduct by DynCorp employees. The article

         cited a public statement (Tab 2) provided by A/S Johnson acknowledging problems in
         DynCorp management and employee conduct, noting that the three DynCorp Afghan
         Police Program managers had been dismissed, and pointing out that investigations were
         underway.




  Current Status

  Since the publication of the April 18 article, Ms. Nakashema says that she has received many
  calls and emails alleging DynCorp misconduct, including the "dancing boy" incident. In her call
  to Marissa Martin on June 3, Ms. Nakashema asked for confirmation of the incident, the status of
  the Department's OIG investigation, and if "it was true the Department called in the OIG
  because of the 'Dancing Boy' incident, instead of the death of Mr. Schafer." Marissa assured her
  that, as A/S Johnson stated for the record in April, investigations are underway regarding all of
  our concerns with DynCorp. Ms. Nakashema has also been in touch with INL Washington,
  which tells us that it expects another article to appear soon.
