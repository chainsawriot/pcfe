National Security Threats Posed by Climate Change and Our Dependence on Foreign Oil

Dear,

I've spent my entire life working to keep America safe. That is why I feel compelled to add my voice to the growing
number of senior U.S. generals, admirals, and veterans calling for immediate actions to address the alarming national
security threats posed by climate change and our dependence on foreign oil.

We import over half our oil from countries that are hostile to us. Last year, we paid over $255 BILLION to Middle
Eastern countries that are the primary funders for terrorists groups like Al Qaeda and to Russia and Venezuela.

The U.S. consumes more energy than any other country in the world, so increased U.S. fuel efficiency standards and
reliance on renewable energy will directly affect not only our own economic prosperity, but world energy prices as well.
That matters because when the cost of a barrel of crude oil increases $10, the Ayatollah Khamenei in Iran gets $15
billion more, Putin in Russia gets an extra $36 billion, and Hugo Chavez in Venezuela gets an additional $10 billion to
prop up his anti-American regime.

Furthermore, since the military is the largest energy consumer in the U.S., that same $10/barrel increase means DoD has
to spend $1.3 billion more on fuel, which is equal to the entire procurement budget for the Marine Corps.

But our reliance on foreign oil does more than fund our enemies. The droughts, famines, and rising sea levels caused by
climate change pose perhaps the greatest destabilizing influence the world will face over the next 50 years.

Forty percent of the world's population gets its drinking water from mountain glaciers that could disappear within
decades. Without forceful and decisive action, conflict will likely erupt among climate refugees competing for dwindling
resources and political destabilization will create ungoverned spaces where terrorists can flourish. These effects were
seen in Afghanistan in the 1990s and are currently being experienced in Somalia and Darfur, were genocide erupted
following the drying of Lake Chad, leaving 300,000 dead.

We must act now. A huge coalition of faith and military leaders have joined together to support efforts in Congress to
pass effective climate change legislation this year. We need you to add your voice to ours by taking 1 minute to
encourage your Member of Congress to support this effort. Please click here to email or call your Representative.
