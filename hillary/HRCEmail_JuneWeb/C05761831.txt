I heard from jon.
Wjc reviewed your edits
Said they were all good
Has some of his own (from original copy) that he said he "doesn't feel very strongly about" but they make it less wordy
and easier to give. I can send that version to you if u want.
He mentioned you may want the section on "purpose of power" at the end.
