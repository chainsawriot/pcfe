The Post's Dec 27 editorial ("Redefining Human Rights") on the Obama
Administration's human rights and democracy policies, and Secretary
Clinton's recent speech at Georgetown in particular, misses THE CRITICAL
POINT: human rights, democracy, and development are mutually reinforcing,
not competing goals. They complement each other in the [DELETE: practical]
task of making human rights a human reality.

President Roosevelt understood the fundamental link between liberty,
prosperity and security, tying together freedom of speech and worship with
freedom from want and freedom from fear in his famous "Four Freedoms"
speech. At Georgetown, Secretary Clinton articulated a 21st century vision
grounded in this [DELETE: old] wisdom.

To accuse Secretary Clinton of embracing a Soviet-bloc approach to human
rights because she includes development in a discussion of democracy not
only strains the bonds of credulity and common sense, it also walls off a
crucial avenue for ensuring that people can actually exercise the rights
that are naturally theirs - including the rights to freedom of religion,
association, and speech-in their daily lives.

AS SECRETARY CLINTON MADE CLEAR, policies that address development alone are
not adequate: "Freedom doesn't come in half measures, and partial remedies

will not solve the whole problem," she said. But experience shows us that
where broad-based development occurs, people are more likely to demand a say
in securing their futures, and governments are more likely to have the
resources to maintain the strong institutions, including reliable police and
fair courts, that help ensure the consistent protection of rights. Where
people are given the right to speak freely, to participate in their nation's
political process and have access to basic information about government,
sustainable development is [DELETE: much] more likely to occur. At the same
time, democracies without development do not last. These are mutually
reinforcing tracks, and the Obama Administration is committed to pursuing
both simultaneously.

As President Obama said in his Nobel lecure, "engagement with repressive
regimes lacks the satisfying purity of indignation." But the Post's
overheated outrage ignores the [DELETE: practical] lessons learned by
generations of men and women who worked to advance human rights around the
world.

[DELETE: And t]To suggest that Secretary Clinton somehow provided excuses to
rights-abusing dictators in a speech in which she forcefully critized
specific abuses across the world, is simply not credible. Far from being an
excuse for any regime, this is an approach that pushes governments to do
more to advance civil and political rights and to ensure that democracy
actually delivers a measure of prosperity and opportunity for all. It's the
right approach for 21st century.
