Congress earmarked 2.5 mil dollars for democracy stuff in Libya. Not an Admin request. Requirement to work through
NG0s. Requests for proposals went out, came in, were evaluated. One was going to an NGO with links to.an NGO in
Libya run by a Qadhafi. Congressional staff briefed on Monday. Thus the questions now.
