(SBU) Media report the Burmese court found Aung San Suu Kyi and two of her assistants guilty of violating security law.
The ruling junta commuted each sentence to 18 months and ordered ASSK returned to house arrest. Embassy Rangoon
reports American Citizen John Yettaw received a sentence of seven years hard labor, which was not commuted.
