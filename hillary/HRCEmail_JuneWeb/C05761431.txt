I agree with Dan about the ornament problem. The draft needs refinement not re-working. And a call is a great idea. I
am just getting off a plane but could be available any time after 4 pm or so if that works for you.

The latest draft is getting closer. And I agree w Dan that we have to be careful not to topple the tree w too many
ornaments. That said, I'd like to have a call w you (and anyone else who you think should be on) this afternoon or
evening to raise a few points. I'm copying Lona and Huma so they can help schedule it. Thanks for all your good work.
