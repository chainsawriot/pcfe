David--

  Thank you for your too kind words which were a greatly welcome addition to my healing and rehab. My word of advice
is to watch where you step and stay grounded!

  It's an honor to serve the President w you and I'd enjoy spending some one-on-one time just comparing notes and
catching up in the next weeks. All the best, Hillary

Hillary:
I have hesitated to email because I'm sure you are being inundated with good wishes. But I just wanted to tell you how
sorry I was to hear about your injury. It sounded horribly painful.
I hope you will allow yourself to rest and recover. You are an all-star player, and we need you for the long run!
David
