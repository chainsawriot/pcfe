Italian foreign minister cancels trip to Iran

ROME (AP) — Italy's foreign minister has canceled a planned trip to Iran for talks on regional security issues.

The Foreign Ministry in a statement Wednesday cited a problem over the meeting place with President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. It said it regretted the "lost opportunity" to discuss involving Iran in the stabilization
of Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Foreign Minister Franco Frattini had been scheduled to depart later Wednesday.

The communiqué made no mention of reported criticism over the planned trip, nor did it mention a missile test
conducted Wednesday by Iran with a range capable of reaching Israel and U.S. Mideast bases.
