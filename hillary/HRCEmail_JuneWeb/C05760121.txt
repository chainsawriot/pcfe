Jim and Phil--

  I returned his call and discussed the Macedonia name issue, Cyprus, and relations w Turkey. There's a memcon that
reflects his stated commitment to solve or improve status of these issues.

  I've known him a long time and will be happy to follow up w him on any and all of these matters w your guidance. He
seems determined to put points on the board to have a fast start so we should intensify our efforts w him. Let me know
what else you want me to do. Thx.
