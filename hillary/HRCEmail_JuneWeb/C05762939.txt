Major impact in Manila and throughout the Philippines from the Secretary's recorded National Day greeting.

Below is from the legendary Kristie Kenney, our Ambo.

Folks: the secretary's video was a huge success. Thanks so much to our EAP team for getting it done and to the Manila
PAS team for getting it out on a holiday. It was a terrific message.

Am just leaving the Palace independence day fete (looking stiff in my filipiana) where the President grabbed me to say
"please thank Secretary Clinton for that wonderful message. No one has ever done that before and it really showed that
the United States cares about us". Secretary Romulo stopped me and said "I heard secretary Clinton's message over the
radio this morning and it was beautiful.".

Everyone from the gate guards to shopping mall vendors stopping me to say they saw/heard Secretary's message.
People are literally thrilled and stunned that our Secretary of State would reach out in such a personal fashion.

Bravo to all of you who made that happen.
