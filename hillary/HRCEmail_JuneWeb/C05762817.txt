Yes. We had Jim raise this with the Greek ambassador yesterday, who told him that they were aware of the situation
and would come back with a report when Jim got to Corfu.

Dear Hillary,
John Solomon, Exec Editor of Washington Times and a close personal friend (and always fair to us as AP reporter and
later Wash Post reporter), has called about a Wash Times reporter who is being held by Iranians. He says Greeks have
good relations and he believes they are trying to help. He believes you are meeting with Greek Foreign Minister
tomorrow and hopes you can raise the issue with him - he may already know something about it. Any information he
knows would help family.
Hope you can do this -
And hope your elbow is better -
Best wishes,
Lanny
