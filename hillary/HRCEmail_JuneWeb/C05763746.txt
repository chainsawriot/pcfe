Great you can begin PT- one of the best things in life for broken parts and aching bodies! Agree merger is a positive with good
possibilities. Nice to see you named best cabinet member in Washingtonian since job is so tough and world generally conspires to
make it tougher. Finally getting your whole team on board should help. Will save any issue discussion or thoughts for other than
email. Keep taking care and, hopefully, the only fireworks this weekend will be in American communities.

Wendy--

  Thanks for your good wishes. 1 am finally on the mend and starting physical therapy. One word of advice--watch where you step!

  I was very excited by the announced merger w Sandy's firm which sounds like a win-win for all.

  I miss seeing you and hope we can remedy that soon. Happy 4th!
