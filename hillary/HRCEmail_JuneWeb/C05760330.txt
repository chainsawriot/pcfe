Huma/Jake:

Just got further updates from a de facto rep and Amb Llorens. The de facto authorities have decided to turn this
exercise into a sort of loya girga to get buy-in for M's departure. This evening the discussions included religious groups
and business leaders. Tomorrow government officials and others. My de facto contact says results tonight were good
although it was not easy for many to accept the logic behind M's exit. He said the US once again has been the catalyst
for movement in Honduras. Thinking is now for a Monday announcement.

We'll stay on it and update you.
