Subject: Nominees Confirmed

Just a couple of minutes ago, the Senate confirmed the following nominees:

Cal. #37 — Timothy Geithner to be Governor of the IMF, etc.

Cal. #38 — Richard Verma to be Assistant Secretary of State — Leg Affairs

Cal. #39 — Esther Brimmer to be Assistant Secretary of State — Intl Organization Affairs

Cal. #41 — Rose Gottemoeller to be Assistant Secretary of State — Verification

Cal. #42 — Karl Eikenberry to be Ambassador to Afghanistan

Cal. #44 — Melanne Verveer to be Ambassador at Large for Women's Global Affairs

Neither Chris Hill nor Phil Gordon. were confirmed this time around. Leader Reid explained that a vote on Hill's
nomination will occur when the Senate reconvenes on Monday, April 20th. We need to find out more on the status of
Gordon's nomination.

Thanks.
