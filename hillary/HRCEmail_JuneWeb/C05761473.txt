Hi Cheryl,
I do not believe there is Twittering in the Secretary's name. The Twittering is from DipNote, the State Department's Blog
htto://twitter.com/dipnote

It will occasionally quote the Secretary but the Twittering should not be done in her name.

But we should not be twittering in the Secretary's name since she is not the person actually twittering.

There is a reference in Newsweek to her twittering and says: Hillary Clinton Style: Dry info and offers 4,788 followers

Can you advise who is twittering in her name and how we can address?

Thanks.
