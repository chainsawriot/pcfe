Gordon Brown called me today to convey his very best to you, etc, etc, taking the phone from Shaun,
in the office they now work in together, right after Shaun briefed me that he and Gordon will be
meeting with Martin McGuiness together on Wednesday and may want your help with Adams. I said
that he and Gordon should let me know before Wednesday whether your involvement is essential and
what they request. That is fine with them and Shaun will get back to me. Sid
