Tuesday, Sept 1 and return Thurs, Sept 10.




Rough version of places and people is:

Lew, Verma, Campbell, Paul Jones and Sean Misko (SRAP), possibly David Robinson (PRM)




Sept 6-7         Pakistan

Lew, Verma, Campbell, Paul Jones and Sean Misko (SRAP), possibly David Robinson (PRM)




Sept 8-9         Afghanistan

Lew, Verma, Campbell, Paul Jones and Sean Misko (SRAP), possibly David Robinson (PRM)

Hooking up with Acting AID Administration Alonzo Fulgham for a portion of the trip




Sept 10          Brussels (am)

                  Washington (pm)




As discussed very briefly with PJ and Ian this am., Jack floated the idea of having a journalist accompany us.
Alternatively, we are very focused on both international and local journalists, esp in India and Af/Pak.




Not planning to do media in Iraq or Brussels.




Very open to doing something in advance of trip (though hard to squeeze in Mon/Tues) and upon return.




Piper
