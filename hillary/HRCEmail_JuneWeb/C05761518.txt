Subject: second conversation with Mr. Gore re detained Amcits in North Korea

I spoke with Mr. Gore a second time today; I called him this afternoon after we had seen some brief wire stories appear,
referencing the KCNA report below. Explaining that this was my personal view, I said I was encouraged that the term
"espionage" did not appear in the KCNA report. I also mentioned that we were not aware of recent cases where
previously detained Amcits in the DPRK were "indicted" and "brought to trial." I said I wouldn't read too much into
terms such as "illegal entry" and "suspected hostile acts"; I was still convinced that the track we've been pursuing, i.e.
gaining consular access through the Swedish Amb. in Pyongyang, and contact via other diplomatic channels, offered
hope for a resolution.

Mr. Gore said he very much appreciated the call. He asked that we convey as much of this information as we could to
the family members. I told him we would do so through CA.

 The organ is carrying on its investigation and, at the same time, making a preparation for
indicting them at a trial on the basis of the already confirmed suspicions.
 While the investigation is under way consular contact is allowed and the
