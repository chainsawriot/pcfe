Subject: Interim Clearance Denied -




Pursuant to your request, and in accordance with Executive Order 12968, Section 3.3, your request to grant an interim
clearance to                      is denied. Due to the fact this is not a final security clearance determination, a decision
not to grant an interim clearance is not subject to appeal under the provisions of the E.O. No negative inference shall be
made regarding the denial of an individual's interim clearance, which solely means that there is investigative work that
must take place in the US or abroad that will take additional time to complete to comply with national standards prior to
a final clearance determination being made.
