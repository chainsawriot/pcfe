No, it's only an internal assessment from someone in the Iran Watch Office. Kay added me to their updates so I'm
seeing their internal chit chat.

I have to admit I don't understand statistics enough to gauge it's accuracy, but they are trying to prove the accusation of
egregious fraud. The only other #s are actual vote tallies coming from the Iranian Interior Ministry, showing Mousavi
winning by far - but the #s are unconfirmed.

Since it's after 4am in Tehran, most of the reporting now is focusing on tumult

Nothing is coming from State publicly aside from what you said this afternoon.

Is that going public? Is it posted on our website?

Most interesting observation of the day, from State:

"A statistical analysis of the data issued by the ministry of interior suggests a perfect linear relationship between votes
received by Ahmadinejad and Mousavi with an r-squared value of 0.9995, a near impossibility in nature.This suggests
that the ballots were never counted or were abandoned after it was clear Ahmadinejad was going to lose. Statistically, it
is impossible to maintain such a perfect linear relationship consistently through all stages of vote counting. We would
expect variation as the votes were coming in, due to differences expected between the cites and the country side and
hetereogeneity amoung ethnic groups.This to me is the most concrete evidence I have seen"
