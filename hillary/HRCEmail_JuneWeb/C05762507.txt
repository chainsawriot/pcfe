Wilma,

Attached is background information on the legislation Senator Voinovich referenced in his call with Secretary Clinton
today.

As Senator Voinovich mentioned to the Secretary, both bills are personal priorities for him.

I am the point of contact for the Passport Card Travel Enhancement Act of 2009 (S. 321), and we would like to work with
you in an effort to address State's concerns with the legislation. Please let me know if you have questions or need
additional information regarding this bill.

Todd Johnston is the point of contact for the International Clean Energy Development Act of 2009 (S.840). He can be
reached at 202-224-3353.      â€¢


Thanks,
Tara
