Yes--but it may be too late tonight so also ask about tomorrow. It's about the budget and the OMB are anxious to close
so I need to reach him in the next 12 hours since Jack just got the final word.

I haven't yet.
Wouldn't have done that without your clearance but I can do so right now if you are ok?

Jack said you had told him I could call the POTUS tonight about the budget. Did you reach out to the White House about
the call?
