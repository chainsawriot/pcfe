Cheryl,

I know the book Dead Aid well. The ideas are not new. They are essentially the same ones that Bill Easterly
has proposed in his two books: The Elusive Quest for Growth and White Man's Burden. The essential
argument is that a top-down, "big-plan" approach to foreign assistance â€” the Jeff Sachs' approach - has not
worked in the past and will not work in the future.

Both Easterly and Moyo argue for a bottom-up approach that supports overall economic growth. They
emphasize expanding access to capital markets and low-cost financing, promoting better governance and
accountability, policy reform to enhance foreign investment, and support for market-driven social
entrepreneurs.

I will give Nora a couple of articles for you to take home and look at. One of them, by Paul Collier, offers a
strong alternative to the USAID approach of funding small holder farmers. The other is by Dambisa Moyo and
will give you an overall flavor of her perspective.

Matt
