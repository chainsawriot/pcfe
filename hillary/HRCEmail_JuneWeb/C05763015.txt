ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Taliban insurgents had planned to use five Americans, now detained in Pakistan, who had
contacted the militants via the Internet, to carry out attacks in the U.S.-allied country, a police official said. Usman
Anwar; police chief in Sargodha, where the men were arrested this month, said emails had revealed plans for the young
men from Virginia to travel to a Pakistani nuclear power plant. "We believe that they were supposed to be used inside
Pakistan," Anwar told Reuters by telephone. "In their last email to the Taliban, we found they mentioned the Chashma
Nuclear Plant and that's why they were going to Mianwali (district)."
