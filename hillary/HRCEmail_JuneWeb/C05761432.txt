    FOREIGN ASSISTANCE REFORM: DEFINING A WAY FORWARD
Foreign assistance reform is one of the most widely discussed and debated topics
on the foreign policy agenda. Indeed, the volume of literature on this topic led the
Center for Global Engagement to produce a "Report on Reports," to summarize the
major points of consensus and disagreement among reports and outline another
series of recommendations. To make the key decisions to shape our foreign
assistance reform effort we need to answer three basic questions: (1) What are we
trying to achieve? (2) Where are we now? and (3) What do we need to change?
The U.S. Record on Foreign Assistance
The U.S. is the world's largest donor of bilateral foreign assistance. In calendar
year 2008 the United States disbursed $26 billion in Official Development
Assistance (ODA). Elements of this assistance include:
   • $6.5 billion to sub-Saharan Africa, an increase from $4.6 billion in 2007;

   • $6.9 billion in bilateral assistance to least developed countries;

   • $4.4 billion in U.S. humanitarian assistance.

In addition, over the past five years the U.S. committed:

   • $18.8 billion in funding through the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for
     AIDS Relief to treat HIV\AIDS, Malaria & TB;

   • $6.4 billion in Compact funding for 18 strongly performing countries by the
     Millennium Challenge Corporation.

The President's 2010 budget request provides $53.9 billion to State and other
international programs, of which $36.5 billion is for foreign assistance -- putting
the U.S. on the path to doubling foreign assistance by 2015. Meanwhile the 2009
supplemental funding meets diplomatic and assistance needs focused on terrorism,
humanitarian assistance, stabilization and peacekeeping operations including in
Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq.

I.      What are we trying to achieve?

The development of a comprehensive foreign assistance strategy requires both an
articulation of the problems we seek to address, as well as the principles,
objectives, and operational strategies that will guide our efforts. We have already
defined and articulated a number of ideas: Smart Power; the Three Ds — defense,
diplomacy and development; and the three P's of principles, partnership, and
pragmatism. Our challenge is to further define:

     > What are the goals of our foreign assistance programs?

     > What principles and objectives should guide the formulation of our strategy?

     > What emphasis should be placed on security and strategic objectives, vice
       humanitarian and poverty goals?

     > What problems are we trying to solve?

     > What gaps remain in our foreign assistance programs relative to the
       outcomes we seek?

     > How do we need to be organized to get the job done?

     > What budget, planning and coordination functions do we need in the long-
       term and in the short-term during the period of transition?

II. Where are we now?
In keeping with the Administration's commitment to renewing America's global
leadership through vigorous diplomacy and innovative development efforts, initial
efforts have focused on getting State and USAID the resources needed to rebuild
capacity and on the civilian aspects of our most immediate foreign policy priorities
(Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq) :
        The 2009 Omnibus and supplemental start the investment in capacity;
        The 2010 Budget increases investment in capacity and program;
       Afghanistan, food security, global health and other initiatives reflect new
       approach to coordination and identification of key objectives;

         The 2011 Budget process is being developed to drive collaboration across
         silos, integrating USAID, MCC, PEPFAR with regional and functional
         bureaus of State;
         In the short-term, Defense authorizations have been limited in time and
         scope and are now in process to be driven to strategic resolution;
         Proposed foreign aid authorization bills and NSC processes create pressure
         to accelerate work on a long-term strategic plan.
  III. What needs to be changed?
  Our foreign assistance programs are too fractured and discordant and the question
  is what policy and structural changes are needed to achieve a greater level of
  coordination and coherence. The following structures and mechanisms form the
  key elements of any reform agenda:
         (1) Structural & Management Change: DC
         > What should be the relationship between State and USAID? Between
           State and MCC? Between PEPFAR and these institutions? To the extent
           changes in structures and relationships require legislative reform, what is
           the likelihood this can be achieved?

         > What is the best budget management structure within the State
           Department? What is the current budgeting and planning process, and
           what role do F and M play in it?

         > What training and recruitment practices need to be developed to build the
           civilian capacity we need?

         (2) Structural & Management Change: Field

         > What role should the Ambassador and DCM play in coordinating our
           foreign assistance programs in the field? What mechanisms are needed
           to achieve greater coordination, including with programs managed from
           Washington?
         > How can we improve flexibility and responsiveness to circumstances on
           the ground?

        (3) Contract Reform
        We need to quickly constitute a task force to address issues related to the
        following categories of service providers: (1) DC-based contractors
        ("Beltway Bandits"); (2) implementing partners and NG0s; and (3) security
        and service contracts.
         > How do we ensure that even "good contractors" receive strategic
           guidance at the front end?

         > What are alternatives to the contracting model? Nation-to-nation
           cooperation, greater reliance on local organizations, public-private
           initiatives, economic drivers such as remittances.
        (4) Relationship between State and DoD
         > What is the appropriate balance between civilian and military
           involvement in foreign assistance activities?

         > How do we define "conflict" situations, and where do we draw the lines
           in this regard?

         > How do we make sure the authorities and the money move together?
        (5) Metrics & Accountability
         > How do we measure efficacy and achieve accountability for results?

         > How do we create sustainable and durable programs and avoid the
           narrow focus on achieving numerical targets?
  Coming out of this discussion, we need to define a process that will develop a
  comprehensive and detailed strategy that addresses each of these areas. Part of that
  process and strategy must also include a vision for working with the White House,
  the Hill and other agencies to accomplish our goals.
