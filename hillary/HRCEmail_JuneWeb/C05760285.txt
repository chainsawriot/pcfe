Cheryl,

As you know, l                            is serving as a public delegate to UNGA. I don't have details, but we have just
learned that               's son died this weekend. We do not know more than that and so far, there is nothing in the
press about it. I thought you and the Secretary would want know about this. Will update you if I learn more.

Brooke
