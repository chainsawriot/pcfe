- pls call jake when u can thru ops. He has a few things to report
- Holbrooke called me this morning with a point that hasn't been presented to u. He doesn't think u absolutely have to
do camps if u go to pak. He thinks a short visit with officials, just a few hours doing bilateral things is sufficient and
talking about idps while u r in country will more than make the point. Something else to consider as u make ur decision.
