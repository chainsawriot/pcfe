EUR tells me that they have engaged fully with Ambassador Bagley and Kris Balderston on this project, and that
Ambassador Bagley has spoken with the Italian Ambassador and reviewed the proposed approach. She said he thought
that it sounded like a good plan and would be warmly received. They are ready to convene a meeting with the NIAF
President as soon as the Secretary approves the action memo.
