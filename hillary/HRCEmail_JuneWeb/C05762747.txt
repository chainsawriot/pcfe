Subject:                             Palau offended by US positions



Below is the statement of very impressive Palau reps at the end of a session of required meetings on the next
phase of free association aid. FYI only, the Palauans were insulted by the nature and depth of the response to
their proposal as well as the content and the overall approach. They are even privately questioning the
relationship. (This hasn't affected their intent to take the Uighurs.) I will send a few further thoughts.

At the conclusion of yesterday's meeting, the Palau delegation caucused to discuss its reaction to the response of the United
States delegation to the proposals that it made in June in Washington D.C., and expanded upon in subsequent communications.

While the Palau delegation has agreed to respond to certain additional questions raised by the United States delegation on specific
elements of the Palau proposal, and further has agreed to participate in certain working groups on specific issues, the Palau
delegation was deeply disappointed with the response of the United States delegation. The United States delegation did not
seriously respond, as required by the Compact, to the operational requirements of the Government of Palau or to Palau's
comprehensive and considered plans to achieve economic advancement and self-sufficiency.

In light of the foregoing, the Palau delegation has determined that it must now return to Palau to discuss with President Toribiong
the next steps that Palau needs to take regarding the Compact. Thank you.

Jeff
