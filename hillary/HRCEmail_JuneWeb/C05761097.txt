Dear Dave,




Several people have revisited an idea I know you have heard before — that ISAF, the UN, and the U.S. Mission buy some
of their food on the local economy. This would:

     provide a source of rapid income to farmers;

     reduce somewhat the amount of resupply convoys;




I have asked MG Field to look into this. I know that there are health and security issues, but perhaps there are ways to
deal with them on a local basis. Richard Holbrooke
