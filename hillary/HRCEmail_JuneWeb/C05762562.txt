Thanks. Adding Cheryl. S will be doing regular SVICs with Hill and she'll be back in Iraq before long.

As I told Jake and PJ, I was bit surprised that CNN (Charley Keyes) asked me at the podium if the Dept. was
concerned that the VP was seeming to be on the ascendent in foreign policy.

I talked to him off the record, and he admitted that he gets a "steady drumbeat" of requests from producers to find out "if
Hillary is holding her own" in the intragency battles, and particularly if there's infighting between her and White House.

He said what specifically prompted his q at the briefing on whether the VP was beginning to usurp S's role in foreign policy
was Gibb's announcement Tuesday that the VP was taking lead in Iraq policy (below).

I emphasized to him that the Sec is very engaged and involved in Iraq policy, noting she was on a conference call today
with Chris Hill.

Think much of this is the perennial Washington story of who's up and who's down, but it still bears careful watch. Ian

   QUESTION: And yesterday, you said that you'd try to get back to
us on vice president's role in Iraq policy.

    GIBBS: Sure.

    QUESTION: Can you fill us in on that?

Odierno and Ambassador Hill in -- in working with the Iraqis toward
overcoming their political differences and achieving the type of
reconciliation that we all understand has yet to fully take place, but
needs to take place.
   QUESTION: Well, what does -- what does that mean, "oversee"? In
what way will that change or enlarge his interaction with the
president, with General Odierno or Ambassador Hill?

  GIBBS: Well, I -- I mean, obviously, he spends a fairly decent
amount of time with the president.

   QUESTION: Right.

    GIBBS: I think the meetings that I've been in, in different
parts of the building on Iraq, the vice president has always been an
active participant. I think, given his knowledge of the region, the
number of times he's been there, he's perfectly suited for this type
of role.

  QUESTION: I guess what I'm getting at, does it mean travel?
Does it mean briefing? Does it mean doing some of the things he's
done more publicly, for example, on the stimulus?


   GIBBS: My sense is, it probably means many of those things.
Again, I think what we want to ensure happens is that, as we reach
these milestones and these important dates, that we not forget that
work has to be done to get our troops back and to achieve that
political reconciliation. This is somebody who can oversee that at
the White House and ensure that we're making continued progress toward
those goals.
