Romulo said they welcome additional help so I told them to pls follow up w our Ambassador. I think you should follow
up as well.

On a very bad line, Wirajuda seemed to welcome our support, including helicopters and other navel assets. Pls followup
and have Navy do as well.

Let me know what else we need to do.
