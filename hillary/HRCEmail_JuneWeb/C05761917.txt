Cheryl:
Thanks for all your help and guidance on getting HRC to our Commencement.
Clearly she was a hit!
Her presence and her message added luster to the event.

Greg reported record attendance for an NYU Commencement and largest seated graduation in NYC history: over 27,000.

Sorry I missed seeing you but I understand many did...

I hope the Secretary was pleased.

All the best,
Lynne
