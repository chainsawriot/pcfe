One more item -- I am sure you noticed on the line block the possible meeting with Peres around 9:00am. If we were to
do this meeting, we would have to go to his hotel in Woodley Park -- we asked if he would come to State and they
pushed back. Do you feel strongly about doing this meeting or should I go ahead and let them know we need to take a
pass this time?

A few items:

Are you able to move everything from today to later in the week? What about the personnel meetings?

Am I seeing the Angolan FM when he visits May 19-22?

Was I invited by Powell and Albright to attend the Initiative for Global Development event this Wed-Thurs at the Willard
Hotel?
