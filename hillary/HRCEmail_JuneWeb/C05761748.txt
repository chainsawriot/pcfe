The Secretary's Phone Calls with Japanese, ROK, Chinese and Russian Foreign Ministers

Monday, May 25, 2009

      UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761748 Date: 06/30/2015




Purpose: To reach out to Japan, South Korea, China and Russia following the probable May 24 DPRK nuclear test.




•    A nuclear test by North Korea, if confirmed, would be a provocative act and an unequivocal violation of UNSCR
1718, blatantly disregarding the will of the international community.




•     We have remained united in the face of the DPRK's provocations, and we need to maintain this unity among the
Six-Party partners. The DPRK's message to us in advance of the test, which blamed the UNSC's "failure to apologize for
its Presidential Statement," demonstrates the degree to which the DPRK has isolated itself. Now is the right time for a
Five-Party meeting to demonstrate our unity.




•    It is essential that the UN Security Council take strong measures to clearly demonstrate that the DPRK's actions will
have consequences. The United States believes that it is essential that the Security Council issue a swift statement
condemning the DPRK's test at its initial May 25 emergency meeting. The UNSC should then quickly follow up with a
strong new Chapter 7 Resolution that includes concrete response measures.




•    [FOR TOKYO AND SEOUL] The United States remains committed to the nuclear umbrella and its obligations under
the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security and the U.S.-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty.

                                                                                                                             1.4(D)
