Dear Cheryl and Susan,

I am pleased to inform you that following two long conference calls with the Holocaust Survivors' Foundation and Sam
Dubbin, their lawyer, and with the timely intervention of Congressman Robert Wexler, the Foundation has sent the letter
below by FAX to Secretary Clinton, withdrawing their objection and supporting my efforts.

It was clear from the call that they are e

American Jewish Committee and ADL to the Jewish Claims Conference. But they are a voice we should hear,
                                                                                  They are sincere people, who are

I believe the conversations were very important and productive, and more importantly, so do the survivors with whom you
spoke.
We look forward to working together this week and thereafter.

Dear Secretary Clinton:

         With reference to our letter dated June 19, 2009, on behalf of the Holocaust Survivors Foundation USA, Inc.
(HSF), I would like to state that based on conversations that took place in the intervening time period between
Ambassador Eizenstat and the leadership of the HSF, and the commitments he made to our leaders, we are no longer
asking that he be replaced as the head of the U.S. delegation to the Prague Conference taking place on June 26-30.

         On behalf of all of the survivors for whom we have been fighting over the last decade, including tens of thousands
in desperate need, we wish Ambassador Eizenstat the best of success as the head of the United States delegation at the
Conference, as well as in the follow-up activities that we understand will occur on matters affecting Holocaust survivors'
rights and interests.

               Sincerely,


               David Schaecter
