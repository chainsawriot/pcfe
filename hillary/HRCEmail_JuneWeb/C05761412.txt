Hillary: In Rome, on way to Florence to NYU Center on Law and Security Conference. Here's the
point: While here, I had dinner tonight with                      (meeting with Pope on N. Ireland). He
told me he's meeting with                    on Friday. He told me things you would in my judgment want
and need to hear because they will likely involve your personal role. I think you should step in and ask
him to tell you directly. I also should relate to you when I return information about Brown government
re foreign ministry. Meetings here with former PM Amato, former amb. Saleo, key journalists for
Correire, Repubblica, Europa, RAI, etc, new re Berlusconi, as usual the real story is not what's public.
