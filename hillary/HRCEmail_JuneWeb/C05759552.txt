Cheryl:

We have just learned that Tim Rieser may call you soon to request that the Secretary call Senator Reid to urge him take
up the FY10 State/Foreign Ops Appropriations Bill at the earliest opportunity in September— to avoid the negative
impact of a continuing resolution on State operations and programs.

As you know, if Senator Reid was able/willing to schedule time on the Senate floor there still remains a significant
obstacle. While the FY10 Bill had broad bipartisan support prior to markup, it now includes a controversial Lautenberg
amendment that would reverse the Mexico City policy statutorily. With Lautenberg's amendment in the Bill, procedural
hurdles are almost certain to lengthen and slow down floor action.

It is possible that an agreement could be reached to bring up the Bill and structure votes so that the Republicans could
offer amendments including one to strike Lautenberg's language.

Should you agree to ask the Secretary to make such a call I would imagine she would want to get views from Jack Lew,
Pat Kennedy, Rich Greene, and Rich Verma, first.

Here are some points to consider for such a possible call:

      Timely enactment of the FY 10 State/Foreign Ops appropriation is critical to national security.

•   Operating under a Continuing Resolution for any extended period of time will negatively impact both State
operations and foreign assistance programs.

•   For example, the funds available to support State operations in Iraq are estimated to last only through the first
quarter of FY 2010. In addition our urgent hiring plans will be stifled, pay equity authorities will lapse, and we will be
without the necessary resources to implement our agenda on food security, climate change, and global health.

    I urge you to take up the FY 10 State/Foreign Ops bill as early as possible in September.

Background

Mexico City Policy: The inclusion during markup of the Lautenberg amendment in the Senate bill codifies a ban on future
adoption of the Mexico City Policy. This controversial issue will slow down consideration of the Bill, as the Minority will
use parliamentary maneuvers to block timely debate and final passage.
