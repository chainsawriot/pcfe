LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Congressman Henry Waxman, the powerful chairman the U.S. House of Representatives Energy
and Commerce Committee, has been hospitalized in Los Angeles for an undisclosed ailment, a spokeswoman said. The
69-year-old veteran Democrat from Southern California was not feeling well on Tuesday and was admitted to Cedars-
Sinai Medical Center for "routine testing," the spokeswoman, Karen Lightfoot said. "He's feeling much better now,"
Lightfoot said. She declined to disclose the nature of his ailment or how long he is expected to remain in the hospital.
Waxman, a member of Congress since 1975, was a leading co-sponsor of landmark climate change legislation passed by
the House on Friday.
