Thanks, Hillary. I'm attaching the CV of                     and have also sent it to Jake. I'd have loved to attend the       B6
India lunch, but I've got a long-standing working lunch with the "Managing Global Insecurity" project at Brookings that
Carlos Pascual set up and has been leading. Tom Pickering, Tim Wirth, Chet Crocker, Esther Brimmer, and various other
such will be there, and I can't pull out (my office had passed this word to yours). I'm so pleased you're going to India. It
was your trip to the region, with Chelsea, in 95 that established the momentum for Bill's. I'll always remember you talk
(with slide show) at State after you returned. I'll send you tomorrow my book "Engaging India" now thatyou're re-
engaging them. Hard work ahead of on non-pro, as you know. Hope to see you before long. I'm taking                 to Italy    B6
and Turkey for two weeks next Saturday. Warmest regards, Strobe

 As you may know, I'm trying to work out a time for lunch or dinner in the next week to discuss a list of issues w you.
Hope we can work it out.

Any ideas?

 Hope to see you soon. All the best, Hillary
