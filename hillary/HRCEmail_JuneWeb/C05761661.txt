Subject:

Cheryl and Huma,
          As HRC requested for this weekend, attached is a draft base text for the big speech/FA article. I will be on a
plane all day Wednesday heading for Asia to do policy planning talks, so it would be great to have her feedback either by
phone on Monday or meeting with her on Tuesday â€” that way I could turn around another draft by Thursday to
response to her reactons and then Lissa and I could work on turning it into a real speech draft and circulate more
widely. I will also have plenty of time on my trip to work over a version that would be more suitable for Foreign Affairs,
assuming she is comfortable with the overall frame and the different pieces.
          Have a good weekend!
         AM
