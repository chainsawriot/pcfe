Here's some general background info on FFF from NEA.
The gender initiative has potential but right now it's just a framework. It's going to take leadership. There are so many
good practices in the region that could be shared -- Morocco's family law reform being an excellent example.

Hi Melanne,

I don't have electronic access to all documents, but attached are a few documents that might be helpful. Please let me
know if you need more than the attached. Alice may be able to provide more when she gets back to the control room.
