Strobe--

 I've seen         wice running and walking in front of my house, once w          and sent greetings to you.

 As you may know, I'm trying to work out a time for lunch or dinner in the next week to discuss a list of issues w you.
Hope we can work it out.

 Also, I am looking for another smart, politically sawy assistant, preferably one w foreign policy experience expertise.
Any ideas?

 Hope to see you soon. All the best, Hillary
