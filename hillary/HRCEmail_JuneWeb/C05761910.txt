the beginning of a nice review from chicago tribune below... .(and it looks like she added some excellent
personal touches to the final remarks, if I'm not mistaken)....

"Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton held the infield today at the new Yankee Stadium. "Does it get

And the former senator from New York may have hit one out of the park, as the commencement speaker at
New York University's graduation, suggesting that everyone who had used their social networks to help elect
Barack Obama president should turn that e-power toward doing good for other people."
