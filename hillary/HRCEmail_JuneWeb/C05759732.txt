Subject: Negotiations with Iran

After much back and forth, the speech does not affirmatively indicate our willingness/openness to explore talking about
other issues with Iran. Bill's recommendation is that if you are asked about it, you should say we are open to exploring
other subjects in addition to the nuclear file, but that you should not state that affirmatively.
