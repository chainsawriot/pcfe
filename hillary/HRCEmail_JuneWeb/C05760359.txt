I was just talking to Mark Landler and relayed at the behest of the IG that they wanted to be sure Mark understood that
the current IG inspection of Kabul is routine and that it always includes a leadership/management survey of the boss.
Mark laughed and said he understood that, because of his knowledge of the inspection that is wrapping up in my
bureau. It is why he put mention of the inspection at the tail end of the story.
