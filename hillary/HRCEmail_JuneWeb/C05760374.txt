Dear Cheryl and Jake,

I wanted to let you know that after a great deal of soul-searching, I have decided to leave the State Department in about
a month.

This was an exceptionally difficult decision; one of the most difficult I have made in my life. It has been a honor and a
real joy to have been part of the team here at State; the past year has been one of the most enriching experiences of my
career. I am leaving only for personal reasons; after pushing myself as hard as I possibly could the last several years, I
need to do this for myself, to spend some time away from work with my family and friends and reenergize.

Thank you once again for the remarkable opportunity to serve our country and work for the Secretary. This has been a
rare privilege, and I cannot stress enough how appreciative I am. I hold the entire team here in the highest possible
regard.

I am happy to talk through any of this at your convenience.

Thank you again for everything.

Sincerely,
