They are looking for your sign off on this as early this am — the final will have any edits recommended by Jim.

regarding support for the U.S.-Colombia Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA). UNASUR is haying its summit meeting
on August 28 and WHA would like the letter sent as soon as possible so that it can be read and processed before the
summit. Please note that Steinberg himself has NOT signed off on this letter (his staff has), but we are expecting to
hear from him this morning. Please tell me if you think this should be held till he weighs in.
