Subject: RE: Support for Italian Restoration of Cultural Monuments

Berlusconi had asked that each donor country "adopt" a damaged cultural heritage monument, but EUR seems to think
that the Italians would welcome the U.S. initiative which might include help in repairing physical damage to the
University itself but would concentrate primarily on development of human capital. One of Ambassador Bagley's
suggestions was that we work with the Italian Ambassador here, who is well connected to the Prime Minister, to ensure
a positive Italian response.

Is this what the Italians want though?

Subject: RE: Support for Italian Restoration of Cultural Monuments

Cheryl,

          Ambassador Bagley and Kris joined representatives from EUR and ECA today to review where things stand with
respect to launching a public/private partnership in response to PM Berlusconi's appeal to the President. EUR and ECA
will be sending up today a follow-up action memo to the Secretary asking that she approve in principle a partnership in
conjunction with the National Italian American Foundation (NIAF) that would focus largely on raising money for
academic exchanges for students from L'Aquila University, the school of higher education most affected by the
earthquake. This is not exactly the monument rebuilding that PM Berlusconi initially proposed, but it is something very
much in keeping with our mission and of interest to NIAF. Ambassador Bagley and Kris had a number of suggestions that
will help EUR and ECA as we move forward especially in selecting the right people to help with fund raising and making
sure the Italian Government welcomes this initiative. Dan

Elizabeth/Kris:

Dan Smith, the Secretary's Executive Secretary, will be connecting you with folks in EUR and ECA with respect to a
commitment from the Secretary to assist Italy in the restoration post-earthquake of certain cultural monuments.

Best.
