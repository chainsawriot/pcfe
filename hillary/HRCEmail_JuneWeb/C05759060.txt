Madam Secretary,

You did a really fine job on Meet the Press today. The Russia, Iran, Afghanistan and Asia points were all right on the
mark. And even though it goes beyond my professional scope, the second half was just as good. Enjoy the rest of the
weekend.

Bill

 Thanks for the update and for all the work you did and led to get us to this point. I hope you'll have time to send me
periodic updates, especially your impressions of the Medvedev-Putin relationship.

  I am considering a trip to the Caucusus and Central Asia in the Fall, perhaps attached to the Russia bilat, if we decide
that makes sense.

 As you know,                                                                                                                1.4(D)
                                                                                                                             B1
 Travel safely. All the best, Hillary

Madam Secretary,

                                                                                                                        1.4(B)
Just a quick note before leaving for Moscow, Rome and Central Asia.                                                     1.4(D)
                                                                                                                        B1
Moscow preparations are in reasonable shape. Afghan lethal transit agreement is done, and will be signed on Monday.
There's also a broader statement on cooperation on counter-narcotics and reconstruction in Afghanistan. (Bakiyev has
now signed the Manas agreement, which is a further boost on Afghanistan.)

                                                                      The Presidents will announce the bilateral
commission, and your trip to Russia in the fall to launch the process with Lavrov. All in all a good measured realistic
step in our effort to rebuild relations --



I'll be in Rome just for the first, "foreign policy" portion of the G8. We're working on a Leaders' statement that is likely
to look a lot like last week's G8 Foreign Ministers statement on most issues, with an update on North Korea, and
essentially the same, firm line on Iran.

I leave Rome on July 9 with an interagency delegation for stops in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan,
back in DC on July 14.

Hope you had a good Fourth, and all the best,

Bill
