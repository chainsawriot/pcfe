P.J.

I am stuck with one of those confounded calendar stories -- Hillary's 100 days. Just got off the phone with Elliott
Abrams, thinking Pd give the dark side their due, but even he was at a loss. "I can't think of anything very critical,
but give me time," said he.

Who knew he had a sense of humor?

Cheers

Rich
