                         Meeting Between DSE Farmer and President Preval
                                        (October 25, 2009)

                                                                                                              1.4(B
                                                                                                              1.4(D)
                                                                                                              B1




        PEF then spoke to RP about the OSE's concerns particularly in regards to how the
        move would be received by the international community and how this would affect
        stability in Haiti. PEF stressed that the positive momentum which had been
        generated over the last six months could easily be undone if the private sector
        perceived the PM's dismissal as a sign of instability. The majority of their
        conversation took place in Creole so PEF is confident that nothing was lost in
        translation.

      Towards the end of our meeting the President invited Michel Cleric (MC) (Vice
      President of the Senate) to join our meeting. MC clearly was present in order to
      back RP's assertions regarding MPL.




      RP stressed to us that his friendship with WJC was very important to him. He
      asked PEF to relay the message that he felt his successes in Haiti were also WJC's
      successes. RP requested that both WJC and the State Department not take any
      substantive action this week or release any statements until he has had an
      opportunity to convene his new administration. PEF reminded RP at this time and

     on several other occasions that he represented the OSE and WJC as Special Envoy
     and hence could not speak on behalf of the State Department or the US Government
     generally.

     Following the meeting with RP, while at the airnort PEF received a call from MPL
     who called to discuss the political situation.
