Congresswoman's son-in-law dies snorkeling



August 12, 2009 4:29 PM I UPDATED STORY




The son-in-law of U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-III.) died Sunday in a snorkeling accident as he vacationed in Mexico with
his family, her office and family said.

Michael McLaughlin, 38, was with Schakowsky and other family members near Tulum, Mexico, at the beginning of a
week long vacation, Schakowsky's husband Robert Creamer said.

McLaughlin was married to Lauren, 35, who is the daughter of Schakowsky's husband and his previous wife Day Piercy,
who lives in New York.

McLaughlin was a filmmaker and editor who lived with his wife in Queens, N.Y.

Creamer said he and other family members were in their hotel near Solinon Bay when another guest with binoculars
told them there appeared to be a problem with McLaughlin, who was snorkeling in the bay about 7 miles north of
Tul urn.

Creamer was the first to reach McLaughlin in a kayak. He said he found his son-in-law face down in the water, and called
out to him but got no response. Creamer said he got closer, turned his son-in-law over and realized he was in trouble. He
administered mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and put a life vest on him, Creamer said.

"I yelled at him and poked at him and got no response, so I turned him over and it was clear he wasn't breathing," said
Creamer.

McLaughlin's wife then showed up along with Schakowsky and others in more kayaks to help put McLaughlin on a kayak
in the nearly 7-feet of water. Others also arrived in more kayaks to assist and pulled the craft carrying McLaughlin onto
the beach where they continued to try to revive him unsuccessfully.

McLaughlin was pronounced dead at a local hospital a short time later, Creamer said.

In a phone interview from Mexico, Creamer said McLaughlin was an experienced snorkeler and diver who liked to
snorkel alone, a coroner's report said he had aspirated in his mask and died of asphyxiation, he said.

McLaughlin was cremated, following his own request, Creamer said.

Creamer described himself as heartbroken and praised his son-in-law and the 7-year marriage to his daughter. The
couple had planned to adopt their first child in September.

"Michael was one of the most loving and creative people I've ever met.... and he and my daughter Lauren had one of
the most loving marriages I have ever seen," Creamer said.

In 2005 Schakowsky's daughter-in-law Fiona died of cancer. She had been married to Schakowsky's son Ian.

Born Oct. 26, 1970, in Berkeley, Calif., McLaughlin was the oldest of three children and grew up in "the shadow of Mount
Tamalpais, in Mann County," according to Creamer.

As a young man, McLaughlin was known for his love for the outdoors as his dinner table quips that entertained his
family. As a young adult, he attended Sarah Lawrence College where he studied theater and moved with a friend to New
York City, following college.

His family said McLaughlin never lost his zest for adventure, regularly white water rafting, skydiving, backpacking and
studying Karate.

McLaughlin later moved to San Francisco, where he met his wife Lauren and married her in July 2002. During their
marriage, McLaughlin helped his wife start her own business and she helped him pursue his film career as a filmmaker,
his family said.

During McLaughlin's career he worked in live theater, puppetry and short fiction. His short film "Shadow Puppets of
Doom" was shown in film festivals and won the "Best Screenplay" award in the Mann County Film Festival, his family
said. At the time of his death he was filming a pilot reality television show.

McLaughlin is survived by his wife, Lauren Creamer McLaughlin, his mother, Rohana, his sister, Halima, and his brother,
Marlin.
