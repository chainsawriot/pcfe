I just spoke to torn (see b/1)..

He thinks for the moment a call by you is not indicated - first, Zeleya was unpersuadable by 2am by even his closet allies
and second, tom said folks appear to stepping away from him.

He intends to fly mid-day so there will be plenty of time for more discussion over next several hours.

Update:

-- Resolution suspending Honduras passed with a roll call vote, requested by the Caribbeans, 33-0. Honduras did not
vote.

-- Strong push by key countries, including Mexico and Costa Rica, to try to convince Zelaya not to return today.

  Zelaya seems intent on returning. If no other presidents travel with him, Insulza feels under an obligation to
accompany.

-- I am touching bases now to figure out what latest state of play is; I think we could have a busy Sunday.
