Subject: RE: Colombian President Uribe would like to speak with the Secretary this evening

My guess is that he is calling about Honduras. He, like many other leaders with an interest in Central America, is worried
that Honduras is slipping towards confrontation and violence. He probably does not think Insulza is up to the task. S
should be aware that Arias is prepared to offer his services. I spoke with the Costa Rican FonMin, who said the de facto
government has reached out to Arias, and that the Costa Ricans will be looking for a way to make the offer to
Zelaya. Uribe knows Zelaya and has some influence. Uribe might want to talk with Arias and offer to help move Zelaya
in the right direction. (Although Uribe and Zelaya come from different ends of the political spectrum, they are both
ranchers and love horses, and this has created some comradeship.)

Colombian President Uribe has requested to speak with Secretary Clinton. His staff said he is available this evening, but
they did not provide specific availabilities for tomorrow.

Please advise.
