Subject: this week?
Secretary Clinton,

I hope that all is well back in the States and just wanted to let you know that I will be in Washington
Wednesday. If you might have a minute to spare to follow up on your last message in person or by phone this
week or over the weekend, I would very much appreciate the opportunity. Congratulations on the Europe
trip!

Yours sincerely, Jackie
