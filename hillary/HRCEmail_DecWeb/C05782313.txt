Dear Hillary,

This is indeed still my email. I am sorry I missed your call. I listened to your message and tried to call you back but your
cell did not pick up. I am honored by your invitation to join the new board you are setting up. Let me know when it
would be convenient to schedule a call. I will be in the US through September 5, then away for two weeks, and then in
NYC-DC during the week of September 19.




Have a wonderful vacation. I am delighted by the prospect of working with you.

Laura

Hi, Laura--

It's Hillary Clinton. I just called your cell and left a message, but I thought I'd find out whether you were still reachable
thru this address because I'd like to talk w you at your convenience.
