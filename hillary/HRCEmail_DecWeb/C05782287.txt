Subject: Thursday - Cathy

Had a brief conversation with Tony. I will probably speak to him again tonight our time.
                                                                                                                     1.4(B)
                                                                                                                     1.4(D)
                                                                                                                     B1

Tony had a 50 minute phone call with Cathy.




                                                                                              Have set up meetings with
him and Abu Mazen after TB first sees Cathy in Brussels.

BTW, David, have you heard from Serry in the last few days on any of this? Many thanks, Rob
