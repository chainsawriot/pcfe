Cheryl

This is an international organization position, for which the USG nominates a candidate to the international organization
itself.

We can put up anyone — career or non-career

There is no guarantee that US candidate will be accepted

And individual and USG have to lobby the organization to get our candidate accepted

Regards

Richard Boucher, who currently serves as Deputy Secretary General for the OECD, is departing in 2013. See further
details in cable below.

           ants to be the U.S. nominee for this role.

I told          his was the first I had heard of this, and unsure what our selection process would be at this time or if there
were other candidates in mind.

I can speak with the US Mission at OECD on how our selection process worked in 2009 (I don't recall).

Let me know thoughts on how to proceed.

Thx

 1. (SBU) Summary: The United States must quickly identify a successor for OECD Deputy
 Secretary General Richard Boucher who says he will leave Paris in 2013. The ideal candidate
 is a francophone political economist of at least ambassadorial rank with experience in Europe
 plus Latin America and/or Asia. Diversity is key; we strongly recommend identifying a
 qualified female candidate. Currently, the Secretary General and all four Deputy Secretaries
 General are men. End summary.

  2. (SBU) Deputy Secretary General (DSG) Richard Boucher informed mission officers that he
  intends to leave his position in 2013. The USG should identify strong, qualified, dynamic U.S.
  citizen candidates to fill this position. Traditionally an American holds one of the four DSG
  jobs. Former U.S. ambassadors such as Richard Hecklinger and Boucher have performed
  well. Secretary General Gurria, who will have enormous sway in any final choice, would
  expect an American of a certain caliber to take over. We understand he would prefer someone
 •more "political" in nature -- i.e., closely connected to the President. Currently one DSG is a

former Belgian Prime Minister; another is a former Japanese Deputy Finance Minister. Gurria
previously served as Mexico's Foreign and Finance Minister.

3. (SBU) USOECD believes the ideal candidate combines strong political economic and
economic policy background with proven diplomatic skills. Multilateral experience would be
helpful, but not crucial. He or she should appeal to big and small European, Latin American,
and North East Asian governments. G7 imprimatur is necessary, APEC OECD member (New
Zealand, Australia, Japan, Chile, Mexico, Korea, and Canada) support would be
useful. French skills are a big plus. In light of the OECD's new outward orientation,
development or developing country experience and entrée with Chinese, Indian, and Brazilian
interlocutors would also be advantageous. To the extent possible, the USG should seek diverse
candidates, particularly women, to fill the position.

4. (SBU) The United States must act quickly to identify and advocate for a single nominee or
a very short list of preferred candidates. USOECD and Washington officials should begin
selling that choice to key Member states and preparing the ground with the Secretary General
early in 2013. Gurria, in his inimitable style, would certainly fill any vacuum by choosing and
lobbying strongly for his hand-picked American DSG (whoever that might be). A cautionary
tale: mission officers were told that DSG Rintaro Tamaki, who arrived in 2011, was not the
Government of Japan's choice. Rather, the Secretary General presented Tamaki to members as
a fait accompli. Tamaki is a capable, thoughtful, and intelligent man, but defers to Gurria. He
has been a "low-impact" DSG, especially on important development-related issues. Belgian
Yves Leterme has also failed to make his mark in his first year. Pier Carlo Padoan — the Italian
DSG who is also the OECD's Chief Economist and leads the Economic Directorate — was
sidelined in the important "New Challenges to Economic Challenges" discussions despite
being a highly regarded economist; In contrast, Boucher has been dynamic, focused, and
proactive as he pursues engagement with emerging economic powers and enlargement —
exactly what the OECD needs to remain modern and relevant (per QDDR instructions
regarding multilateral organizations). He serves Gurria well, but is no shrinking violet.

5. (SBU) Comment: Mission urges serious State and interagency action to identify best
candidates to replace Boucher so that we will be in the driver's seat on this selection. As the
"face" of OECD's outreach to emerging economies and developing countries, this position is
challenging and offers the potential to deeply enhance the organization's global
relevance. End comment.
