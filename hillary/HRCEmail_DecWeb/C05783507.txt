Subject: Flood recovery for Thailand

Kurt and Jake:

Thanks for the great support. Attached is the combined package we've put together on flood recovery for Thailand. It
includes elements from PACOM, USAID and INL. For blackberry convenience, I've pasted it below too.

Many of the elements will be on-going before the S arrives:

           PACOM/III MEF forward elements begin arriving in about 12 hours.
           Medical missions start Monday w US/Thai Army
           Water pumps arrive this weekend. Will be ready for the S to "turn over".
           Police support — additional boats arrive Monday/Tuesday.

Other elements will take longer to execute.

Hope all goes well in Hawaii,

Kristie
