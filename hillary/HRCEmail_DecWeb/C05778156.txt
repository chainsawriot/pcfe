Ambassador, Attached is the proposed revised co-branding of the US flag and the USAID logo for your consideration.
Please note when you open the attached, you need to hit close and then hit "web layout" in order to view on screen the
proposed branding with the US Flag and the USAID logo. If the attached is what you envisioned, the next step is for me
to send this to AID/W to ensure they send us final concurrence so we can get this out to our implementing partners as
quickly as possible. Thank you. Denise
