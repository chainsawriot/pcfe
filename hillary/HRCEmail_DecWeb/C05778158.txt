Just talked to him. He sent me points. They are hi side and quite sensitive. I can secure fax them to you if that works.

As you know he wants you to deliver a basic message that you understand his predicament and you want to help. I
talked         about a strong caveat to that message, which is that events are moving fast and we can't make any           B5
promises. e will do our best to keep control of the process and avoid putting him in a corner, but we also have to
make sure this doesn't get away from us.


I will also conve         hat Kerry should not be going to Damascus.                                                       B5
