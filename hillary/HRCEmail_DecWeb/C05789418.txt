I met with Simoes today following up on his and Minister Patriota's trip to Haiti. He was happy with the trip. He said
Patriota had delivered a solid and strong message to Preval, and had enjoyed the opportunity to engage with Brazilian
MINUSTAH troops and the international community. He especially appreciated the chance to speak with Ken Merton,
who Simoes described as a "good guy, very balanced, and with a lot of knowledge about Haiti."

He was happy that you, Cheryl, were pleased with our cooperation during the electoral dispute. He said resolving th€B1
issue of Celestine's candidacy through the CEP and the OAS was the best result possible.
                                                                                                                    1.4(B)

events went well, and the GoB is pleased with the outcome of our pretty intensive diplomatic engagement on Haiti. We
should have a clear idea what we next want to accomplish                                                                   B5
