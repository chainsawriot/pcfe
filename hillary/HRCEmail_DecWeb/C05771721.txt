Today the Federal Police arrested Diego, the man who orchestrated the murders of our three colleagues in Juarez. Last
week the actual killer pleaded guilty in the US. We were able to negotiate his transfer

                   nvestigations continue into others involved in this and other murders in Mexico. Thank you for your
support.
