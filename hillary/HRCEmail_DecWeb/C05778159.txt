If you read Carlos's hi side memo, you can see why I'm worried about going empty-handed to see Calderon. So, we need
something more that pledges of support.

Just talked to him. He sent me points. They are hi side and quite sensitive. I can secure fax them to you if that works.




As you know, he wants you to deliver a basic message that you understand his predicament and you want to help. I
talked          about a strong caveat to that message, which is that events are moving fast and we can't make any
promises. We will do our best to keep control of the process and avoid putting him in a corner, but we also have to
make sure this doesn't get away from us.




I will also convey F7that Kerry should not be going to Damascus.
