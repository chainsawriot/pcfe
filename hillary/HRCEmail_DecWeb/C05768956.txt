Hope you are well.

The following memo was sent to S, which she read yesterday morning. After reading it, she decided she wanted to share
it personally with Secretary Gates at yesterday's hearing.

Because they did not get a chance to speak afterwards, she didn't get to hand it to him, echoing her thoughts on it.


Welcome your assistance in providing this directly to him.


Thanks.

Cdm
