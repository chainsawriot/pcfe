Before you give Tom an attaboy, Dawn.com is reporting:

"According to a person close to the negotiations, Nides guaranteed that Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar and her
extended family will have full use of the Clinton home on Whitehaven Street, with the exception of Labor Day weekend
and two weekends in August. The former president and current Secretary of State agreed to pay for utilities, though Ms.
Khar will be responsible for pool maintenance."

Still a good deal.

Madam Secretary,

Secretary Panetta just called me to ask that I convey to you his deep thanks for your stewardship of this negotiation with
Pakistan. It was the right outcome. As you recommended in Chicago, having the Nides-Miller dream team close this deal
was the smart strategic move.

Secretary Panetta also asked that I wish you and President Clinton a great Fourth of July.

Best regards,
