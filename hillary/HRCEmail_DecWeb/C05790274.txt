Fyi, tomorrow is 682...



White House logs only show some visits: Hillary really does show up more often By Emily Heil Washington Post
05:59 PM ET, 05/23/201

Our post Tuesday about which Cabinet secretaries visit the White House the most often--and least often--triggered
outrage in some quarters.

It's true that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton only showed up on visitor logs 33 times. But her spokesman, Philippe
Reines, informed us that's only a fraction of the 681 trips his boss has made to the storied structure.

The Post's database of White House visitor logs doesn't tell the whole story. The logs only reflect the information the
White House chooses to record. It certainly doesn't show what regular guests some Cabinet secretaries are at the
campus centered around 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.--which we explained by noting that "bigwigs...most often get waved
in," rather than having to get logged in like the rest of the commoners.

Cabinet secretaries sometimes get the formal log-in treatment at official events at the White House--often when they
are accompanied by spouses or other family members to events like state dinners or barbeques.

So in case it wasn't clear, Clinton, and other members of the Cabinet, are hardly strangers to the White House. Just,
apparently, to the visitors' logs.
