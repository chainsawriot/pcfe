Outstanding news! Miki Rakic called about 10 minutes ago to pass along that Goran Hadzic was
arrested this morning in the Frushka Gora region of Vojvodina. He is on his way to Belgrade now for
questioning, etc. Should appear before the War Crimes Court and be on his way to The Hague
within 4-5 days. Tadic is giving a press conference at 11am. We will follow up with Miki and BIA to get
additional details as soon as we can. Will also keep an eye out for any Brammertz statement.

I recommend a welcoming statement from the Secretary and the WH, if at all possible, noting the
significance of this arrest for finally closing the chapter on Serbia's obligations to the Tribunal.
