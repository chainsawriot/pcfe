I asked Z to say tomorrow that he's directed/agreed to a negotiation over cost per container to get GLOCs open and that
he's committed to working w NATO ISAF to stabilize Af. Not much but should be able to get that.

Cameron still trying to nail down with Sherry. All still slippery. Will check in with him again.

Looks like Hamas has moved off their opposition to elections so the Egyptians are saying we're headed to a technocratic
government. So we'll have to manage that.
