Spokesman for the MFA quoted in press today saying that Danish request for transfer of Alkhawaja to Denmark has
been "referred to the high court for decision." We'll try to confirm status of case today and get a readout of his physical
condition. Note that neither Danish ambassador nor Red Cross doctor, who see Alkhawaja everyday, have reported
mistreatment or abuse. I will raise urgency of decision with CP today (meeting at 1200).

The window seems to be closing pretty fast. If we don't see movement by mid-day tomorrow Manama time - I would
favor an S call.

Abdulhadi AlKhawaja called his family. According to his daughter Zainab AlKhawaja (who was released this
afternoon after getting arrested on Thursday night) he can hardly speak, and he can hardly breath. He took very
long pauses between every word, as he told his wife about the mistreatment he is receiving from the military
hospital staff and the guards. He said that when they treated him badly he said to them "I will not accept this. I
lived free and proud outside your prison and I live free and proud inside." He told them if they didn't improve
their treatment and allow him to talk to his family he will stop drinking water as well. He also said he will not
stop his hungerstrike and he has told the guards "if I die, I die with dignity."

According to his lawyer, Mohamed AlJishi, AlKhawaja has asked to be transferred to another hospital because
of the mistreatment he is receiving at the military hospital.

Zainab Alkhawaja arrested again:
In other urgent news, Zainab Alkhawaja went to the Bahrain Defense force hospital where her father Abdulhadi
is being held around 5 hours ago. According to a pro-government website Zainab was screaming "Baba
(father)" inside the hospital, she was handcuffed to a wheelchair and taken to the security office. Zainab's family
and lawyer have not been allowed access to her, and she has not been allowed to make a phone call. Her family
is very concerned about her well being and safety. Her family is considering this a kidnapping as the authorities
have not released anything official or informed the family or lawyer that she has been arrested. Zainab was last
heard from or seen around 5 hours ago.

Note: the Bahrain Defense Force hospital is the same hospital where Abdulhadi Alkhawaja had a surgery last
year after his jaw was broken during arrest, and where he was reportedly tortured according to BICI report case
8.
