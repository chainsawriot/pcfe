Subject: Fwd: Camp David in big trouble

If HRC is going she should be very blunt with Morsi that this is not living up to Egypt's international
obligations. And we should be sure that others pass the same message. They can be responsible and gain
material support or they can act irresponsibly and create a climate where they get neither assistance or
investment. It is up to them.

           MB MP Khaled Deeb informed me today that MB will push to review Camp David and put it to
           a referendum. The argument is that this would still be "respecting" Camp David, because it is
           Israel that supposedly violates Camp David, and the MB/Egypt will no longer tolerate
           it. (People who say this never cite specific examples of Israel breaking the treaty, naturally.)
           Making matters worse, the MB MP said he believed the reports of attacks on Israel from Sinai
           were invented. So walk through the chain of foreseeable events: Israel will be attacked from
           Sinai (this is an inevitability); it may respond; MB will claim that Israel fired first, and therefore
           broke the treaty, "like it always does," etc. And then the treaty, the MB will argue, is broken.

           And making matter even worse: the Egyptian MFA official that I hung out with last night made
           the exact same argument, and similarly believed that the reports of attacks on Israel from Sinai
           were invented. (This particular official will be Egypt's next mission chief in Tehran, and is an
           ambassador.) So the MB's views on Camp David have at least some support within Egypt's
           diplomatic corps.
