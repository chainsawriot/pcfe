Subject:                           Egypt statement



Millions of Egyptians voted this past weekend in an election to choose a new president democratically, reflecting their
aspirations for a President and government chosen by the Egyptian people, that will work for the Egyptian people. This
is a critical moment in Egypt, and the world is watching closely. We are particularly concerned by decision that appear
to prolong the military's hold on power. We look to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces to restore popular and
international confidence in the democratic transition process by following through on their stated commitment to an
inclusive constitutional drafting process, the timely seating of a democratically elected parliament, and the swift,
permanent transfer of power to a civilian government. As the Secretary said, there can be no going back on the
democratic transition, and the United States stands with the Egyptian people in their aspiration to choose their own
leaders.

If pressed on whether aid will be affected:

The decisions taken in this crucial period will naturally have an impact on the nature of our engagement with the
government and the SCAF moving forward.
