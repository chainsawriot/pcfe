Hi Cheryl,

I saw you last night across the crowded room but didn't get a chance to talk to you before
you left.

I wanted to thank you for all that you did for HRC, for the Dept, and for our country
throughout these four tumultuous years. Her unparalleled success as Secretary of State was in
no small part because of your vigilance, integrity, intellect and political savvy - you
always had her back, as they say, and from one who prizes and practices loyalty above all
else, I have always respected and admired that quality in you and you did not disappoint as
Chief of Staff.

  also wanted to thank you for working with me during some difficult times,

                     - and for supporting my efforts and guiding me through the shoals of the
mission impossible task of raising the funds to build the US Diplomacy Center. For the
record, we have now raised $36.5 mil towards our goal of $50 mil and I am committed to having
her return next year for the dedication of the glass pavilion, which will bear her name!

To that end, I've told John Kerry that I will stay to finish this job

           - so I'm sure that our paths will cross again at some point.

In the meantime, I'll be reachable on this email or on my personal
email:                        and I hope that you will let me know where and how to reach you
in the future.

Congratulations on a masterful tenure here at State - you're a true professional and a good
and honest person - indispensable qualities for a Chief of Staff - and I've learned so much
from your example.

Good luck in your next endeavor and I hope you take a break to enjoy
before you go on to save another world!

Warmest regards,

Elizabeth
