Can't do--and shouldn't. Can you point out scheduling hurdles to regret.

Cheryl,
         Thanks again for your great help on the President's words.
Could you check to see if the following is even feasible.
         In light of our community's love for Sec. Clinton's we would love to celebrate her at our community's largest
event -- our conference of the country's clergy and lay leaders from our 500 churches across America. Lead by
Archbishop Demetrios, it is taking place in this summer in Phoenix, Arizona on July 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th.
         If it is possible, we can accommodate her whenever she would like during those dates, although the grand
banquet the evening of July 5th is the best.
         Thanks again.

Andy
