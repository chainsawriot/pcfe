I understand you are talking to her about the McHale job.

Without exaggeration, Tara is one of the most talented people I have ever worked with -- in government or out.

She is razor sharp, politically astute, with a great sense and understanding of communicating foreign policy effectively.
She works incredibly hard. She will be completely loyal. She has the respect of the foreign policy community.

There is noone I would rather be in a foxhole with (and indeed have been more than once).

This is a perfect time in her life/career to take on this challenge.

I'd grab her.

Best, Sandy
