Fyi â€” I think I forgot to forward this to you last week.

               s interested in serving in a COM post. I told Anne I would pass along his interest. I will find out what
countries he is interested in that are up for rotation in 2013, and can send his information to PPO as well.

Thx

Dear Heather,

Just to confirm what we decided a week ago:              would appreciate it if you raised his name with Cheryl Mills
as a candidate for a 2nd term Obama Ambassadorship, to take the place of an Ambassador rotating out in 2013.

If you don't mind, would you call him at some point to discuss? No rush. His number is                     He can give you
a better sense of where he'd be interested in serving. I believe the list is something like this 1) Germany
                              , 2) Sri Lanka                                      or 3) developing countries in Africa,
                                                            The only caveat to this last is he would prefer not to be posted
to a French-speaking country

Thanks very much.

      - Anne
