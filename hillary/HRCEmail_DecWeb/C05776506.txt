I think he will want to hear directly from "his friends" in those countries. So calls will be more credible.

We can work up a letter from you to Voinovich on this if that would be best way to close the loop.

Our Ambassador spoke this afternoon to the Latvian Political Director and he said that Latvia does not have any
concerns and in fact MFA is proposing that President Zatlers laud the new START in his remarks at UNGA

Lithuania:




Our A/DCM spoke this afternoon with the Lithuanian Political Director and the poldir expressed surprise that there was
any question about Lithuanian support for START. They have no problems with START and welcome it. The poldir
speculated that perhaps someone was conflating START with real Lithuanian concern over A/CFE (even as they welcome
our strong consultation with them as the A/CFE process moves ahead).
