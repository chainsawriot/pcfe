Cheryl:

I have received numerous email's and 3 phone calls from                                             They felt it was a
remarkable articulation of a very complex concept and one critical to taking Global Health forward(paraphrase).
said he should switch his party affiliation (he still thinks he is a Republican).

You and 'S' should feel especially good. You for your strong orchestration of the message as it came down to the wire
and 'S' for her compassionate and classy delivery as only she can do. I believe it will continue to ripple.

It is an honor to work for you both.

Eric
