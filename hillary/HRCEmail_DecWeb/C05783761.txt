Dear Cheryl,

Two quick things beside a thank you for your work in the world:

[1]
                                                                                 I know she admires Doar
from her work on the Nixon impeachment committee.

[2] Do you know the proper channel at the White House to suggest Doar for the Medal of Freedom? (One of my
former co-authors, Bill Russell, received it this year.) If so, I'd appreciate any tip on the process.


Best,
Taylor Branch
