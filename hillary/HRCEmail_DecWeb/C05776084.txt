Dear Cheryl:

I wanted to inform you about the current status of the nomination process for my re-election as President of the Bank
that began on 10 May and will remain open through 24 June.

As of this date, I have been nominated by 24 countries, 20 of them regional member countries, representing 48.894 % of
the voting power.

The list of countries is as follows: Argentina, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, El
Salvador, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal, Uruguay, Trinidad
and Tobago, Korea, Japon, Netherlands y Canada.

Consequently, my nomination fulfills the first requirement of nominations by at least of 15 regional member countries;

 The second requirement, a majority of the total voting power of all the Bank's shareholders, is almost fulfilled as of
today.(51 %)

Further, no other candidates have been nominated as of this date.

Last meeting on Wednesday 26 , the Board of Executive Directors gave the approval for the special meeting of the
Board of Governors for the election of the President of the Bank to be held at the Bank's headquarters in Washington,
D.C. on 6 July 2010, as recommended by the Governor for Mexico, in his capacity as Chairman of the Board of
Governors.

I hope to see you soon at the Bank as we spoke in your office the last time we visited with you.

Regards,
Lam
