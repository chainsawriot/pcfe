Re: Win This War


    1. Quinnipiac poll this morning shows Obama at his lowest approval and defeated for reelection 50-41 because of
       Libya. (See below.) No time for panic. Time to prevent panic.
    2. Pat Lang argues for intensified bombing. I understand the bombing continues. Whatever it is, it is not enough.
    3. Of course, victory cannot be achieved without the rebels gaining ground, getting to the gates of Tripoli, an
       uprising, and marching in. They must have training and armor piercing weapons. If US, UK and France can't
       provide this, then the rebels should secure it elsewhere. Sotto voce.
    4. The case for the US interest should be made in light of what a Q victory would mean. That is the negative case,
       but perhaps most effective. The positive case for national interest in terms of removing Q, establishing stability in
       North Africa, securing democracy in Egypt and Tunisia, economic development, effect throughout Arab world and
       Africa, extending US influence, counter-balancing Iran, etc., should be obvious. It is a vital national interest today,
       now, at this moment. The humanitarian motive offered is limited, conditional and refers to a specific past situation.
       Having avoided a massacre at Benghazi, constantly claiming credit for it as though seeking gratitude from people
       (Libyans and American public opinion), soon reaches a counter-productive point. (This reminds me of Obama's
       message for the midterms, demanding gratitude from the public for avoiding a deeper recession, something that
       was not experienced.) I infer Gates' problem is losing an internal debate. Tyler, who knows him well, says, "He's a
       mean, vicious little prick." You may have another view. Whatever his alleged virtues, his public statements have
       been transparently calculated to be undermining and have achieved that effect.
    5. Read the poll. Win the war. No way out.

Obama, soon to be defeated in Libya?

After listening to Obama's speech last night and observing the relative lack of air action today I would say that Obama
appears to be intent on seizing defeat from the jaws of victory.
He and his political cronies in the WH and in Chicago are, to say the least, unenthusiastic about regime change in Libya
or anywhere else in the ME. Why is that? Hmmm.
Obama's lukewarm and self contradicting statements have produced what is at least for the moment, operational
paralysis. Think about it, if you were Carter Ham or any number of other NATO senior officers how could you avoid
thinking that you are very exposed as a probable scape goat if a claim is made that you somehow exceeded your
"instructions?"
The rebels are a rabble? Certainly, but so are Qathafi's people. The rebel "ranks" may contain people who fought us in
Iraq? Probably, but we do not actually know that except on the word of Qathafi and persistent suggestions in the MSM by
people who have no way to know.
NATO air power is ineffective in built up areas? Rubbish. Go look at the satellite photographs of these towns, Sirte, etc.,
on Google Earth. They are mostly open space with a few palm trees. The tanks, rocket artillery launchers, armored
personnel carriers and AAA guns on trucks of Qathafi's people are all quite exposed. USAF has now brought AC-130s
and A-10s into the action. These aircraft are well suited for engagement of targets in these towns or anywhere along the
road. The metal masses in these weapons are very detectable by the aircraft night or day.
Obama should think about the political effect here in the US of defeat by Qathafi's puny forces. He wants to be re-
elected? It would be interesting to see how his prospects would be affected by Qathafi's continuing presence in Tripoli in
November 2012 and the mockery that the Republicans will rain down on him over his present weakness. pl

March 30, 2011 - Obama Gets Lowest Approval, Reelect Score Ever, Quinnipiac
University National Poll Finds; More Voters Oppose U.S. Involvement In Libya




American voters disapprove 48 - 42 percent of the job President Barack Obama is doing and say 50 - 41
percent he does not deserve to be re-elected in 2012, both all-time lows, according to a Quinnipiac University
poll released today.

This compares to a 46 - 46 percent job approval rating and a 45 - 47 percent split on the President's re-election
in a March 3 survey by the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University. In a hypothetical 2012
matchup, President Obama gets 36 percent of the vote to 37 percent for an unnamed Republican challenger.

Democrats approve 80 - 13 percent of the job Obama is doing, but disapproval is 81 - 9 percent among
Republicans and 50 - 39 percent among independent voters. Men disapprove 52 - 41 percent while women split
44 - 44 percent.

Voters oppose 47 - 41 percent America's involvement in Libya. In the survey concluded Monday evening as
President Obama was addressing the nation about Libya, voters say 58 - 29 percent that he has not clearly
stated U.S. goals for Libya.

American voters give conflicting signals about U.S. involvement in Libya:

    •    They approve 53 - 35 percent of using cruise missiles to destroy Libya's air defense;
    •    They say 48 - 41 percent the U.S. should not use military force to remove Moammar Gadhafi from
         power;
    •    They say 65 - 27 percent the U.S. should use military force to protect civilians from Gadhafi.

"President Barack Obama's approval numbers are at their lowest level ever, slightly below where they were for
most of 2010 before he got a bump up in surveys after the November election and into the early part of this
year," said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.

"Some reasons for his overall numbers might be that Obama receives negative ratings on his handling of the
budget deficit, the economy, foreign policy, health care and energy policy."

American voters split 46 - 45 percent on whether protecting Libyan civilians from Gadhafi is a goal worth
having U.S. troops "fight and possibly die." And voters say 61 - 30 percent that removing Gadhafi is not worth
having American troops "fight and possibly die."

A total of 62 percent of voters are "very confident" or "somewhat confident" that the U.S. mission to protect
Libyan civilians from Gadhafi will be successful.

But 74 percent of voters are "very concerned" or "somewhat concerned" that the U.S. will get embroiled in a
long-term military conflict in Libya.

The pattern of political support for the president regarding Libya is somewhat different than with the war in
Afghanistan, for which public support continues to deteriorate. Now, 50 percent of voters say the U.S. should
not be involved in that conflict while 41 percent says it is the right thing to do.

"Republicans have been the strongest supporters of the Democratic president's policy. Currently, 50 percent of
Republicans, 38 percent of Democrats and 38 percent of independent voters support the effort in Afghanistan,"
Brown said.

"On Libya, 48 percent of Democrats but only 40 percent of Republicans and 38 percent of independent voters
voice support."

From March 22 - 28, Quinnipiac University surveyed 2,069 registered voters with a margin of error of +/- 2.2
percentage points. Live interviewers call land lines and cell phones.
