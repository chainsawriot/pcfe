Subject:                          the role of women in the Middle East



I have been monitoring (and broadcasting) a growing number of articles re the important role of women in ME protests.
I gather that POTUS is going to give a big speech on US policy re the Arab Spring; I hope that he can say something about
women more than just in passing. I am happy to send along sources/text if it would be helpful. Happy Easter!
All best,
AM
