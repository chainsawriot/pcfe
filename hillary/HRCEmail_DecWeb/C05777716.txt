Latest from our charge Stephanie williams in bahrain

Per your request, here is comprehensive update on where we are in terms of the developing situation in Bahrain. In
addition to the timeline below, we've heard that a GCC extraordinary Foreign Ministerial is being held this
afternoon/evening after which the Foreign Minister will hold a press conference. I heard from the Minister's office that
the call with S is confirmed for 1530 our time and we understand that SECDEF will be speaking with the Crown Prince an
hour later.

tomorrow and there were already plans underway for a mass rally after Friday prayers.
