Christine LaGarde spoke to Morsi a few minutes ago. She thought it went well. She told him they were "ready and
eager" to send a team once E had a finance minister and a government. IMF's sense is that it will take a bit of time to
form a government, so they will adjust their travel plans accordingly.

I will stay in touch with the Fund and will keep you up to date.
