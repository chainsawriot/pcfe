Dear friend,
Thank you for your e-mail.
I think it is a good idea to come to Qatar.
June 15 is good with me.
Looking forward to seeing you.

Best regards.

 Dear Friend,



 Thank you for your letter through Ambassador Ziadeh. I deeply appreciate your efforts to promote peace and
 reconciliation in Afghanistan.



 I believe that it might be helpful for us to review the state of play in person so that we may share ideas and
 perspectives face-to-face. May I propose to come and call on you in Doha on Friday, June 15 at a time of your
 convenience? I would arrive in Doha Thursday evening. I would leave Doha Saturday morning June 16 as I
 must participate in a meeting of the International Contact Group on Afghanistan in Helsinki, Finland on
 Sunday, June 17.
