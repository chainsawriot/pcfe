Subject: Kenya to stay in Somalia until 'threat' is gone (AP)

NAIROBI, Kenya - (AP)          The chief of Kenya's armed forces says Kenyan troops will stay in southern
Somalia until Kenyans feel safe again.
  Gen. Julius Karangi told reporters Saturday that there was no timeline for the Kenyan operation to end.
Kenya sent troops into Somalia earlier this month after a string of cross-border attacks and kidnappings.
  But Karangi says Kenya has no interest in permanently occupying Somalia and is working alongside the
weak U.N.-backed Somali government, which only holds the capital with the help of 9,000 African Union
soldiers.
  Karangi says that although Kenya has bilateral military agreements with countries like the United States and
Britain, those allies are not directly involved militarily in the incursion into Somalia.
