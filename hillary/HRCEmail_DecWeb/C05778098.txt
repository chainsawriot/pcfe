From our UNAMA colleagues:




The MPs have agreed to a delay of inauguration until Wednesday on the condition that the Special Court is abolished
and only the Supreme Court handles individual criminal cases. They have given the President until 10am Sunday to
respond in a public manner. If there is a negative response, they'll convene the Parliament tomorrow afternoon at 4pm.




More to follow our Sunday morning when we make contact with the key MPs.

Quanooni confirnmed what was noted below and that proposal to the President will be send tonight, giving the deadline
for President's reply by 10am tommorow morning. If he says yes, than inauguration on Wednesday, if not- tommorow
afternoon. MPs will meet again tommorow at 9am at Interconcinental. Quanooni very thankful to IC and in particular
Hillary Clinton for their firm stand.

3rd point on Special Court was not agreed with President and was added by MPs.

I welcomed the emerging deal and we both agreed to stay in close touch.
