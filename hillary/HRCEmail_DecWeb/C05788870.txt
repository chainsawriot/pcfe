Colleagues:

I called dprk deputy un permrep han song-ryol at 1550 today to convey the following points:

- the usg accepts the north korean proposal to hold a bilateral meeting of ambassador glyn and fvfv kim in beijing.

-- we are ready to meet as early as the week of February 13.

-- we understand that may be a difficult week for north koreans, so we are available the following week as well.

I noted that glyn and I depart for moscow tomorrow. I wanted both to avoid unnecessary nk speculation if the trip came
as a surprise right after a new york channel call and also to give pyongyang a chance to respond before we're wheels-up
tomorrow afternoon.

Cheers,

Ford
