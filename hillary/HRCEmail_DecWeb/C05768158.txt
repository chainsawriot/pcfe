Subject                       the navy's view of security -- migration and water



The chief of naval operations, Adm. Gary Roughhead, invited me and a number of other QDDR
folks to dinner at his house last night to talk about how we could work more closely with the Navy.
He is an enormously impressive individual, and I thought you and Cheryl would like to know that
he said the top two security issues of the 21st century are migration and water. He sounded just
like you. Part of what we have to do with the QDDR is establish a better foundation for you, Adm
Mullen, and other service chiefs to make this larger case to the American people. The Navy's
approach to addressing these issues is exactly to convene and connect naval chiefs from around the
world and then to focus them on working together to solve regional problems. AM
