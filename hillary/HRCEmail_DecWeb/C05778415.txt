Personnel-Sensitive

Dear

Greetings from the State Department.

I am providing you the link below so that you may logon to the eQIP system to complete your security
form. Pat Carter will be in touch to provide you some additional forms that you will also need to complete for
the security process and the appointment. Once you have completed the eQIP form, please let Pat know.

To start the process, simply copy the following link and paste into your interne browser or click on it to begin
completing your SF-86 using eQIP: http://www.opm.gov/e-qip/browser-check.asp. Please read and thoroughly
follow the instructions for completing the eQIP form to prevent any unnecessary delays. Once you begin
entering your data in eQIP you may save it and return to it, if necessary, at a later time. One you complete the
application, please print and sign the three releases of the eQIP form (you will be prompted to do this).

Thank you, Sharon Hardy
