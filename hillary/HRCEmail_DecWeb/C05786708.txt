DELIBERATIVE AND PREDECISIONAL

PERSONAL VIEWS ONLY



Cherylâ€”



In addition to the options memo on S/WCI, I wanted to send you some purely personal thoughts about this
issue. (I've seen the memo process as both developing options and also as a process to build stakeholder buy-in
to the idea that S/WCI might move and stakeholder open-mindedness about where S/WCI might move to, and
for many reasons have not wanted to directly inject my personal views into that).

In broad brush, I think about 5 issues when I think about where S/WCI should go:
