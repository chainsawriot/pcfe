From our UNAMA colleagues:

The MPs have agreed to a delay of inauguration until Wednesday on the condition that the Special
Court is abolished and only the Supreme Court handles individual criminal cases. They have given
the President until 10am Sunday to respond in a public manner. If there is a negative response,
they'll convene the Parliament tomorrow afternoon at 4pm.

More to follow    our Sunday morning when we make contact with the key MPs.
