Statement by Secretary Clinton after conversation with Foreign Minister Khar:

I once again reiterated our deepest regrets for the tragic accident in Salala last November; I offered again our sincerest
condolences to the families of the Pakistani soldiers who lost their lives; and we are sorry for the loss of lives on both
sides of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.

We were reminded that our troops — Pakistani and American — are in a fight against a common enemy. In the last month
alone in Pakistan, extremists have killed and wounded hundreds of Pakistanis. We remain committed to confronting the
threat from these extremists on both sides of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border in the continuing fight against
extremists.

As I told PM Gilani days after the Salala accident, America respects Pakistan's sovereignty and is committed to working
together in pursuit of shared objectives on the basis of mutual interests and mutual respect. In today's phone call,
Foreign Minister Khar and I talked about the importance of taking joint action against extremists, who threaten Pakistan,
the United States and the region; of supporting Afghanistan's security, stability, and efforts towards reconciliation; and
of continuing to work together to advance the many other shared interests we have, from increasing trade and
investment to strengthening our people to people ties. We should have a relationship that's enduring and strategic, and
carefully defined. We have enhanced our counter-terrorism cooperation, to include precise efforts against terrorists
that threaten Pakistan and the United States, with the goal of the ultimate destruction of al-Qa'ida. When that happens,
the U.S. counterterrorism role will fundamentally change. Our relationship should be about identifying our shared
interests and acting on them jointly, and this relationship should enhance the security and prosperity of both our
nations and the region.

In addition, I am pleased to say that Foreign Minister Khar has informed me that the ground supply lines into
Afghanistan are open. Pakistan has agreed to maintain the current rates per container. This is a tangible demonstration
of Pakistan's support for a secure, peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan. This is critically important to the men and
women who are fighting terrorism and extremism in Afghanistan.        '
