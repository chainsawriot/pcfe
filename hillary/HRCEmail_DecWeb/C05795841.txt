Subject:                          Noms voted out



Madam Secretary:


 I am sure you have heard, all your noms got through the Senate last night. And at least one of them knows all you
have done to support his nomination and his work over these past years.


 I won't confuse victory and valedictory: today Carol and I are celebrating a success, and are grateful for your backing
every step of the way.


Sincerely,


Joe
