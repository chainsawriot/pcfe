Had a great lunch with Kathy on Wednesday. Covered a lot of topics and told her to call me any time. Was
interesting to get her perspective on all the bureaucratic BS which drove me/us crazy! Getting through that stuff
may be one of the benefits of having an insider --- at least for an interim period of time.

Take care.
