Subject: heads up - muhammed yunus at ag event

Cheryl, Muhammad Yunus RSVPed for the gender and ag event. Will confirm so S can acknowledge
him if appropriate.

Other potential acknowledgements: Russ Carnhan, A/S Brimmer, A/S Fernandez, Melanne, Kris B.

Let me know what time you want to be briefed tomorrow; our walkthrough is at 5pm. We heard from
the DCM in Tanzania that Kikwete intends to accept. Megan is still working on both the ag and
nutrition remarks.

Thanks, Cindy
