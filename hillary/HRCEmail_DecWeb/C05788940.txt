Fred and I had a long mtg with the Moroccan "minister delegate" (#2 in the MFA but with cabinet rank), Yousef Amrani,
today. Amrani is a good guy -- we've known him, for years.




I think basically this is good news for us (even if weird and telling for Morocco's "democracy"), as Yousef is favorably
disposed to us and he's someone I can call easily.

So: I'd like to just take S over to him to say hello on the margins of the UNSC session today.
