Cheryl,


           Please convey to S and to the staffers involved my deep thanks for S raising with NZ Foreign Minister McCully
yesterday the issue of diplomat same-sex spouse work accommodation.


           GNZ's refusal to extend to same-sex spouses (whether married, registered as domestic partners, or otherwise)
the benefits granted to married opposite-sex spouses has caused significant hardship for several members of our
Mission as well as for a comparable number of Kiwi diplomats serving in the U.S.



                                 . FSO's with more limited resources, however, including
            have been severely impacted by the situation.


           Including the issue on the agenda signaled to the Foreign Minister the importance of the issue to USG, and I
suspect that it will prod him into reopening the matter in some fashion, despite his prior flat refusal.


           Thank you.


          - D
