Dear Senator Whitehouse:

Please also let me express my condolences.

Our Consular Affairs staff has been in touch with Ms. Colvin's family



We have been working with the Polish Embassy in Damascus, which is representing the U.S. as our Protecting Power to
recover the remains.

Michelle Bernier-Toth, who is one of our top senior officers and Managing Director of the Department's Office of Citizen
Services, would be glad to speak with whomsoever you designate to keep you abreast of our efforts. She can call that
individual or she can be reached at
202-647-9018 or at Bernier-TothM2@state.gov

I have spoken to Michelle and she and I will assist in any way we can.

Sincerely,

Pat

Patrick F. Kennedy
Under Secretary for Management
