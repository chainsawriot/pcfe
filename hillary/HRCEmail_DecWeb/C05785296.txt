Dear Cheryl,

I just wanted to close the loop with you and thank you for facilitating my invitation to be a guest at last night's SED
dinner. It was an enjoyable and productive evening and frankly had a positive feel to it despite the current issues of the
day between the US and China. Both Secretary Clinton and Secretary Geithner gave excellent remarks, both in tone and
substance. I had an opportunity for an exchange with Hillary after the dinner and it was good to catch up with her given
the tumultuous sequence of events over the past few weeks — and frankly just to give her a hug and squeeze her hand.
And the recent weeks have been good ones for both our country and for the distinguished Secretary, in my opinion.

The evening also provided me with a natural and welcome opportunity to see many old friends and make some new
ones with Chinese government officials who deal directly with the private sector, which is of course important to Mark
and our automotive activities in China. So genuine appreciation — again.

Personally,
Mack

Good morning Mack

Please wish Donna a Happy Mother's Day for me.

I checked into our events on China. While I am given to understand we do not have any particular event that is engaging
those from the private sector, the Secretary is hosting a dinner tomorrow evening at State that we would welcome you
attending if that works with your schedule.

Please let me know and I will have Protocol/Lona share details and seek your information.

And thank you again for your generous moderating and support on CSIS's Haiti seminar.

Best
Cdm

Subject: SED event

Dear Cheryl,

Good Saturday morning as fair and warm weather finally come to Washington.

I was recently with our mutual friend Jose Villarreal at a Union Pacific board meeting and, as usual, Jose and I covered
the political waterfront and gave each other an update on our respective activities. During the course of our
conversation, Jose mentioned an SED event that he was not going to be able to attend. If there is a reception or part of
the SED meeting that appropriately includes members from the private sector, I would like to be appropriately
considered. Given my long commitment to U.S.-China relations and our substantial family investment in the automotive
sector (including electric vehicle development in China), my eyes and priorities have clearly move eastward. And, of
course with our older son Mark's living and working there leading our automotive endeavor, I'm fully committed.

Thank you as always for your consideration of these types of matters. I'll await your response and guidance.

Respectfully,
Mack
