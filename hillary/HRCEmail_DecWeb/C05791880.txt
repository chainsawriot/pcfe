At approximately 0900 this morning, OPAD was notified of a shooting of two of their employees. Info as I
have so far: two COM employees and a Mexican Marine counterpart were driving on a dirt road this morning to
a shooting range in the Cuernavaca area, when they came across a five vehicle convoy with armed men. The
vehicle with the employees reacted by going across a field and the armed gunmen shot at the vehicle with long
guns. The vehicle reportedly took over 200 rounds and the armoring eventually broke down and the two COM
personnel were wounded. One received two gunshot wounds in the leg and the other took a round to the
stomach and arm. The Mexican Marine was not injured. The two employees are now at the hospital in
Cuernavaca and reportedly in stable condition. RSO Mexico City personnel and OPAD personnel are in route
to the hospital. Cuernavaca is approximately 100 kilometers south of Mexico City. Mexican Marines are
providing security at the hospital. Wounded personnel may be transported to Mexico City. Apparently the
hospital in Cuernavaca does not have CT scan ability. Federal Police helicopter will be transporting OPAD,
RSO, and Med personnel to Cuernavaca from Mexico City shortly. More to follow.
