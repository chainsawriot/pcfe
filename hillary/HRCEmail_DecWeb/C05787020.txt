Hi Jake:

There are three important issues, I wanted to flag for you and, if possible, the Secretary, prior to your arrival here:

1) The civilian-nuclear problems looming: see the non-paper below (and attached), which has been cleared throughout
Washington (DOE, etc).




2) Boeing 787 "Dreamliner" sale of 27 aircraft to Air India (Al). This is a $5 billion dollar sale: Al is the second
international airline (after ANA of Japan) to receive the much-delayed planes, which were here this past week on a demo
display. Al is essentially bankrupt, so the operative political and financial question for the GOI is whether it will bail out
Al and whether any bailout will be sufficient to cover the 787 sale.

3) New consulates/visas/taxes/additional staff positions, etc: We have a long list of contentious issues between us and
the Indians, many of which have been pending for years. I have proposed to Menon and Rao that we (here in Delhi)
discuss/negotiate an overall agreement where we review together the "asks" on both sides, and reach a universal
resolution, if that is possible. Right now we are in a rigid reciprocity mode and are stuck. I would like to spend my
limited tenure here trying to get us out of this rut



We're looking forward to the visit enormously and, despite all the last minute alarums which are flying around in cyber
space, am sure it will go well.

See you soon, Peter
