I hope you have heard by now that all our noms were confirmed last night.

It will take some time for Carol and me to close up shop and move, but I wanted to say as soon as possible how great it
has been to work with you these past four years. You always made me feel part of a very tight group, and that my
contributions were appreciated. To work for HRC and with you has been remarkable; I will miss it even as I leave to a
different and exciting challenge.

Warmly,

Joe
