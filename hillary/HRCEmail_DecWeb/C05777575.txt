Fyi -- anything we can do to confirm a meeting for the Bahraini King              would be great. He's seeking week of          B5
June 8. But if not then, then another confirmed date. With All Abdullah Saleh and Qatari Amir coming, it would be good to
have this locked in.

I know we sound like a broken record, but am passing a very special request from                                             1.4(B)
from my meeting with him today. The Bahrainis would very much like to secure a meeting                                       B1 B5
for the King the week of June 8, when the King is coming to Washington to attend the araduation of
his son Nasser from the Marine Staff & Command College in Quantico.

                                                                                     If that
week cannot be accommodated, we really need to provide the Bahrainis with firm alternate
dates.

Shaikh Khaled is still looking at the week of March 28 for his own visit to DC. Can we confirm the
Secretary's availability? The FM will also seek meetings on the Hill.

Will report the substance of the meeting on the other system but quick summary:

                                                                                                                            1.4(B)
                                                                                                                            1.4(D)
                                                                                                                            B1
