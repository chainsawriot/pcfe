I sent lanny a draft of diplomacy chapter to see how Doi is likely to respond to inter-agency piece. I thought you would
like his response. Tim Rieser was also surprisingly complimentary on Friday â€” saying that he had seen many of these
exercises but that this was the most thorough and thoughtful of them all.

"Thank you so much for sending me this; I am deeply grateful, and honored, to have the opportunity to comment. Let
me begin by saying that, even apart from DOJ's interests in the QDDR, I think that this is a very impressive document; it
is beautifully written, and compellingly argued."
