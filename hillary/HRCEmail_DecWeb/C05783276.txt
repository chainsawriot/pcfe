I have learned that the Arab League will introduce UNGA resolution on Monday making Pal an observer state. The PA is
not driving this, an Arab initiative despite parallel effort in UNSC. They expect some Euro votes (ie Norway and the solid
pro-Pal. EU). Don't seem very interested in negotiating to get more. They seek a vote next week.
