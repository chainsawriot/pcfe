From Hammer:

initial stories are solid but we'll have to see how the commentary goes -- suspect we'll hear from the expected corners
(see the Jennifer Rubin piece already in WaPo) about this ensuring America's decline by weakening defense +
undercutting the military at a critical time give the Iranian threat, NK uncertainty, Afghanistan fragility, Pakistan morass,
+ Iraq unfinished business. Yet, the President has been clear from the outset that this was the direction he wanted to go
to reduce the drain on our economy from the extended wars and military deployments. And, so far, the Administration
has demonstrated that you can protect the nation and advance our national security by using our technology and
getting others to do/cooperate more, i.e, our piece -- effective diplomacy. Bottom line, this roll-out sharpens the
rhetorical debate. And we'll see more on leadership and everyone's favorite: leading from behind...

Toria (giant skeptic) believes that the first-day stories are excellent. I think they are very solid.



Toria's caveat is that we put a lot of stuff out today that we'll be hearing about all year.

But the rollout itself was effectively orchestrated.
