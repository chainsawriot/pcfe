Subject: Haiti police detain deputy they say fled jail (AP)



PORT-AU-PRINCE - (AP) Haitian police have detained a lawmaker whose name surfaced on a list of
inmates who fled Haiti's main prison the day of last year's earthquake.
  Police spokesman Gary Desrosiers says officers at Haiti's international airport took Dep. Amel Belizaire in
for questioning Thursday evening after his flight from France landed.
   Police were following a prosecutor's order to find the 4,200 inmates who escaped the National Penitentiary in
the Jan. 12 earthquake.
   Before his escape, Belizaire was arrested in 2004 on an illegal weapons charge. He was elected to the
legislature in a March 20 runoff.
   It's rare for police to detain or arrest lawmakers because their positions typically give them immunity.
