Subject                           Few items



1. Binyam Mohamed. Report from London is that Miliband's statement at 12:30 to House of Commons and his
responses to questions from members about impact on intel relationship were sober and sensible, with no glossing over
of the problem. He said there will be a "stock taking" (by us) and that they will be working with us in coming weeks to
analyze, discuss, attempt to minimize the effects, etc. Said they need to work to ensure no adverse effects. He noted
our grave concerns. He noted his conversation yesterday with you but did not characterize its content.




2. TFTP. Still some last minute wrangling in the European Parliament, but we believe the postponement is on track.
Will keep you posted.

3. Tony Blair statement. Did you receive Mitchell's proposed version? Does that work for you?

4. OAS. Did you see the WaPo editorial on Insulza? I couldn't help myself and reached out to Tom for his views on how
to proceed. Will keep you posted on that
