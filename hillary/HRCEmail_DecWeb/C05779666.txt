I agree on Holbrooke speech w more references to him.

Better to get econ speech right than soon. I had hoped we could use upcoming IMF/WB meetings to frame it but that
would require doing it this week or following Monday which would be hard.

Can you send me POTUS mtg notes today since mtg is set for tomorrow?

Are you for Butler or Conn?

First, we're trying to figure out a topic for your Holbrooke speech in Berlin. What do you think about doing a reprise, in
Europe, of your Asia Society speech on AfPak? Driving the same message again to a different audience makes some
sense to me.

Second, we are still working hard on your economic statecraft speech. We can have it ready next week - the week of the
11th - if you'd like, or the following week. It's a tough nut but we're getting there.

Third, would like to discuss Iran when I'm back. We're working on a short secprez for you for this week.
