                                    Congressional LGBT Equality Briefing:
                             The State Department and International LGBT Rights
                                          Wednesday, August 3, 2011
                                             4:30 p.m. — 6:00 p.m.

Dear Colleague,

On behalf of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, we would like to invite your staff to attend an
upcoming briefing highlighting the State Department's efforts to protect LGBT rights around the world.
Representatives of the State Department will discuss efforts to promote LGBT rights worldwide with a
discussion of bilateral, multilateral and programming efforts.

Speakers:
   • Dan Baer, Deputy Assistant Secretary, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor
   • Suzanne Nossel, Deputy Assistant Secretary, Bureau of Internatibnal Organizations
   • Elizabeth Drew, Special Assistant, Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration
   • Mira Patel, Secretary's Office of Policy Planning
   • Mark Bromley, Council Chair, Council for Global Equality

The State Department has been an instrumental player in advancing the rights of LGBT people around the
world. Specifically, in Honduras in 2009 and 2010, anti-gay violence increased significantly, and more than 30
LGBT people were murdered with investigations going nowhere. The United States Embassy publicly called
on the Honduran government to bring the perpetrators to justice and protect all Hondurans from future harm.
Shortly after, the Honduran government created a taskforce to investigate and prevent hate crimes. The United
States Embassy stayed involved and arranged for a U.S. prosecutor and detective to be available to assist in
Honduras' effort.

In 2010, Slovakia held its first-ever Pride parade, and sadly the event ended in violence. This year the U.S.
Embassy staff worked to make the event a success. The U.S. Embassy brought together more than 20 chiefs of
mission from other nations to sign a public statement of support for the march and participate in a respectful,
productive debate on LGBT rights.

These are just a few examples of the State Department's ground-breaking efforts. They have sent a consistent
message throughout the world that "all people's rights and dignity must be protected whatever their sexual
orientation or gender identity."

That message has paid off.

On Friday, June 17, 2011, the Human Rights Council passed the first ever UN resolution recognizing the human
rights of LGBT people worldwide. The resolution condemns acts of violence and discrimination committed
against individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity. The resolution is a bold first step
and calls for a global study on human rights violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity that will
provide guidance for how to fight these violations and protect LGBT rights around the world.
