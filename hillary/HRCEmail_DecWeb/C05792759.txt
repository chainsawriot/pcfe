Subject: FW: OIG inspection of Embassy Nairobi and Somalia Unit


The "Inspection of Embassy Nairobi, Kenya (Report Number ISP-I-12-38A, August 2012)" will be put up on the OIG
web site some time Friday morning, WDC time

Included in the Embassy Nairobi report are the following key findings [Edited by PK to list only those relevant to Amb.]:

      •   The Ambassador has lost the respect and confidence of the staff to lead the mission. Of more than 80 chiefs of
          mission inspected in recent cycles, the Ambassador ranked last for interpersonal relations!, next to last on both
          managerial skill and attention to morale, and third from last in his overall scores from surveys of mission
          members. The inspectors found no reason to question these assessments; the Ambassador's leadership to date
          has been divisive and ineffeah7e.


      •   _ Ambassador has damaged the cohesion of Embassy Nairobi's country team by underscoring diffeiences
          The
          between offices working directly with Kenya and those with regional responsibilities. Country team members,
          particularly those from other agencies, relied on the recently departed deputy chief of mission to maintain a
          sense of common purpose at Embassy Nairobi. Unless corrected there is a risk that the country team will
          become dysfunctional. The Ambassador needs to broaden his understanding of why various agencies are part of
          his mission, cease avoiding contact with them, and work with the assistance of a senior Department of State
          (Department) official and the next deputy chief of mission to restore country team harmony.


      •   The Ambassador's efforts to develop and focus the mission's work around what he calls "mission essential tasks"
          have consumed considerable staff time and produced documents of unclear status and almost no value to the!
          Department in approving priorities and assigning resources. His efforts have also created confusion about the
          relevance of the embassy's annual Mission Resource Request (MRR). The Office of Inspector General (01G) team
          agreed with embassy staff that the mission essential task process added no real value to the management of the
          embassy.

      •   The Ambassador's greatest weakness is his reluctance to accept clear-cut U.S. Government decisions. He made
          clear his disagreement with Washington policy decisions and directives concerning the safe-havening in Nairobi
          of families of Department employees who volunteered to serve in extreme hardship posts; the creation of a
          freestanding Somalia Unit; and the nonuse of commercial email for official government business, including
          Sensitive But Unclassified information. Notwithstanding his talk about the importance of mission staff doing the
          right thing, the Ambassador by deed or word has encouraged it to do the opposite.

          The Ambassador does not read classified front channel messages and has not established a system to. have his
          staff screen incoming cables relevant to Kenya and U.S. interests in the region.

•   The
      —Ambassador's initiative to redirect programming for nearly S-550 million in U.S. health assistance, while weli
    intentioned, has proven disruptive and created confusion about its relationship to existing programs. He
    announced to the Kenyans the establishment of a new unfunded program, called Let's Live, with the unrealistic
    aim of reducing by 50 percent in 1 year Kenya's premature mortality rates for infants, mothers, and non-
    communicable diseases.

       The 'embassy needs to focus the political section's reporting on the forthcoming March 2013 election and
       should draw from a 1-year strategy recently approved by Washington, which includes a plan to engage the
       Kenyan public and authorities to prevent and mitigate ethnic-political conflict.

   •   The respective responsibilities of Embassy Nairobi and the Somalia Unit are clear in principle, but in practice the
       Ambassador has set a tone that discourages collaboration between the embassy and the Somalia Unit.

       Embassy Nairobi's rp—ublic diplomacy efforts would be strengthened if there were better internal communicatiori
       and coordination among agencies to publicize U.S. assistance efforts in Kenyi. The Ambassador should be a
       more integral part of the mission's public affairs strategy and activities.
