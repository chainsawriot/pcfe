Cheryl:

Looks like I am finally moving through the bureaucracy. I leave here on Feb 29 with a short stop in Louisiana for
                                   and will be in DC in the office on March 6. Again, I would like to thank the
Secretary and you for the confidence you have in me. I look forward to rolling up my sleeves and getting started. I will
contact your office when I arrive to get some early guidance and share some ideas. Best, Linda
