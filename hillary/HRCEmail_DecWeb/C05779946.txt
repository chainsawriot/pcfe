Subject: Molho and the Q

Molho informed me this morning that he could not attend the Quartet meeting on March 2 in Brussels, but could meet
at a later date. He cited a conflict requiring his presence in Israel to advise the PM, a desire to consult me in advance,
and lingering anger over Serry's public reference Friday to the meeting.

After consulting the Senator, I informed Molho that, in seeking delay, we would like to provide the Quartet with an
Israeli commitment to meet the following week. He said that was reasonable but wanted to check with the PM. In a later
conversation, he said he still thought it would be ok, but said the PM wanted to consult the FM, and he (Molho) would
get back to me in the morning.

After hearing from Molho tomorrow, I plan to convene an envoys call to propose we delay both the Israeli and
Palestinian meetings one week, and hold them in Jerusalem/Ramallah. I expect the others will push to proceed as
planned with the Palestinians, and then meet later with Molho. So long as we can point to a confirmed Israeli meeting,
I'm not sure it matters much either way, but overall more delay, the better.

I don't want to speculate on the Israeli motivation on this system.

If we postpone both meetings one week, I would go out in advance to see Molho. If the Q insists on seeing Erekat this
Wednesday, I would go to that, continue my planned consultations Thursday and Friday with the French and British, and
end up in Jerusalem on Sunday.
