Sir,


I spoke by phone today with former Congressman Curt Weldon. He shared the following:

- Ahmed Qadhafadam's nephew, Walid Qadhafadam, is a good contact of his.

- Saadi al-Qadhafi, whom CW met on previous trips to LY, reached out through Republican operative/lobbyist Stephen
Payne to encourage CW to visit LY, assuring him he'd see Q and that the latter would be willing to discuss his possible
departure from power with him.

- CW insisted on a letter of invitation from Q's COS, Bashir Saleh, who had facilitated CW's previous trips to LY and CW-Q
meetings. CW received such a letter in English and Arabic and subsequently spoke by phone with Bashir, who strongly
urged him to travel to LY to meet with Q.

- Bashir stressed that CW's multiple meetings with Q and efforts to promote Congress-GPC ties gave him unique
credibility with the Leader. Bashir opined that he believed Q would be willing to discuss "all possibilities" with CW.

- CW, Stephen Payne and Brian Ettinger (VP Biden's Leg Affairs Director from his Senate days) depart for. Paris this
evening, then fly to Tunisia (believe it's Djerba) on Monday. They will drive overland to Tripoli Monday night and expect
to meet with Q on Tuesday or Wednesday. CW does not plan to spend more than two nights in LY.

- CW said Ettinger had conveyed the trip info               and that Esther Coopersmith (close friend of Secretary
Clinton and father of CW business partner Ron Coopersmith) had conveyed it to a "very senior Secretary Clinton staffer"
(NFI).

- CW said he intends to tell Q it's over and that he must leave for the good of the country and his family. CW made it
clear to Bashir he is going as a private U.S. citizen, not/not a USG rep.

- CW said his intention was to be very direct with Q and try to scare him by making him realize the longer the crisis wears
on, the more likely it is that he and his family will be killed and the country ruined. Said he would tell Q that even
though no one could promise him protection from ICC prosecution, he still should leave as part of a negotiated
settlement.

- I urged him to convey two further points: 1) Saif and other Qadhafi family members would have to leave, too, and
could not be part of a transitional gov't; and 2) Q's regime must immediately stop killing civilians (referenced Jebel
Nafusa reports). CW agreed with both.

He asked two things of me:

1) That I ask whether Secretary Clinton wanted him to convey an oral or written private message to Q. Told him I didn't
know that there would be interest - pls advise soonest if there is.

2) That we check to see if he might egress from Tripoli by sea to Malta (he's already arranged a boat). U.S. Ambassador
to Valletta Miceli is a friend of CW's and wants CW to brief the Maltese PM. Unless you object, I'll check with AFRICOM
to see if this is even possible.

Best regards,

John
