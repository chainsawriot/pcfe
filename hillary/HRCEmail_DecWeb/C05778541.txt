  Egyptian PM: "Fatal error" behind 02 Feb violence in Tahrir Sq
  In a telephone interview with the Egyptian state-owned Channel One TV on
  3 February at 0903 gmt, the newly appointed Prime Minister Ahmad Shafik
  described the violent events of 02 February and the violence that took
  place in Tahrir square as "fatal" error. He promised to "hold an
  investigation" into the recent collapse in security and to include the Tahrir
  square protesters in his talks with the opposition.

   The PM's view on what took place in Tahrir Sq

  The prime minister began by explaining his view of what happened on
  Wednesday.

  Shafik said: "Yesterday afternoon some groups rushed (into the square),
  they were not expected to behave in such a manner and they are not
  identifiable until now. They entered the area of Tahrir Square and there
  were frictions between the two sides. This friction developed and escalated
  the matters further. There were losses and casualties. This is a situation, in
  reality all Egyptians are losers and so is Egypt. This is a waste of
  resources, and extremism. This is a very dangerous sight, for anyone who
  loves this state or is loyal to Egypt."

  "I repeat and confirm that this issue will not pass unnoticed" the prime
  minister promised. He asked: "Who entered here? Who planned for this?
  And if no one planed for this, what directed them to this area? This group
  that came near the end with some camels, a comical scene but it escalated
  rapidly."

  Shafik added: "Of course, with the youth and their pouring enthusiasm, it
  went into the night. The casualties rose. The government was present here
  represented by the minister of health. He was present inside, for a period
  of two or three hours, with his ambulances and serving the two sides. He
  was serving here and there and the injuries were here and there. They
  were treated in the field or by transferring to hospital."

   A fatal error

  "First and foremost there was a fatal error that happened last night. It was
  unforeseen, that it would turn up like this" the Egyptian prime minister
  said. He then promised that his cabinet will investigate the recent events.

 He said he was ordered "presidential delegation" to investigate the "causes
 of the security collapse that happened in the past phase".

 "This whole issue, including what happened yesterday, will be under
 investigation by the specified authorities. So that the honourable crowds,
 know where the mistake was, and who was behind it? Was it intentional or
 one error resulting from negligence and ineptitude? All this must be
 clarified," added Sahfik.

  Talks with the opposition and anti-Mubarak protesters

 Shafik apologized "for everything that happened yesterday. Honestly this is
 illogical and irrational." He went on to say that he will "begin dialogue
 today." He said: "We will sit as is planned with the honourable group and
 its varied opinions, that sees that it has an opposing view or do not agree
 100 percent with the view expressed in the President's decisions. Hopefully
 we will find some common grounds."

 He said this "group was selected by all opposing entities" including the
 protesters in Tahrir square.
