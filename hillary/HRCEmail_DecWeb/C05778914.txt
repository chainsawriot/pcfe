Denis

Just an update:

I did not receive a call from Tim.

CA has reached the next of kin for both of the married couple travelers.

No one is answering any of the numbers CA has for the third traveler so they will be reaching out to fbi to see if any
other numbers for that individual.

CA still reaching out to fourth traveler.
