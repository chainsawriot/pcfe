Cheryl,
                                                                                                                B6




         I plan to be in DC on March 20 and 21. I would love to meet with you if you have a few minutes. I
am on the WAE roster and believe that I might be of use to you as summer approaches and there are gaps in the
leadership of our embassies.

          Congratulations on the amazing job that you and the Secretary are doing.

          Warmly, Vicki
