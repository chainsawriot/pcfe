Cheryl,


        The ExecSec document (draft copy attached) is at DoD and I gave Nora a POC there for Congresswoman
Richardson to call (Jim Shear, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Partnership Strategy and Humanitarian
Operations).


          That said, they understand the high level of interest in this matter, including from Congress, and plan to press
for a quick decision (this will likely go to the SecDef). We will likely not hear anything more until tomorrow morning, but
I wanted you to know that at least at the working level, there is some resistance. Dan
