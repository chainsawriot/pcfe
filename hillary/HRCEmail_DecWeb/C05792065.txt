Subject: BIDEN FOREIGN-POLICY SPEECH AT NYU ON THU

--BIDEN FOREIGN-POLICY SPEECH AT NYU ON THU .: "[T]he Vice President will describe how, under President Obama's
leadership, we have successfully confronted our enemies and strengthened our alliances to effectively meet the
challenges we face overseas. The Vice President will contrast the Administration's record with the empty rhetoric of
Governor Mitt Romney, who continues to distort and mischaracterize the President's accomplishments on foreign policy
and national security without offering policy alternatives of his own.... The event is the fifth in a series of remarks that
the Vice President has delivered across the country on issues that will be at the core of the general election."
