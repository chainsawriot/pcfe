I have so many things to write to you on Mother's Day -- but the below is incredible. I wrote to Cheryl how incredibly
proud I was to see you in that picture, and how depressing it still is that you are one of only 2 women (and the other
barely visible). But as always, you are blazing trails ... just got back my framed version of the picture you signed for me; I
got it framed with the same frame as the picture I gave you and it will hang in pride of place in my office. I will make sure
this Der Zeitung piece is all over Twitter at least.

Also wanted to make sure you saw the following from the Jonathan Alter profile in Vanity Fair.

"A myth quickly arose that the women in the administration-Clinton, U.N. ambassador Susan Rice, and national-security
aide Samantha Power, whose Pulitzer Prize-winning book on genocide was influential in Obama's thinking-drove the
debate. "The idea that the girls pushed the boys into war is ludicrous," says Anne-Marie Slaughter, who until recently
served as director of policy planning at State. "We were dismissed for months as soft liberals concerned about
'peripheral' development issues like women and girls, and now we're Amazonian Valkyrie warmongers. Please." In truth,
the president, as usual, was not persuaded by anyone to change his mind. He was always a reluctant warrior and
decided to intervene only when imminent atrocities in Benghazi made sitting on his hands even riskier."

I have never been happier back at home with my sons -- on this mother's day, let us all commit to make life better for
mothers all over the world.
All best,
AM

The Jerusalem Post reported today that a NY Hasidic paper Der Zeitung published the sit room photo w/o me (or Audrey
T) photoshopped out perhaps because no woman should be in such a place of power or that I am dressed immodestly!!.
