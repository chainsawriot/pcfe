Subject:                           DoS/BBG



Just met with Walter Isaacson to discuss next steps in terms of developing a comprehensive strategy for addressing the
issues you raised at yesterday's meeting. We are putting together a small team from State and BBG to provide market
analysis and help guide a strategic planning process. We agreed to put this on a fast track so that we can come back to
you with recommendations within a matter of weeks.


The BBG is already considering some structural changes which should bring BBG into the 21st century and help us
achieve the larger goal of raising the voice of the USG. Walter and I both agree that the organization as presently
configured is largely dysfunctional. Among the things under consideration is the consolidation of the entities into one
operating unit and the appointment of a CEO to oversee all broadcast activities. Also looking at the possibility of creating
a global newsroom. Unclear at this point if any of this will require Congressional approval.


Will keep you posted as things move forward.
