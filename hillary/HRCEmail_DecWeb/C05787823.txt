Subject: Branding

I am working on a paper for you on branding but thought I would give you a preview of my thinking while the formal
recommendation works its way through the clearance process.

As you know the issue of branding continues to be a major challenge. Despite the fact that the USG spends billions of
dollars each year administering a broad array of programs and initiatives, there is little recognition among foreign
publics of the extent of our investments and assistance. There are literally hundreds of different logos and branding
treatments across government departments and agencies with little or no reference to the United States. In many
cases, specific branding requirements in contracts with our implementing partners are either waived or ignored. While
it is relatively easy to identify the problem, finding a solution is difficult even within our own Department. There are
probably a number of reasons for this --- everything from " institutional egos" to the need to focus on more
immediate priorities. Yet each day that passes without a resolution of this matter is a day we lose to promote our
national interests.




I hope to have the paper to you for your consideration by the end of next week. In the meantime I'd be happy to answer
any questions.
