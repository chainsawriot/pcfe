Assume you know "Dushanbe" means "Monday" in Persian, cuz that was (and may still be) the market day. So if you're
giving a speech, you can't say, "If it's Friday, this must be Dushanbe." But you can say absolutely anything else you want,
Madam Secretary. Cheers. S.

Great on getting Mike for FAPB. Dashing through O'Hare connecting homeward from Hong Kong, which reverberates
with good buzz on your speech there and where I had a lovely dim sum lunch with             Cheers. Strobe
