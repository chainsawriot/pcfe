Maria--

You've done a great job pulling this together, and I agree it should be housed at State. I look forward to your proposal as
to how we should do that.

And, pls let me know as soon as possible when the event at UNGA will be held so I can get it on my schedule.

Hope you have a good weekend too---H

Subject: Open Government Initiative

Hillary:
This is a quick update on the high-level meeting of the Open Government Partnership (OGP) we are hosting at State on
Tuesday July 12. I've been working closely with the White House in anticipation of your announcement with Brazilian
Foreign Minister Patriota of this multilateral initiative. We will have 55+ countries represented at the Tuesday meeting,
including 20+ minister-level officials. We will also be joined by 60+ leading civil society representatives from around the
world. The day of meetings will include presentations by more than 15 governments on their own domestic efforts in
combating corruption, enhancing transparency, and increasing civic participation in 21st century governance. It will also
focus on the use of technology for pursuing open government. The full agenda is in your briefing papers.

Thank you again for agreeing to open and close this important event. I am grateful to U/S Kennedy for his help in pulling
this off with such short notice. It will lay the foundation for the follow-on OGP meeting on the sidelines of this year's UN
General Assembly - we're close to confirming the President's participation.

Countries have expressed a surprisingly high level of enthusiasm for this new initiative. After the July 12 meeting, I
want to find a way to house "open government" at State as a compliment to ongoing domestic work; it should grow its
legs here as part of the work we are already doing on government transparency and engaging civil society. I
will develop a proposal for your consideration.
Enjoy the weekend!

Best,
Maria
