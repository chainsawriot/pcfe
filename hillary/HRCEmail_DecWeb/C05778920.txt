MS -

You might already know about this, but Helene Cooper and Mark Landler are working on a story about how POTUS was
more forward leaning on Egypt than you/State. Story is that State is dodgy and bureaucratic while the President is
fundamentally an idealist. Jake,                               and ! have gone at both Helene and Mark as a group and
individually several times over the last several hours, but I'm afraid we haven't been able to knock them off their thesis.
At the moment it's slated to run on Sunday. We are in very close contact                 about knocking it down before it
runs, and how to handle after it does.
