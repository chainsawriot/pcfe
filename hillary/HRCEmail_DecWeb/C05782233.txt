Call Sheet for FAPB Proposed Members
Purpose of Call: We are proposing twenty-five individuals for membership to the Foreign Affairs Policy Board. You
should call the following nine to extend your personal invitation to serve on the board for a period of two years.




•     We have created a new federal advisory committee at the State Department to provide me with informed advice
on a broad range of U.S. foreign policy issues. The committee will be comprised of approximately twenty-five private
American citizens who have distinguished backgrounds in U.S. diplomacy, development and national security
affairs. The membership will be bi-partisan and diverse. We have named this committee the Foreign Affairs Policy
Board.

•     Would you be willing to serve on this board for a two-year term?.      I plan to hold three board meetings per year
at the State Department. We will try to have the first one this fall.

•   All members will be appointed as Special Government Employees (SGEs). As such, they will be required to
complete Confidential Financial Disclosure Reports before their first board meeting.

•    The board meetings will be classified. All members will maintain State Department security clearances for the
duration of their terms.

•   As a member of this board, you will not receive a salary, but will be reimbursed for travel, lodging and per diem
expenses incurred to attend the meetings in Washington, DC.

•   If you would like to take a few days to consider this invitation, I will ask a member of my staff to contact you (in
about a week).
