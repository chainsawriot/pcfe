Hannah Rosenthal to Serve as Milwaukee
Jewish Federation CEO/President
Milwaukee — Hannah Rosenthal, the United States Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism, has
accepted a position as the new Chief Executive Officer/President of the Milwaukee Jewish Federation
according to MJF Board Chair Jerry Benjamin.

The selection of Rosenthal was officially approved by the MJF Executive Committee on July 18.
"We are very excited to bring a nationally recognized leader like Hannah Rosenthal to Milwaukee," said
Dan Bader, Chairperson of the Milwaukee Jewish Federation's CEO Search Committee. "Hannah

Rosenthal is the right person to lead the Federation into the future following the past year of community
input and reimagining. She has a strong background as a transformational leader and an amazing grasp
of organizational change."

Rosenthal has strong Wisconsin roots, having graduated from the University of Wisconsin — Madison
after starting her undergraduate studies at Mt. Holyoke College in South Hadley Massachusetts. After
graduating from UW, she attended rabbinical school in Jerusalem and Los Angeles. She returned to
Wisconsin as the religious education director at Madison's Temple Beth El and later became involved in
political and civic affairs in Wisconsin. Following a stint as Midwest Regional Director, U.S. Department
of Health & Human Services, Rosenthal served at Executive Director of the American Jewish Council for
Public Affairs, 2000-2005. This was followed by roles as Executive Director of the Chicago Foundation
for Women (2005-2009) and Corporate Vice President, Wisconsin Physicians Services, 2008-2009.

In 2009, Rosenthal was tapped for her current role as Special Envoy in the State Department. In this
role, she reports on the status of anti-Semitism and other hatreds throughout the world to determine how
to address anti-Semitism and other human rights abuses in U.S. foreign policy. She regularly briefs the
President, the Secretary of State and Congress on worldwide trends in these areas and creates
strategies to combat hatreds.

"I am thrilled to accept this position," said Hannah Rosenthal. "I am so impressed with the vision the
community has set for the future of the Milwaukee Jewish Federation and believe we have the
opportunity to become the model for Federations across the nation in engaging the Jewish community."

Reimagining Process
Over the last 15 months, the Milwaukee Jewish Federation has engaged in a process of transformational
change based on a deep and broad dialogue with the community. As part of that process, the Federation
created a vision to refocus its mission around two areas: (1) Financial Resource Development; and (2)
Outreach, Engagement and Leadership Development.

To help the organization achieve its new vision, the Milwaukee Jewish Federation recognized the need to
engage a leader with deep experience in each of these areas. The Federation created a CEO Search
Committee to conduct a rigorous national search for the right candidate. The committee was led by
community volunteer Dan Bader and included diverse representation of Milwaukee's Jewish community:
Jerry Benjamin, Alan Borsuk, Mark Brickman, Fred Croen, Mark Goldstein, Bonnie Jacobson, Rabbi Wes
Kalmar, Marlene Lauwasser, David Lubar and Andrea Schneider. The Committee worked closely with
the staff of the Jewish Federations of North America Mandel Center for Leadership Excellence.

"Hannah is a truly exceptional individual, with a deep commitment to Jewish causes," added Jerry
Benjamin, Chairperson of the Federation's Board of Directors. "I look forward to introducing her to the
Board and the community, and to partnering with her in the work ahead as the Federation continues to
evolve through the reimagining and transition processes. Hannah understands fundraising and
community building and will be an enormous asset to our community as we continue to emphasize
financial resource development and community outreach in our efforts going forward."

Rosenthal is expected to begin her new role in October 2012. Sheryl Primakow will continue as Interim
Executive Director of the Milwaukee Jewish Federation until that time and then will move into a new
position as Chief Operating Officer. In August 2012, Jerry Benjamin will step down as Board Chair, and
Board Chair Elect Marlene Lauwasser is expected to be elected to that position.

MILWAUKEE JEWISH FEDERATION
Through the development of community-wide financial support, planning and allocations, the mission of
the Milwaukee Jewish Federation is to ensure the continuity of the Jewish people, to enhance the quality
of Jewish life, and to build a strong and unified Jewish community in Milwaukee, in Israel and throughout
the world. Over this past year, our highest priority has been the ongoing Reimagining and Transition of
our community and our Federation. This process has informed our plans for the future, leading us to
discover new ways of raising funds, planning, communicating and building community.
