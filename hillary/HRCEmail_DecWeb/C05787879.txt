I could do both so I will call you at 9:20 and then leave open some time around 11:30 in case you want to come by too.

Thanks Hillary. It would be great to catch up. I could speak by phone before meeting at WH. Say around 9 20. Or could
pop in to State after say 11 30 am for quick chat. Whichever good for you. Best Tony

Dear Tony,

I'd love to see or talk to you today. I know you're seeing the President at 10; we could talk before then, and/or get
together afterwards. Just let me know what works for you. Thanks for all you're trying to do. H
