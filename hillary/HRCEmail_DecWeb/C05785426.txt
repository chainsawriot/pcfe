Ideally we're able to line up a short Oval mtg before August. NZ elections will be in late November and Kiwis have told us
he will need to cut back on intl travel starting mid-summer. I'm sure there is some wiggle room though not sure how
much. September and most of October taken up by NZ hosting of the Rugby World Cup.

Above considerations aside, as long as we can provide a window with decent advance notice we're confident we can
make this work.
