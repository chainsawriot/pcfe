Will send longer note to S tomorrow on talks in Baku, Tbilisi and Yerevan, but quick word on      first.                             B6

Tough one on one with Aliyev. He appreciated S call,




                                   Look forward to talking when I'm back on Fri.                                                 1.4(B)

Pat: Don't think there are any ways to "extend" temporarily beyond end of year, but pls let me know if Harold or Miguel have any B1
ideas.

Thanks. Bill
