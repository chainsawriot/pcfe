FYI — going now:

                                                  November 27, 2010



Via Electronic Mail
Ms. Jennifer Robinson
Attorney for Mr. Julian Assange
Wikileaks
179 Great Portland Street
London WIW 5LS

Dear Ms. Robinson and Mr. Assange:

I am writing in response to your 26 November 2010 letter to U.S. Ambassador Louis B. Sussman regarding your intention
to again publish on your WikiLeaks site reportedly up to 250,000 classified U.S. Government documents which are not
authorized for release.

As you know, if the materials you intend to publish were provided by any government officials, or any intermediary
without proper authorization, they were provided in violation of U.S. law and without regard for the grave
consequences of this action. As long as WikiLeaks holds this material, the violation of the law is ongoing.

It is our understanding from conversations with representatives from The New York Times, The Guardian and Der
Speigel, that WikiLeaks also has provided approximately 250,000 documents to them for publication, furthering the
illegal dissemination of classified documents.

Publication of documents of this nature at a minimum would:

    •   Place at risk the lives of countless innocent individuals — from journalists to human rights activists and
        bloggers to soldiers to individuals providing information to further peace and security;

    •   Place at risk on-going military operations, including operations to stop terrorists, traffickers in human
        beings and illicit arms, violent criminal enterprises and other actors that threaten global security; and,

    •   Place at risk on-going cooperation between countries — partners, allies and common stakeholders — to
        confront common challenges from terrorism to pandemic diseases to nuclear proliferation that threaten
        global stability.

In your letter, you say you want — consistent with your goal of "maximum disclosure" — information regarding individuals
who may be "at significant risk of harm" because of your actions.

Despite your stated desire to protect those lives, you have done the opposite and endangered the lives of
countless individuals. You have undermined your stated objective by disseminating this material widely.,
without redaction and without regard to the security and sanctity of the lives your actions endanger. We will
not engage in a negotiation regarding the further release or dissemination of illegally obtained U.S. Government
classified materials. If you are genuinely interested in seeking to stop the damage from your actions, you
should: 1) ensure WikiLeaks ceases publishing any and all such materials; 2) ensure WikiLeaks returns any and
all classified U.S. Government material in its possession; and 3) remove and destroy all records of this material
from WikiLeaks' databases.

                                                               Sincerely,




                                                                Harold Hongju Koh
                                                                Legal Adviser
                                                                U.S. Department of State




From: Mills, Cheryl D                                       B3 NATSECACT1947
