I defer to Beth or Tim on this, as they're the ones who have had the convos with the Paks today, but Sherry went out of
her way yesterday to say repeatedly how much Z cherishes S and looked forward to seeing her, etc.

                                       The reason the DCM gave is they'd prefer to keep this a straight bilat with the
Afghans, which is also possible. But they've also cancelled Z's attendance at the Field Museum dinner tmw night b/c it
wasn't VVIP enough. So I think they're just acting out at the situation they're finding themselves in, but others may
know more or feel differently about the rationale.
