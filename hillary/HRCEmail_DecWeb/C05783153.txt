Boeing is finalizing a Memorandum of Agreement on the terms of the Boeing-Lion Air deal (to include the number of
planes, pricing, delivery dates, and deposit) to be signed by Lion Air CEO and Boeing executives at Bali on the sidelines of
the EAS. While the Memorandum is not the final contract, this will move the negotiations forward and enable the final
contract to be completed in early to mid-December.

The deal will be for 230 737-max airplanes with an option to purchase an additional 150.         is working to get the final   B6
numbers for us, but the deal will be valued at roughly $22 billion for the 230, and in the $30s with the options.

                                                                                                                               B5
