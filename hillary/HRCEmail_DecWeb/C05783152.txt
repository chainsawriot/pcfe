                                              Office of the Press Secretary
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 10, 2011

      Statement by the President on the State Department's Keystone XL Pipeline Announcement

I support the State Department's announcement today regarding the need to seek additional
information about the Keystone XL Pipeline proposal. Because this permit decision could affect the
health and safety of the American people as well as the environment, and because a number of
concerns have been raised through a public process, we should take the time to ensure that all
questions are properly addressed and all the potential impacts are properly understood. The final
decision should be guided by an open, transparent process that is informed by the best available
science and the voices of the American people. At the same time, my administration will build on the
unprecedented progress we've made towards strengthening our nation's energy security, from
responsibly expanding domestic oil and gas production to nearly doubling the fuel efficiency of our
cars and trucks, to continued progress in the development of a clean energy economy.

                                                             ###
