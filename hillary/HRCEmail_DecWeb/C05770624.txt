Jake, I know Ellen passed along that the Kissinger brief was a success. Below is a short readout.

All,

The briefing this afternoon with Dr. Kissinger went well. Were present: U/S Tauscher, General Cartwright, Jim Miller,
Phillip Niedzielski-Eichner, Mike Elliott, Rose Gottemoeller, Brian, and myself.

Brian can add more but the highlights were that Dr. Kissinger asked about heavy bombers, reductions in delivery
vehicles, missile defense and relevant language in the treaty, prompt global strike, and the relationship between New
START and previous treaties. There was prolonged discussion about the three Rs and modernization where he
acknowledged he is less familiar.

He said he had recommended ratification of New START as recently as today at a lunch at the Mayflower and would do
so again at his SFRC hearing on May 25th.

The Vice President stopped by and urged him to help make the strategic case for New START and help members
understand the need for the treaty.

Kissinger said many of his questions were answered today but that he might still have some. He did say on a couple of
occasions that he would not encourage lines of questioning into areas that were controversial.

Simon
