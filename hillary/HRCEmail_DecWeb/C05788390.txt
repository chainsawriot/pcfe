Since you are seeing Susan, sharing her last email. I then took all UN people off email and asked state team what they
thought.

Susan - do we feel confident that tues 3pm will stick? She's open to going if you all support but we have a nutty day we'd
have to take down with a foreign bilat and a speech. Not even sure people will be ok but before we start calling, want to
see how firm this is.

Tues is tough but might be possible to cancel or re-schedule her bilat and speech to make day trip to ny. Talking to her in
a few minutes and be sure she knows everyone supports.

Update on timing based on Council discussions today —

Tuesday, Jan 31, is now the earliest the Council session (including the el-Araby/HBJ briefing) could be held. Locking in
this date is conditioned on getting the AL monitoring report circulated among the Council by tomorrow. It is possible
that the session could slip further.

Any sense whether the Secretary is available Tues or Wed of next week?

Many thanks.

 I think it would be excellent to have her there. Not that Susan Rice can't and wouldn't deliver our message forcefully and
 effectively. But it would be noticed if S were there.

We think it would be very good to have her participate, including to help elevate the discussion and reinforce efforts to
move toward adopting a resolution as soon as possible.

I'll defer to Huma on the scheduling piece, but on the substance, what do you/Susan think? Also adding Wendy and Bill
and Jeff for their views.

Importance: High

 On Monday, Jan 30, the UN Security Council will be briefed by Qatari PM/FM HBJ and Arab League Secretary General el-
 Araby on Syria. This morning in NY, the Qataris asked/urged that ministers attend the meeting. France and Portugal
 said their ministers are "likely" to come. Others are possible, but uncertain at this point. Syria will also speak, though
 unclear at what level. This will be a high-profile mtg that we hope will accelerate negotiations on a Syria UNSC
 resolution.

 Amb Rice asked me to inquire whether there is any possibility that the Secretary might be able to attend.

 The format likely to be a public briefing followed by either a closed or open UNSC session (the latter is TBD at this point),
 all beginning at 3pm and likely to last —2 hours.

 I'm happy to discuss further. If possible, it would be helpful to passback an initial indication of the Secretary's
 availability early this afternoon to help NY shape the discussions.

 Rexon
