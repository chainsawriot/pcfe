Here is the latest:

                                                                                                                             B5




Sec Def is tasked with making ask calls to the UK, France, Italy, Romania, Greece, and Australia. He has called Italy and
one other (we don't know which) and is balking at some. We're trying to learn more.

RCH's latest view, per his team, is that we should be holier than the pope and do as many calls as possible.



Please let me know if you need further info.

Ok but • Is be sure I have call sheets. And I'd like to know which ones Jones has called so I'm not surprised like I was
when                old me Jones had called already to discuss and they were already considering. I also want to know if B1
Gates or anyone else has call a govt. Thx.                                                                               1.4(B)
