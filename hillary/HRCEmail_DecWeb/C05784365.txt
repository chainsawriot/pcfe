We went with short statement below from Gutman to ABC tonight; Brussels will release same at their 00B.
Press-wise this is playing on Drudge and apparently Gingrich tweeted that the President should fire him. We'll be
tracking tomorrow but also see at bottom Simon Wiesenthal Center calls on Sec of State Clinton to Rebuke US
Ambassador.

From Ambassador Howard Gutman:

"I strongly condemn anti-Semitism in all its forms. I deeply regret if my comments were taken the wrong way.
My own personal history and that of my family is testimony to the salience of this issue and my continued commitment
to combatting anti-Semitism."

Following release passed from NSS:

release December 3, 2011 Simon Wiesenthal Center calls on Sec of State Clinton to Rebuke US Ambassador blaming
Muslim hatred of Jews on Israel The Simon Wiesenthal Center urged Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to " immediately
and unequivocally disassociate herself from comments made by US Amb Howard Gutman who told a Jewish group that
"a distinction should be made between traditional anti-semitism which should be condemned and Muslim hatred of
Jews which stems from the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians".
"The Simon Wieaenthal Center calls on Secy of State Clinton to immediately rebuke Gutman for excusing Muslim hatred
of Jews"' said Rabbis Marvin Hier, Dean and Founder and Abraham Cooper, associate Dean in a statement on behalf of
its 400,000 constituent families of the leading Jewish Human Rights NGO.
  "America has always taken the lead in condemning hate in all its manifestations, not providing a moral free pass to
extremists whose hate of Jews besmirches the Muslim religion and has spawned violent hatred against Jews across the
Middle East and beyond."
" Following Gutman's twisted logic, Christian anti-semites who insist that their hatred of Jews is based on the fact that
the Jewish people failed to acknowledge Jesus as Messsiah should also be excused until such time as the underlying
reason for that hate-- the Jewish people's refusal to accept Jesus as messiah is reversed."
"As Ambassador to Belgium, a country where Jews have been attacked by Muslim extremists, Ambassador Gutman's
statement is beyond shocking; it will only serve to further embolden hate from Islamist extremists in Europe and

v anti-semitism", the Wiesenthal Center officials concluded

Phil, Tina, Kathleen, Jane:
Here is the text of Ambassador Gutman's speech on anti-Semitism in Europe, delivered Weds to a conference of
European Jewish lawyers in Brussels (European Jewish Union). As you know, a few special-interest blogs have criticized
the speech. The text was fully cleared by senior Embassy staff.
