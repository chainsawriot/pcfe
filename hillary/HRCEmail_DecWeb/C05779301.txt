Subject: FW: Special Envoy Richardson - follow up

Cheryl, Jake - spoke to Insulza on Friday about Gov Richardson's comments re:
Cuba. As expected, he said that Richardson was not speaking on behalf of the
OAS - but as a private citizen, etc.
We will be reaching out to the Hill (Ros-Lehtinen's office) to respond to their
questions. The following are the points that we will make.

Ambassador —

Pursuant to our conversation, it seems we have concurrence that we respond to the HFAC staff query (below) via
telephone call which I would be pleased to make. (H also agrees it would be best to respond with a call.) Following are
talking points for your review and approval:

    •     Secretary General Insulza's designation and announcement of Gov. Bill Richardson as a special envoy for the
          OAS was made without any consultation with or consent of the U.S. Mission to the OAS or the Department. In
          fact, we first heard of the announcement through press reports.

    •     Upon hearing the news, Ambassador Lomellin immediately raised concern with the Secretary General and
          expressed our displeasure, as he should have consulted with the USG before making this appointment. We
          specifically expressed concern that the Governor's views might be misconstrued as representing official U.S.
          policy, and in particular on the very sensitive issue of U.S.-Cuba policy. Insulza committed that it would not
          occur.

    •     Gov. Richardson is a private citizen and his views in no way represent U.S. foreign policy.

    •     We remain concerned with the implications of this designation in potentially misrepresenting the views of the ,
          U.S. and the Organization of American States, and intend to raise the matter again with Insulza in light of Gov.
          Richardson's remarks at Brookings on U.S.-Cuba policy.

    •      It is not a paid position.

Fernando —

Has the USOAS mission responded in any manner to this appointment? Does Insulza make these kinds of appointments
on his own or is some type of consultation required? Is it a paid position? Is it clear that he does not represent the U.S. in
any way? I ask this in the context of his recent remarks on Cuba in the wake of this appointment.
