Just a few updates:

  mccain amendment striking offense/defense linkage in preamble to be voted on this afternoon after DADT vote. It
will be defeated. But we are working with mccain to support one or more of his amendments on missile defense to the
Resolution of Ratification.

-- the POTUS letter requested by McCain, Voinovich and others will be released today. It commits to all four phases of
MD and ensures the treaty does not limit our MD plans.
