Fyi, since I'm in Johannesburg I've asked Mike                                     Will keep you posted.


Hope things are going well with the Chinese.


Have had some interesting discussions here including a mtg tonight with a group of about 30 media types where it was
all Libya and BinLaden. Ugh.

As you may have heard, a conservative New York based newspaper, Der Zeitung, photo-shopped
Secretary Clinton and Audrey Tomason out of the Sit Room Bin Laden photo. Not only is this totally
outrageous, it is unacceptable and a clear violation of White House regulations concerning the use
of official photos. I am requesting that the White House issue a formal complaint to Der Zeitung and
request an apology to Secretary Clinton and Ms. Tomason.

Thanks for your help.

Judith
