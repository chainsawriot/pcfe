Subject: Note for S

Please find below a note for S of general interest and relevant for her Monday meeting with Kay Warren. Please let me
know if you recommend any changes. Yours, Lois

To: The Secretary

From: Lois Quam

Date: January 28, 2012

We have indications that our colleagues in USAID are shifting the venue for our global health discussions from the
interagency GHI process led by State to the Congress. The most recent legislation requires the production of two
reports by the Department of State, with the consultation of the USAID Administrator, to Congress: an update on the
benchmark process to be delivered on February 6th and every ninety days thereafter and a report on the implications of
moving from PEPFAR to USAID to be delivered in late May. It is commonly believed, by key stakeholders, that these
reports came at the request of USAID despite USAID's protestations to the contrary.

The House also proposed language to consolidate all global health budgets, including PEPFAR, under USAID. This
language was not included in the final legislation.

The PEPFAR report is relevant for your meeting with Kay Warren on Monday because the faith-based community, and
the global health leaders affiliated with President Bush, were alarmed by these actions and are concerned that USAID's
actions may sever the bipartisan coalition around global health.

Kay may raise this concern with you.
As you know, we have clearly articulated our intention of keeping PEPFAR in the State Department.

This community trusts you and is concerned about a change in position in a new Administration.

The February 6th benchmark report is in Ambassador Sherman's office for transmittal to the Congress.
