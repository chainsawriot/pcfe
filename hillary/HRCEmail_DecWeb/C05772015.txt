Short answer on Kyrgyz contract issue - more later:



The issue here is fuel contracts and the firms that sell us fuel at the Manas Transit Center. Roza wants us to write a new
contract so that the profits are channeled to the GoK rather than the existing private firms. OSD is working on this
possibility, and will have a team in Bishkek soon to determine whether the Kyrgyz SOE concerned can deliver what it
promises.
