Subject: Secretary Gates

The PM of Croatia will arrive to DC on the 24th until the evening of the 26th. She will unfortunately miss Secretay
Clinton - but hopes that her office could please assist with a request to see Secretary Gates. He is in town but his office
has told the embassy that Secretary Clinton must sign off on it. Can one of you assist me with this?
