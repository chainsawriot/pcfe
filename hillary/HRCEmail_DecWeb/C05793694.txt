Subject: Awards

Cheryl,
Below you'll find suggestions for the Secretary's awards when she leaves. I have worked closely with Joe and John in
compiling the list, and I went broader, rather than leaner, to give you an opportunity to cut or move as you see fit. A
few considerations:

      •     The Distinguished Service Award (DSA)is the highest award S can bestow. It only requires her approval. The
            Distinguished Honor Award (DHA), also very prestigious, must be approved by an Awards Committee. So the
            DSA is "easier" to award. But Linda Thomas-Greenfield has committed to move DHA nominations through the
            approval process quickly.
      •     This list is only for State Department Employees (FS, Civil Service, and Schedule C) and uniformed
            military. Schedule Cs and military cannot receive monetary awards.
      •     The Secretary also has at her discretion use of a "Tribute of Honor" award that the Chief of Protocol helps
            bestow that she can give to non-State/military – e.g., to members of Congress who've been particularly helpful
            or leaders of NG0s. Something for us to consider—I have not done so here.
      •     A few of the participants are listed to "make them whole" – meaning their sucessesors got the award and they
            didn't. This is true for the S Specials,

            Finally, you might consider whether you want any Award Ceremonies upon her departure. Would she want to
            honor all of the DSAs in a ceremony on the 8th floor for example? Would she be willing to take a picture with
            Ops, the Line, etc., for her 5 or 6 Group Awards, presenting the Director with the Award? If she presents
            Tributes of Honor, would she want an event for NGOs or civil society leaders?
      •     In addition to these awards, there is also the Richard C. Holbrooke Award for Diplomacy, which the President
            established in late December 2010 and announced at his memorial service. The memo creating the award
            indicates it could be awarded annually; it is not limited to State, or USG, personnel. It affords her the
            opportunity to present a list of nominees from which he can select up to 5 -- that's supposed to happen 60 days
            prior to the award date, so it would potentially be hard to do prior to the end of administration, but we could
            certainly try. To the best of my knowledge, the Secretary has.not yet presented nominees for the President's
            consideration.
