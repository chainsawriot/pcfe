 Separate from what's happening in regards to the Christmas attack, Jeremy Bash just called me because
 Director Panetta wanted him to relay through me that the CIA suffered a terrible incident yesterday in
 Afghanistan.

Seven of their agents were meeting with a contact when an explosion killed them all. To the extent it's
currently being reported, they are being identified as DoD personnel, not Agency.

The details are thin and he couldn't get into more detail on an open line, but they believe the contact they met
with set them up and was either carrying the explosive or detonated it.

They believe this is the greatest loss of life to a single incident in the Agency's history, and the first time that
Agency personnel have been so deliberately targeted in Afghanistan.

Director Panetta's at home in Monterey, CA, and likely returning to DC in the coming days.
