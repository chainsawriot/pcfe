Subject: Acceptance by Heidi Rediker to be the first Chief Economist at the Department

Bob, Pat, Tom, Bill et al:

I am happy to report that Heidi has just agreed to join us at the Department as Chief Economist. Her position will be A/S
level and once she is ready to come on board, we will make an announcement.

Heather:

If you can see if it is at all possible to achieve this in the next 2-3 weeks (she has done the paperwork), we all would be
grateful.

Please join me in welcoming her to the team.

Best.
