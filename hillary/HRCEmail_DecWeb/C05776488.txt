I will spare you the details of the computer disaster we suffered, which always happens at critical times, but we lost a
night of work. We are back on draft and will have a draft ready for you to engage much more closely with -- line edits etc
around noon. We will also have to send that version to WH to have any hope of making friday deadline, which is
absolutely hard. We will still b able to make changes in editing process though.




The good news is that I do think the piece is getting better and better, which is also improving the QDDR itself.
