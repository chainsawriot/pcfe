Jake -

Happy New Year.

The new Spanish foreign minister asked that Secretary Albright pass along a message before Secretary Clinton meets
with him this weekend.
It runs something like this:

The new Spanish Government wants to re-orient Spanish foreign policy so that it can work with the US in Latin America,
especially on Venezuela and Cuba. This will be a significant change from the policies of the previous Spanish
Government.

As a transition in Cuba and something significant in Venezuela (and possibly the Andes) loom, a stronger working
relationship between the US and Spain could be very helpful.

This Spanish Government anticipates that it will again lead EU discussions about Latin America.

The Minister hopes that Secretary Clinton and he can talk this weekend about how to frame a stronger working
relationship.

Thanks, Jake. The US Embassy in Madrid will deliver a message along these lines, I'm sure. All this comes to me through
a mutual friend of the minister's and mine, so several similar messages are probably hitting you at once.

My guess is that the request to Secretary Albright comes in part because she and the last conservative government in
Spain worked pretty well in Latin America, but that got a bit more difficult in the Bush years even before the Spanish
governments changed.

Hope that this helps.

Regards,

Jim
