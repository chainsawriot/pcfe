Subject: Rankings

Per your request, Nora asked me to look over the Partnership for Public Service's "Best Places to Work" rankings and
come up with a strategy for what would drive up our rankings compared with other federal agencies.

DOS ranks #7, which is the highest ranking for a Cabinet-level agency. We rank #3 for Strategic Management and in the
top 7 for Effective Leadership (#4), Support for Diversity (#5), Teamwork (#4), Training and Development (#6), and Pay
(#7).

Our downfall is Family Friendly Culture/Benefits and Work/Life Balance, where we rate #27 and #19 respectively.

The family friendly culture and benefits category measures the extent to which employees believe family-friendly
flexibilities are offered to them, including telecommuting and alternative work scheduling, along with personal support
benefits like child care subsidies and wellness programs. The work/life balance category measures the extent to which
employees consider their workloads reasonable and feasible, and managers support a balance between work and life.

I will get Pat's thoughts on both of these and set up a time to meet with someone at the Partnership for Public Service to
get a sense of what feedback they received from DOS employees in the survey and programs that may be in place in
other agencies who fared better in these categories. These two categories could also tie in with the work Jen/Rachel
will be doing to increase recruitment, promotion and training women, so I will speak with them about this as well.

Many thanks.
