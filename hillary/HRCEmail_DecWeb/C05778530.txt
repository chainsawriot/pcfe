Bottom line: Measles has essentially been ruled out in Haiti at this time. The recent investigation reinforces the
vulnerability of Haiti to measles outbreaks and the importance of strengthening routine immunization services.

More detail below if interested.

Thanks for your interest, help and support.

Details:

           An infant from the US traveled to Haiti in early January for one week and developed measles on return to the
US. Unrelated to this, a Haitian orphanage reported a cluster of             in a nearby geographic area in the weeks prior
to the infant's travel. Samples from two children at the orphanage were weakly reactive to measles, suggesting recent
infection. Despite this remarkable confluence of events, we are now confident that the infant did NOT contract measles
in Haiti. Furthermore, there is NO chance that the infant spread measles in Haiti. To exclude the possibility of measles
in Haiti, the CDC, in conjunction with partners:
     • Trekked to the orphanage (in a remote area) and confirmed that the illness was chickenpox, not measles;
     • Travelled to several other locations visited by the infant in Haiti and found no reports of illness consistent with
          measles;
     • Conducted additional laboratory analyses indicating that the initial weak reactivity was not indicative of measles
          infection;
     • Traced, along with US health departments, the infant and another traveler to JFK airport on 12/31 — both were
          likely exposed to a third, unidentified person who infected them with measles. Both the infant and the other
          traveler became ill 2 weeks later.

    The incident confirms the vulnerability of Haiti to measles and the need to strengthen routine immunization, as is
    planned for later in 2011.
