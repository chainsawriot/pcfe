I just copied you on an email. Jennifer Palmieri called me bic they are announcing at the all staff meeting Monday that
John is stepping down as President to take on a part time role advising S and that Neera is stepping up. They plan on
doing a subsequent press release, I think she said Tuesday, but obviously it will leak Monday. Call me if you want to talk
more about this but there's not much more. I connected her with Mike and Caitlin.
