Subject: Assange to be extradited from UK to Sweden (SBU)

(SBU) London's High Court upheld an earlier court's ruling to extradite Julian Assange from the UK to Sweden
to face questioning on alleged sex crimes, according to press. Embassy London comments while Assange will
likely have the opportunity to appeal, the UK Supreme Court is not expected to overturn the decision.
