Neera--




  Second, I will make a speech at CAP and have told Jake we need to schedule before the end of the year. The reason for
going to CFR again is because it's an anniversary of the one I gave there last year, and it serves as a report on what we've
accomplished. So we should look for a subject and time as soon as possible.

  I confess I'm bewildered at how poorly the Dems are doing in driving any message and putting the Rs on the defensive.
Do you and CAP have any ideas as to how to change the dynamic--before it's too late? Losing the House woud be a
disaster in every way.

 And, thanks for your good wishes on the Middle East negotiations which need ali the help they can get!

                                                                                            All the best--H

Subject: a few things

Hillary,

I've been meaning to write you about a few things, but thought it unwise to disturb before the Peace Talks. And may I
say congratulations on all your work leading up to this week and an incredibly successful start- I feel much more
optimistic knowing your role in guiding these efforts.

First, i think there will be a story in the Times ahead of the 6 month anniversary of the bill (they've been looking for a
hook) on how your ideas shaped the bill. The anniversary is 9/23 and there will be a slew of hopefully popular insurance
reforms being implemented as of that day, so there will be a fair amount of health care news. They've had a hard time
nailing down some elements (like the FEHBP), and so it's not totally fleshed out, but that's the plan as of now.

Second, I know you're going to CFR for a major speech this week. it would be great if you could come to CAP soon.
We're happy to have you for any topic you'd like to make news on. Geithner came recently to focus on the big middle
class tax cut fight well have in September, and that worked well. Our team is especially interested in the unified
national security budget, or START, but really anything you want to make news on would be great.

Again, though things are pretty depressing domestically, it's good to have see bright spots on the world front, and for
that we all owe you thanks.

Neera
