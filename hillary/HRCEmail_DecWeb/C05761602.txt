Subject: Sec Gates speech at Shangri-La conference

Cheryl -

Sec Gates asked me to forward for comment the attached draft of the speech he is scheduled to give at next week's
Shangri-La conference in Singapore. He is not necessarily looking for a staff response, but rather wanted to give Sec
Clinton the opportunity to raise concerns or provide inputs as appropriate.

Thanks

Robert
