In addition to the options memo on S/WCI, I wanted to send you some purely personal thoughts about this

to the idea that S/WCI might move and stakeholder open-mindedness about where S/WCI might move to, and
for many reasons have not wanted to directly inject my personal views into that).



In broad brush, I think about 5 issues when I think about where S/WCI should go:
