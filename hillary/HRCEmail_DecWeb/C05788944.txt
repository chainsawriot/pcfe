Hillary;
FYI. You are going to see the new Spanish Foreign Minister. Ana Palacio, a former foreign minister, and a good friend,
wanted me to let you know that he will be a great new and helpful colleague--in contrast to his predecessor--He is a
committed Atlantisist and NATO supporter. He also wants to be helpful in Latin America especially in the most difficult
countries.
I do not know him but Ana thought it would be really worth your time to get to know him and worth more than just a
quick pull-aside in Munich All best Madeleine
