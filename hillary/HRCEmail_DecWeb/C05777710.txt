Subject: Update: Police are attempting to clear protesters in Manama, Bahrain (SBU)

(SBU) Embassy Manama reports 40 to 50 Bahraini tanks are in the capital and the Interior Minister told the British
Ambassador the government "will work within Bahraini law to break up illegal demonstrations." Post believes the
government is preparing to use violence because protesters crossed "red lines" in terms of denouncing the king and the
royal family. Embassy Manama is closed February 17, with only emergency personnel reporting to work. Post will send
out a message to the American community. Internet connectivity and e-mail access is limited. Embassy Manama is
coordinating closely with the U.S. Navy base in Bahrain.
