  Our Global Health Initiative works closely with host nations, helping them build their capacity to
  run their health care systems. GHI also coordinates all our efforts in a country so that our work
  has the greatest possible reach and impact on the ground. So far, we have worked with more
  than 40 countries to develop integrated strategies that focus on improving health systems instead
  of providing individual services. Through GHI, we are leveraging our resources and platforms to
  secure an AIDS-free generation, end preventable child deaths, and save the lives of mothers
  around the world.
