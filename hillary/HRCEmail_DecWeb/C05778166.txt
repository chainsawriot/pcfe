  Proposed co-marking with the USAID identity and the U.S. flag:



  1).For the English-language (the one on the left could be for something large like a generator-,
  the one on the right is for a smaller item such as a water filter and more compressed:




                                                                                        NEF

                                                                                  FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE




  2). Depending on the audience and the language of the document, the tagline of the USAID
  identity may appear in other languages. In those cases, the same composition as in item 1 above
  will be used, but with the language as dictated by the audience or the language or the document.

  For example, for Urdu-speaking audiences, an Urdu-language tagline will be used:




                          USAID
                           PIS                                            USAID

  4). For plaques and other materials where it is important to demonstrate the partnership of the
  two involved countries, we recommend to use the two-flag approach, such as in the sample
