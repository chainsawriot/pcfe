I can talk secure today btw 3-8pm on the plane ride to DC (IF phones work--always a question) or before 11 on either Sat
or Sun. Does that work for you?

Thanks, glad I can help. Looking forward to going back. Leaving Sunday, stopping in Paris to do some civil nuclear
meetings then into Geneva to meet with Antonov on Tuesday.
Looking forward to talking when convenient on secure line this weekend.

Lavrov thanked me for sending Ellen to Geneva and was delighted to hear she would be back on the 9th and would stay
until we reached agreement. You can read the memcon for more details.
