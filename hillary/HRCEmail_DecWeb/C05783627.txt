My usual refrain these days:                            I talked       about it last night.

Do you know status of the Dalai Lama visit(s) decision? If I'm going to see him, I will have to do before we leave on trip.

No mention by anyone of need for secure.

I would hazard late afternoon, like 4 or 5. With an outside chance, given how these things play, of tomorrow am.

Incidentally, Huma mentioned to me that                                                         on the Turkey points for the
call. I didn't know if that meant HE was also planning to call on that (he didn't call Davut). But for your situational
awareness.

Do you have any idea of when call"will occur and does it need to be secure?

                              Based on their conversations over the next few hours, they will adjust the call points, send
the call sheet, and then the time can be fixed.
