First, happy mother's day!

Would be good to bug         again this evening at the Dai dinner on

EI-Obeidy got across the border and was picked up by the French embassy. They are not telling us much, other than
hinting that she may already be Sone from Tunisia. I've been in touch with Khalil.

Joint Staff is supposed to be working with NATO on advice for how to intensify. More on that as it unfolds.

See you tonight at the dinner.
