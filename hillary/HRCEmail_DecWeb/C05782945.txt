Subject: RE: Iran/UN: Next Steps

I will send to you shortly the readout of my conversation with Ryabkov this morning which is somewhat more optimistic
about coming to a common place. He was very welcoming of a team and Bill Wood is now scheduled to be in Moscow
with his team n the 16'. Agree sending a team back to the UN would be a good step. Will talk with Bob Godec about
what we can get to you as soon as possible.

RUSSIAN STATEMENT

Comments by Russian MFA Spokesman Alexander Lukashevich

1544-12-10-2011

Moscow has received with concern reports about alleged plans to commit terrorist attacks in the US, inter
alia against the ambassador of Saudi Arabia in Washington.

Russia is a consistent opponent of terrorism, about which people in our country know not by hearsay. We
condemn it in all its forms and manifestations.

We presume that effective counteraction to terrorist challenges lies in the domain of increasing broad
international cooperation. We are ready to interact to attain this aim with all interested nations, including
the United States of America.

The whole information on this subject will be most carefully studied and analyzed by us.
