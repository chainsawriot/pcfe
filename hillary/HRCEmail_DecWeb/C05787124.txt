Subject: My departure


As you know Cheryl and I been trying to identify candidates for my position after I leave. We have
rrncHrd a number of internal and external candidates including
          or a variety of reasons so far none have worked out. Frankly at this point I am out of ideas
so I suggested to Cheryl that we reach out to Maggie. Not sure if you have mentioned it to her so I
just wanted you to know I am going to try and set up a time to talk to her.

In terms of timing, I have told Cheryl I would like to leave as early next month as possible. I had
planned to stay at least through the India education meetings in early June but since those have
now been postponed until the Fall I have no major meetings or events on my calendar. If you have
not identified a successor by the time of my departure then I would recommend that you consider
naming Ann as Acting Under-Secretary. She is now very familiar with both the "building" and what
we are trying to achieve in terms of a new direction for Public Diplomacy. She also has a very strong
P/DAS in Adam Ereli who can mange ECA for her.

As I have told both you and Cheryl, my decision to leave at this point has been one of hardest
decisions I have ever had to make. I am incredibly honored to have been given this opportunity and
very proud of everything we have done to help turn your vision for diplomacy in the 21st century into
reality. However, I now have a number of personal and family matters which require my urgent
attention. I will of course be available to support my successor and provide you with any information
or help I can.

Thanks again for all your support.
