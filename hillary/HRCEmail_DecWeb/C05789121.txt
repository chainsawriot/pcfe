Cheryl,

I want to pass along to you my understanding that the situation            is improving,                     undertook a
survey to understand staff morale and the climate at the mission. He took the results seriously and convened a retreat
to restart/renew his relationship with his organization. I understand that his efforts have been appreciated and that all
parties are working towards a fresh approach.

Please let me know if you would like further details.

Yours,

Lois
