Subject: Re my meetings

BB father in law died suddenly whilst I was there so I met Ron and Molcho. I also saw Fayyad and Erekat. I will see BB
and Abbas when I go back next week. The only way forward I can see ( and that is not hugely probable!) is as follows :
                                                                                                                         1.4(B)
                                                                                                                         1.4(D)
                                                                                                                         B1
