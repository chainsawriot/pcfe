I know, it's incredible - that's part of the reason why I wrote the column. Planned Parenthood sent it out on their list
serve so it's gotten a lot of exposure.

There's clearly a potent strain of misogyny in our country- and some events (contraception, your campaign) finally
expose it.

At least the WH is over its super panic on this. The Church still scares the crap out a lot of these guys.

In January 1998, in the run-up to the twenty-fifth anniversary of Roe v. Wade, then-First Lady Hillary Clinton held a
meeting in the Map Room of the White House with leaders of women's groups ranging from Planned Parenthood to the
National Women's Law Center. The meeting took place in the aftermath of the painful and polarizing debate on late-
term abortion—a debate in which conservatives capitalized on a seemingly extreme abortion position in order to
bludgeon progressive leaders. In that meeting (I was there, as a staffer for the First Lady), Clinton pushed the groups to
develop a proactive agenda around women's health, one that would shift the debate away from a rarely used procedure
and back toward the reproductive health needs of women. And if that debate took place in a way that demonstrated the
extremes of the anti-choice position—so be it. Over the course of the discussion, Clinton and the leaders in the room hit
on the issue of contraception: specifically, promoting contraceptive coverage in health care plans.

Fourteen years later, the strategy formed in the White House in 1998 is being tested on the national level, as we debate
the Obama Administration's contraceptive coverage proposal. But today's debate differs from the one that took place in
the '90s—when many states passed laws mandating contraception coverage—in one troubling way: the vociferous
opposition by religious groups. The past few months have seen the issue of contraception coverage turned into a
question of religious liberty. And, initially at least, that rhetorical shift by conservatives made an enormous political
difference.

Before it was made into a religious issue, contraception was a subject where the majority of Americans were firmly on
the side of women's rights: Most people viewed it as a basic health protection, not a controversial issue. And that's why
it was also successful as a political cudgel, helping isolate extreme anti-choice advocates from the mainstream. Indeed, it
was a Republican Senator, Olympia Snowe, who introduced the Equity in Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive
Coverage Act (which lacked any sort of "conscience exception") in 1999, and plenty of Republicans co-sponsored it.

That extent of mainstream sympathy for contraception coverage was especially evident on the state level. At the time,
state affiliates of women's organizations started pushing contraceptive coverage in state legislatures—and in many
places, they passed. One such organization was NARAL-NY, which advocated for the Women's Health and Wellness Act
in New York in 1999 and 2000. The legislation—like the original Obama policy—only allowed an exemption for houses of
worship, not religiously affiliated hospitals or colleges, perhaps because its authors recognized that the vast majority of
employees at these institutions are not Catholic. But the Catholic Church did not actively resist, or try to prevent the
bill's passing. At the time, the Church said that, in its affiliated hospitals, it would "continue for the immediate future
providing the contraception coverage under formal protest<http://www.timesunion.com/opinion/article/lt-s-a-matter-
of-conscience-3087383.php>." This was far from the cries of "religious coercion" that we see today.

And, in some states, religious groups were silent altogether. In 1999, New Hampshire passed a law requiring
contraceptive coverage in all prescription drug plans. (The law was
passed<http://www.nprorg/2012/02/24/147326639/n-h-gop-moves-to-revise-states-contraception-law> by a
Republican legislature and signed by a Democratic governor.) Both lawmakers and religious groups never raised the
issue of religious liberty during the legislative debate; in fact, there was not a single discussion on that issue according to
the legislative history.

How could it be that the Catholic Church did not object, and did not threaten to spend millions of dollars defeating
political opponents? Simply put, contraception coverage was seen as part and parcel of health care access.

And, if Obama's rising approval rating among women<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/us/politics/obama-
campaign-plans-big-effort-to-court-women.html?pagewanted=2&_r=2&hp> is any indication, it still is today. Moreover,
after some initial uncertainty surrounding the politics of the contraception measure, it is now clear that a solid majority
of Americans (63 percent) support it. Fourteen years ago, leaders of the women's movement saw contraception as a
unifying issue, one that the vast majority of Americans would support. They strategized that those who opposed
contraception would be seen as extreme. In the past several weeks, they were proven right.
