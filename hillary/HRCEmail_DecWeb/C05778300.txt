Sir: FYI...separately, USUN reported that the Chinese, who have the UNSC Presidency this month, indicated that they do
not want the issue of the no-fly zone coming up for consideration this month. This adds to the other opposition you
have probably seen in the press and elsewhere. Akunna

I'm borrowing Eric's computer as my low side is still down. I can be reached on SIPR.

Further to my email on the high side, the Secretary General just called Susan, to report that Dervis is unavailable to take
the job down                                                          As the Turkish PR told Susan last, night, the
Secretary General also indicated that the Turks are pressing him to chose, Yasar Yakis, a former Turkish foreign minister
and ambassador to NATO, Egypt and Saudi Arabia (a bio is attached). The Secretary General is seriously considering him,
and has asked for the USG's thoughts.

Please copy Salman Ahmed (copied here), Eric Pelofsky and Calista Johnson so that I see your responses while my email
problems are fixed. Alternatively, Dan/Sam if you want to convene a conference call, that might be faster. I am free at
11:00.

Thanks -
Erica
