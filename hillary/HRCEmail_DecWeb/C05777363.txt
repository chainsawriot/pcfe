Guys — we just concluded ad ref agreement with the GoJ on a new five year Host Nation Support Agreement that will
provide about $1.8 billion dollars a year in direct financial support for US forces stationed in Japan (total = around $9
billion over five years). There are substantial areas of restructuring and new resources devoted to energy efficiency and
facilities improvement. It's a good deal for both sides,

Everything will be ready for announcement by Potus-PM in Japan later this week. My office will be distributing details of
the agreement and information for back grounding purposes. I will be in touch with Jeff and Danny on various points.
We just came out of the final deliberations with GoJ and wanted to be sure that you all were informed.




Best, Kurt.
