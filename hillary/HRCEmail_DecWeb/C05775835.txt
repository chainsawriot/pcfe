                                                                               APR 21 2010

            The Honotable Kent Conrad
            Chairman
            Committee on the Budget .
            United States Senate
            Washington, DC 20510

            Dear Mr. Chairman:

                   I am writing to express my strong support for full funding of the President's FY 2011
            foreign affairs budget request (the 150 account) which, along with defense, is a critical
            component of an integrated and effective national security program.

                    I understand this year presents a challenging budget environment, with competing
            domestic and international pressures. However, I strongly believe a robust civilian foreign
            affairs capability, coupled with a strong defense capability, is essential to preserving U.S.
            national security interests around the world.

                    State and USAID partners are critical to success in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq. Ow
            military and civilian missions are integrated, and we depend upon our civilian counterparts to
            help stabilize and rebuild after the fight. As U.S. forces transition out of war zones, the U.S.
            goverment needs our civilian agencies to be able to assume critical functions. This allows us,
            for example, to draw down U.S. forces in Iraq responsibly while ensuring hard-fought gain% are
            secured. Cuts to the 150 account will almost certainly impact our efforts in these critical
            frontline states.

                    in other parts of the world, the work performed by diplomatic and development
            professionals helps build the foundation for more stable, democratic and prosperous societies.
            These are places where the potential for conflict can be minimized, if not completely avoided, by
            State and USAID programs â€” thereby towering the likely need for deployment of U.S. military
            assets.

                    In formulating his request for FY 2011, the President carefully considered funding needs
            for the budget accounts for both foreign affairs and national defense, tatting into account overall;
            national security requirements as well as economic conditions. 1 believe that full funding of
            these two budget accounts is necessary for our national security and for ensuring our continued ,
            leadership in the world. I hope you will take this into:account when acting upon the President's
            FY 2011 budget request.

          missions are increasingly integrated with those of our Defense Department
          counterparts, as we have seen demonstrated time and again in Iraq, Afghanistan,
          and other parts of the world. Cuts to the civilian components can no longer be seen
          in isolation or having lithe impact on our national security strategy.
                 Our investments in development and diplomacy are smart, cost-effective,
          and squarely in the best interests of American taxpayers and our national security.
          They are also relatively small compared to the cost of active militaty engagement,
          and they can end up delivering impactful savings. In Iraq, For example, our $2.6
          billion request for State and USAID will allow the Defense Department budget to
          decrease by about $16 billion - a powerful illustration of the return on civilian
          investments.

                  ask Ibr your strong support of our budget request and you have my pledge
          that we will work diligently to ensure that this funding is used as efficiently and
          effectively as possible.


                                                 Sincerely yours.
