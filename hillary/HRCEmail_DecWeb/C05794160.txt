What could be true is that the Korans did contain marginalia that was not only extremist but directive as to actions
prisoners should take. That would justify removing but not burning. That's our problem.

Where did          get your email address, Professor Mills?

Dear Professor Mills,

I am sorry for bothering you, but I wanted to make sure that this had               the highest
escalation. I have already emailed people in the USMC because I think               the whole way the
United States reacted to this was poorly thought out. I know (from my               prior service) the
Afghan people, and the reason that I know the following is because it               is commonly known
through the News Media.

Wahhabi oriented charities and Madrases in Saudi Arabia have been well funded by the
Saudi Royal Family and the more Radical Clerics have purchased professional book printing
equipment and have printed Qurans that as you already know have adulterated or
bastardized the solumm text of the orthodox writings and have supplemented radical
sayings to attack Jews, Israel, and Infidels including Americans. Instead of going public
with our leadership looking incredibly stupid and contrite before the Afghan People and
Arab Language Press outlets, I would suggest that we be brutally honest that someone in
Saudi Arabia committed blasphemy, re authored the Quran in such a way as if someone
thought they were smarter than Allah. That the United States regarded this as an unholy
abomination and decided to burn it as it should because after all this was an unholy
propaganda tool for extremists. You say this, and they will accept that, rather than we
merely screwed up one more time!

Sincerely,

ROBERT A. DANFORD
