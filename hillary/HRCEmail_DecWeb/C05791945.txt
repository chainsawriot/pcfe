As I mentioned to Pat, talked twice to Kusa this afternoon, once to appeal again for approval for charter a/c to land at
mil airfield, and then to confirm.

Told Kusa in first call of severity of situation and urgent need to help. He said simply "I know." Added he would try.

In second call he confirmed approval. I thanked him. He replied "it's good they're leaving. It's not really safe here." I said
we'd remember his help.

Strange man in strange country, serving truly certifiable dictator. But at least he did right thing here.

Bill
