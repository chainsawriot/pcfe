Can I ask you to confirm that it's ok that the Embassy do a short press release from warsaw now that announcement is
out. EUR is asking. Fyi here is what we are proposing.

Statement from the U.S. Embassy in Warsaw

The White House today announced President Obama's intention to nominate XXX, to serve as the next U.S. Ambassador
to Poland.

Ambassador Feinstein said "It has been a tremendous honor and privilege to represent the United States in Poland during
the past three years."

"Living in Poland has been a great gift to my family and me. While we are looking forward to returning home, Poland will
always remain dear to us."

"I am proud of what we have accomplished, and I remain committed to working to advance our common security and
prosperity, while I continue to serve in Warsaw and thereafter."
