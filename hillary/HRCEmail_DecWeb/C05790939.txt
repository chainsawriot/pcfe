Cheryl,
Many thanks again for including Secretary Salazar in the meeting with Secretary Clinton and Petrobras. I understand the
Secretaries also shared a small-group dinner on Monday night. Our Secretary really appreciates the consideration, as do I, and
he felt the trip was quite valuable.

Best,
Laura Davis
