    Dear Alice,

    I'm so pleased about your next exciting move. And, you're right, we need you at the White House to help plan and
    execute our Russian strategy post-Putin. We will all miss you in S-land, but are relieved you will not be too far away.

    Thanks for all your great work on my behalf. It's been a professional and personal pleasure getting to know you. I wish
    you the very best in all your future endeavors--H
