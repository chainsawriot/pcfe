   I met with UAE FM Abdullah bin Zayed and Qatari PM/FM Hamad bin Jassim this evening briefly, at their request, to
   discuss Syria.




    I asked how likely it is to get Arab consensus on such an approach.



    Chris and Brian or ELA: can you get us the text of what the Arab League already passed on Syria, so we'd know what the
    draft UNSCR would be drawn from?
