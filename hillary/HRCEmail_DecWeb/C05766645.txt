              0

          Drawing on DHS input, 10 and EEB have drafted a memo to S                                             The
          memo is currently with EEB. We expect to send it up to the 7th floor Tuesday, Feb. 2.
          10, EEB and DHS are working together to prepare for ICAO's aviation security meeting the week of March 22.
