                                              Statement by       the President on Bahrain

I welcome the announcement by King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa about making important changes to the cabinet
and restating his commitment to reform. The United States supports the national dialogue initiative led by
Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, and encourages a process that is meaningful, inclusive, non
sectarian, and responsive to the people of Bahrain. The dialogue offers an opportunity for meaningful reform
and for all Bahrainis to forge a more just future together. As a long standing partner of Bahrain, the United
States continues to believe that Bahrain's stability will be enhanced by respecting the universal rights of the
people of Bahrain and reforms that meet the aspirations of all Bahrainis.
