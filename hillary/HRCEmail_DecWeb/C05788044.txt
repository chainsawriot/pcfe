"Negad" is The IRI/Freedom House Egyptian lawyer. Again, figures are from a variety of Egyptian journalists, but not
confirmed:

"I spoke with Negad and he has a lawyer over at MOJ trying to get any confirmation of this reporting.

Negad spoke to a couple of Journalists who say they are hearing and reporting that:

18 Americans
5 Serbs
2 Germans
3 Arabs
14 Egyptions

are being referred to trial.

Non of this is confirmed by the MoJ with us.

My name is appearing in some local articles as being one of those referred.

Will send more as it becomes available."
