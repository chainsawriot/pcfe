PIs read the second msg I sent rather than the first, which was incomplete before I could finish it, due to IT issues in
Kenya.

Cheryl,

I've just gotten off the phone with Eric and he has asked me to send you a quick update as I conclude my week-long trip
to East Africa in response to the refugee emergency here.

I have spent several days in both Ethiopia and Kenya, where I visited refugee camps on the Ethiopian and Kenyan
borders with Somalia, and I have met with senior government officials from both countries. Among the most important
conclusions from the trip that you may not have heard before:

* This is a MASSIVE emergency that WILL DEFINITELY get worse before it gets better. In addition to potential famine
warnings from inside Somalia, USAID has heard from partners that the rate of flow of refugees across the Kenyan
border could double as early as next week, from 1200 a day to 3000 a day. We have not been able to corroborate those
reports, which come from OFDA partners operating inside Somalia, but we will know soon enough.

* It is the strong view of the Ethiopian and the Kenyan governments (especially the Kenyans) that the international
community must do more to deliver food and NFI assistance inside Somalia. The Kenyans see this as a means of
stemming the refugee flow into Kenya, even as they insist that they will not prevent anyone fleeing Somalia from
crossing the border. COMMENT: Notwithstanding the obvious interest in stemming the refugee flow into Kenya, I
believe the commitment of the GOK in general and the PM in particular to host refugees and to avoid stopping people at
the border. That said, I strongly believe that unless the international community gets substantial food assistance inside
Somalia - either in "liberated areas" or those places under Al-Shabaab control - we will continue to see extraordinary
mortality rates (especially among women and children) as they walk for days without food or water to reach refuge in
Kenya and Ethiopia.

* They Kenyan government continues to insist strongly that the international community must do more provide
development and food assistance to the local host population in the Daddab region, that has been hosting the largest
refugee camp in the world for years and that has been so adversely impacted by the unchecked influx.

                           But I strongly believe that providing such assistance must be seen as an urgent POLITICAL
priority - beyond the powerful merits based solely on development indicators - and must be seen as essential as helping
the GOK honor its international commitments on refugees even as the influx likely becomes an issue in the upcoming
national elections.



                                                For example, it is due in part to the proactive humanitarian diplomacy by
PRM over the last year that we had built up the relations and political capital with governments in the region that gave
us the frank warnings of the unfolding refugee crisis last month, and that crucially helped us to move the governments
of Ethiopia and Kenya to take critical humanitarian actions (like allowing NGOs to operate at refugee transit centers on
the Ethiopian Somali border or the Kenyans finally agreeing to open the IfÂ° II camp) to respond to the crisis. The public
diplomacy we have conducted in the Horn on humanitarian issues throguh press conferences and other means has
helped raise the profile of the USG as a reliable partner and given regional governments the political space within their
own populations to take bold actions for response (especially in Kenya). And working with host governments and donor
countries to move beyond reactive humanitarian response to proactive "theory of the case" for food security
undergirded by good governance - as directed by Secretary Clinton - is an inherently political and diplomatic function.
Thus it is vital that our respnse be led and shaped by diplomatic and policy engagements, both in Washington and in the
region, that will allow our humanitarian interventions to achieve the greatest effect.



These are the most salient points, but happy to give you more detailed reporting of you require it. I'll be back in the
office on Monday.

Many thanks,
Reuben
