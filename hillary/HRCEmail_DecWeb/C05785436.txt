Finally, a note on West Bank and Jerusalem security. Demonstrations numbering in the low hundreds occurred today in
several WB cities (Qalqilya, Hebron, Ramallah), as well as the usual Friday protests against the barrier and in Jerusalem.
As I write, a small demonstration reached the Qalandiya checkpoint, but no injuries have been reported yet. Hamas
supporters turned out in Hebron along the H1/H2 divider, where they chanted anti-Fayyad slogans; the PA was able to
keep the demo away from IDF locations. There were a few isolated skirmishes in Jerusalem's Arab neighborhoods
(Silwan, Issawiya) amidst a heavy Israeli security presence, but no major incidents occurred in the Old City itself. Sunday
is the main event, but as we reported yesterday, the PA chiefs are telling us they should be able to manage the situation,
at least in those areas of the WB that are under their control.
