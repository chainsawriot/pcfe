     Re: Kyrgyzstan


     My friend                                           with two decades of extensive
     dealings in Kyrgyzstan, and
                        has been in close contact with his high-level sources there over the
     past 72 hours, and sends me the following memo. It is particularly well informed on the
     new interim leader, Roza Otunbayeva, whom he knows well, the internal politics post-
     revolution, and how DOD and State are relatively regarded and what that means.

      Subj: Change of Government in Kyrgyzstan



      I have worked in the Kyrgyz Republic continuously since 1991
                   I became acquainted with each of the three Kyrgyz leaders from about that
      time, first meeting Askar Akayev in 1990 in Moscow, Kurmanbek Bakiyev in Djalalabad
      in 1993, and Roza Otunbayeva in Bishkek in 1992. I have had extended dealings with
      each of them on many different matters, largely inside Kyrgyzstan, although I first dealt
      extensively with Otunbayeva when she served as Kyrgyz ambassador in the United
      States.

      Assessment of Otunbayeva: The opposition forces selected Otunbayeva for several
      reasons: (i) among them she is the only figure who commands recognition and respect
      abroad; (ii) in the eyes of the Kyrgyz people she is closely associated with the Kyrgyz

     Tulip Revolution of 2005, yet she alone among the leaders of that revolution upheld its
     idealism, openly castigated Bakiyev and others for their corruption and failure to follow
     through on promises, and personally avoided corruption and graft; and (iii) she lacks a
     strong domestic power base and therefore is seen as less of a threat to the alternative
     candidates. Based on these factors, several of the opposition leaders tell me a quick
     consensus was reached that Otunbayeva should be the provisional leader and the "face to
     the world" of the new revolution.

     Otunbayeva, who is 59, launched her career in the diplomatic service, obtaining the
     position of foreign minister of the Kyrgyz SSR at a precocious age. She served in the
     Soviet Foreign Ministry and caught the eye of Eduard Shevardnadze, who appointed her
     as a vice minister—an unprecedented accomplishment for a Central Asian and for a
     woman then in her late 30s. Shevardnadze told me in 2002 that he had viewed
     Otunbayeva as a person of extraordinary skills, well qualified to succeed him as Soviet
     foreign minister. He noted her ability quickly to grasp complex problems and to propose
     novel and interesting solutions. He called her a "natural diplomat" with an instinctive
     tendency to reconcile, but also with a clear grasp of policy objectives and a methodical
     approach to their accomplishment. My own experience in dealing with Otunbayeva
     confirms these observations. She has a measure of idealism that often guides her policy
     orientation, but she is instinctively pragmatic in her approach.

      Otunbayeva defies categorization in terms of political philosophy. Her political parties,
      first Ata-Jurt ("Fatherland"), then the Social Democrats, are often portrayed as "leftists"
      on the political scale in Kyrgyzstan, but the party orients itself to continental European
      social democrats and to the British Labour Party (with which Otunbayeva has solid
      connections, including with Tony Blair). While schooled in basic concepts of Marxism-
      Leninism, which occasionally appear in conversation (though often as not in a joking
      way), her politics is fundamentally one of pragmatic engagement. She advocates
      maintenance of the republic's Soviet era social net and pays particular attention to health
      and education issues. She was a vigorous advocate for and supporter of the American
      University in Bishkek and was repeatedly identified for board membership—she declined
      one offer saying that her role as an opposition leader would probably complicate the
      university's relations with the government. As ambassador, Otunbayeva went to bat
      aggressively for foreign investors, helped them secure concessions, and advocated for
      them against government red tape. I am unaware of any instance in which she ever
      sought personal gain or advancement in connection with these deals, however. She is
      very unusual among Kyrgyz political figures in her rejection of rent-seeking and her loud
      denunciation of political figures who use their office for personal gain. Indeed, this
      aspect of her personality has won her some respect in the public, but general disdain
      among the political class, who frequently disparage her as "unrealistic."

      Otunbayeva served extended periods in Washington and London as the Kyrgyz
      ambassador. She has a fluent and subtle command of the English language, and a
      broadly positive view of the United States and the United Kingdom. Of the three Kyrgyz
      leaders to date, she is clearly the one with the deepest understanding of American culture
      and the American political environment and the one with the most instinctively pro-

     American leanings.
                                                                                                   1.4(D)
                                                                                                   B1
     Otunbayeva believes that for cultural, commercial and security reasons, a stable
     relationship between Bishkek and Moscow is a matter of primary concern.




     Her Position within the New Government. Opposition leaders with whom I have spoken
     expect that Bakiyev will resign, that the opposition will dissolve parliament and form a
     new interim government with Otunbayeva as its leader and that new elections will then
     soon be called first for president and then for a new parliament. Many of the opposition
     figures doubt that Otunbayeva can be a successful candidate for president especially
     given her weak performance in prior elections to parliament. Tekebayev is more broadly
     expected to emerge as their nominee. However, there is recognition that, Otunbayeva
     may, if she skillfully manages the transition period, develop the necessary popular basis
     and emerge as leader. It is stressed that her prospects increase as relations with foreign
     powers are seen as problematic, since she alone among the opposition figures is viewed
     as having the stature and skills necessary to cope with difficult foreign affairs problems.

     positive view of U.S. ambassador Tatiana Gfoeller.

      One other fact is very important here: Otunbayeva herself is a professional diplomat.
      She will strongly prefer to address these issues through diplomatic dialogue with other
      professional diplomats.
                                                      All of this suggests to me the necessity for
      the State Department to assert itself and take the lead in developing relations with the
      new government.
