Just updated from Roly, with polls closed over 1 million polling locations were matched for voters.

Debrief and analysis to follow but great news on SMS system use.

Nice job. Nice job all.

You do great elections.

And make us all look good.

I am so very grateful for all you have done.

Dinner on me in Haiti next trip.

At Mulet mtg UN reported some problems from much earlier today at Dessalines (artibonite) (people shot) and in the
NorthEast. But by in large, quite quiet. Polls in PaP will remain open til 1700 (vice 1600) to accommodate stations that
opened late. Even issues a press release saying this! Martelly folks seem pretty confident things are going their way.
Some IntlCom folks worried they may make statement tonight implying Martelly won. Peter will do a wrap-up e-mail
later. This may be the last report from me unless something unexpected happens. Heading back home. KM

Not much new to report. Voting continues. Media seems to have been well backgrounded by the lavalas (BBC, the
World) that "candidate" aristide was cheated. I Said was surprised as he is ineligible to be candidate.... Also going to say
turnout not "massive" ergo "illegitimate."

NDI does not seem to be getting enough info to make a projection today. Could still change, if more folks report.
