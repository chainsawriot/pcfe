I'd rather see      do the AfPak job.                                                                                        B5

OK, following your email last night I pitched all on the list I sent you (and added               for good measure since I
heard from Dana that she would not be interested in QDDR). So far                                                            B5
said they might be interested, but said they wanted the weekend to discuss with spouses, etc before allowing their           B6
names to go forward. Can we hold off             until then? I have not heard back from the others, but will follow up
today.
                                                                                                                     B5
                                                                                                                     B6
