dear Mr chollet,hope all is well .It was pleasure to meet you.allow me please to write the
following points for your own consideration:
1-true there was unrest ,but it could have been solved in many ways quickly and peacefully if
the good intention was there by all parties .the intervention by the international community was
not honest to say the
least ,they had an Axe to grind .they complicated things, they did not save any more blood or
lives ,on the contrary more blood was shed more lives were wasted.
2- from day one you could smell a rat ...a plot ... the Arab League, the involvement of some
Arab countries.
3-from day one there was hostile ill intentioned fabricated media campaign to mention but a
few: Aljazeera ,Alarabia ALHUURA.... THE LIES THEY TOLD Good me . a campaign of
deliberate lies, incitation, and misleading information.
4-there were no mercenaries period. this is a fact.
5-there were no bombing on civilians by aircraft period. this is a fact too, a double fact.
6-those protesters lost transparency, virginity, credibility and legitimacy from day one when
they resorted to violence , arms ,killing , attacking and burning police stations and military
camps.needless to say they lost all when they seeked the backing of foreigners, of NATO
...foreign backing against their fellow citizens whatever the pretext.
 7-make no mistake about it that the Nato campaign is a war of aggression.mission creep, regime
 change . all of course in total violation of UNSC resolution 1973.indeed in violation of all

international laws and ethics.
8- the killing of civilians ,and destroying of houses and gov buildings and the infrastructure is
morally and legally wrong.
9- if killing people -is you say- people by gov forces is wrong ,then by the same token it is
wrong too for NATO to kill civilians in the name of protecting civilians-
10- it is wrong too and make regime change by force- international laws do not allow that - we
should not set a precedent- any gov that comes on foreign military aircraft is neither accepted
nor respected -
11- Libyan tribes playa decisive role- bear this in mind- do not ignore it - irrespective of
weather x goes or stays -
12- bear in mind the possibility of civil war -
13- you want to stop the war - you want to find a political solution - you want the Libyan people
to decide for them selves ,you do not want to impose a gov - you want good future for Libya ,
you want Libya united , you want democracy , we want that too we are in agreement , what
does trigger that ? - the A u road map - end of NATO bombing > cease fire > national dialogue
of all parties by all Libyans to decide what ever they want
14- America is a big country and should help Libyans to come together for a national political
talk - The big should not bother about small things for the sake of the big ones , The big should
always be more tolerant , more patient , more understanding more forgiving , The big do not
bother that much about number four coming before number one for the sake of the final noble
aim that is peace and saving lives .
I do hope you understand what I mean - regards .
