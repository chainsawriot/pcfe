Subject: The Secretary's Gallup Speech

Friends: Just a quick note to extend my deepest congratulations and appreciation for the remarkable speech by
Secretary Clinton at the Gallup event today. It was smart, savvy, and sophisticated, and set the exact right tone for the
program. It was chocked filled with applause lines, fascinating examples, and insights. It was also frustrating
comprehensive: I know, because I had to scrap my prepared comments and find something new to say. I plan to
plagiarize her comments liberally from now on. Thanks so much for helping the Department and USAID put our
collective best feet forward. Kindest regards. Don
