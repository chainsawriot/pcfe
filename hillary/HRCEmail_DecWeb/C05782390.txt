Will check. The story about the woman is quite chilling.

Re: Rumor: Q's rape policy


I communicated more than a week ago on this story—Qaddafi placing bodies to create PR stunts about
supposed civilian casualties as a result of Allied bombing—though underlining it was a rumor. But now, as you
know, Robert Gates gives credence to it. (See story below.)

Sources now say, again rumor (that is, this information comes from the rebel side and is unconfirmed
independently by Western intelligence), that Qaddafi has adopted a rape policy and has even distributed Viagra
to troops. The incident at the Tripoli press conference involving a woman claiming to be raped is likely to be
part of a much larger outrage. Will seek further confirmation.

WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration says the Libyan government's claims of civilians killed in
airstrikes are unproven.

Defense Secretary Robert Gates says "the truth of the matter is we have trouble coming up with proof of any
civilian casualties that we have been responsible for."
Gates said there were numerous intelligence reports suggesting Moammar Gadhafi's regime was taking bodies
of people killed by the pro-government forces and placing them at sites attacked by U.S. planes.
Gates said the American forces and those of other countries enforcing the U.N. resolution to protect Libyan
civilians have been "extremely careful."
Gates spoke Saturday in an interview pre-taped for CBS News' "Face The Nation" to be aired Sunday.
