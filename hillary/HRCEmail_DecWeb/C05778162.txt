Talked to Frank W. twice â€” he is prepared to go, to work through conference calls,                             if that is
the best approach. He would like a 1-minute call              and a call from you to Mubarak to set it up. As soon as we
get points done, we'll send them to Frank and then do an internal conference call.

Burns also talked with Euro political directors. They all said your messaging was spot-on,
                     They are using your statement as a template for what they will do individually and as the EU.
