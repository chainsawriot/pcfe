Subject: Republican Hold

Just a bit of an update as we head into the Senate recess.

The Senate Republicans have placed a general hold on all administration nominees due to a scuffle over a Nuclear
Regulatory Commission nomination. Apparently, the WH pledged to nominate someone with Republican support to the
NRC, which they did â€” his hearing is tomorrow in front of EPW. Rs however are insisting that the hearing is not enough;
they want the nominee to be reported out and confirmed before Memorial Day. That's an extraordinary step.

We're told by the WH there's little likelihood of coming to a resolution. Nevertheless, the WH, Reid and McConnell are
still talking.

Thanks.
