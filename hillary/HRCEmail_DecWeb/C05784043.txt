Jake,
FYI, Chinese postponed my visit to talk about Iran and NK because of POTUS meeting with Dalai Lama.

Colleagues,
Please see below regarding the MFA postponement of Mr. Einhorn's trip to Beijing next week, due to recent meetings.
Since he and Richard may have already departed for Korea, I wanted to widen distribution to ensure the proper travel
accommodations can be made.
Regards,
Deji

Colleagues,
MFA Arms Control Dept. Director Sun Lei informed me at 1830 pm that, "in light of the current situation, China has
decided to postpone the consultations with Robert Einhorn" scheduled for July 20-21. Sun added that China attached
importance to these consultations but the U.S. should clearly know why China is postponing them, and that "the
responsibility is not on the Chinese side." He said that we cannot request cooperation on issues of concern to the U.S.
while not cooperating on issues of concern to China. I noted that the issues Mr. Einhorn would discuss are of concern
not only to the U.S., but also to China and many other countries.
