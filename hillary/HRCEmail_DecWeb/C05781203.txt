Subject: (SBU) Israel-Turkey Update: Lieberman Signals Moderation; Deep Concern with Erdogan's Latest Statement

Today's developments from the Israel side:

FM Lieberman gave a press statement Sunday morning on the margins of the regular Sunday
morning full Cabinet meeting. He said he was for improving relations with Turkey, that it is
in the interests of both countries, but he was opposed to giving an apology. However, the
new element - carried in today's tabloid Yediot (and in English YNet) was his statement: . "I
do not expect this to lead to a Coalition crisis even if there will be an apology."

                                                                                                                            1.4(B)

The inner cabinet did not meet today, despite Maariv and other press reports that it
would. Dermer said it had not been scheduled yet, but he expects it soon. He said the PM
and much of the government were consumed today with initiatives to respond to the growing
street protests over housing shortages and low wages.

Comment: The PM has what he needs from Lieberman to go forward. In our communications in the next few days, we
will stress that Erdogan's latest statement and the housing protests should not provide another excuse to delay. My first
opportunity will be when I present my credentials to the MFA tomorrow.
