Subject:                          NZ update



Madame Secretary: Just a brief update. First your embassy team and young FSOs are responding heroically to the many
challenges we confront in Christ Church. Every member of the dialogue and their family are accounted for. I made sure
personally that all have replacement passports and return flights. There are now three unaccounted Americans in the
city. We are working closely with government to get up to date and accurate information.
                                         This is critical as already this is the worst disaster in NZ history. Over 500
buildings very badly damaged and probably over one hundred dead. Our search and rescue team are arriving on scene
shortly. Am encouraging NZ to ask us for water purification as all systems are destroyed around city. Working with
Ambassador Huebner to set up fund to help rebuild iconic church badly damaged in quake. Also promised NZ authorities
that we will provide relevant lessons learned from Haiti. I know how overwhelming ME issues are but small gestures and
steps in coming days will demonstrate our solidarity and cement new phase of our relationship. More soon Kurt
