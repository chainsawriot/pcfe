Josh:
  Thanks for sending the Secretary's speech to me. It is really very good. I have no substantive comments. It will be
very well received and it will follow very nicely my preceding plenary speech in which I speak about the scientific basis
for the implementation of the interventions to which she refers in her speech.
Best regards,
Tony

Subject: RE: Updated: S's IAS speech

Here's the latest version, reflecting our discussion with S yesterday. I'll incorporate as many of your comments as I can
before sending it to her at noon ET tomorrow (Saturday). But I'll still be able to take edits after that too.

 I'll also send this to the WH, USAID, and Tony Fauci.

Here's the version I put in S's book tonight and the one we'll be discussing tomorrow.

I'll send mail on the sex worker/people in prostitution issue to a smaller group.

Thanks all.
