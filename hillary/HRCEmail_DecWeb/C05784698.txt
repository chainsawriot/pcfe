Subject: Update on Wounded Warrior project -- Tuesday, October 25


Today's update:

•         OSD staff confirmed today that they do not plan to formally respond to our request to deploy
a hospital ship to Libya citing cost (est. $20M/month), time (25-30 days to move on station), and the
inappropriateness of the ship to meet Libya's current medical needs.

          DOD will keep the ship option "on the table" should the situation in Libya make it a more
appropriate response.

•          Embassy-Tripoli continues to advise against the deployment of DOD field hospitals for 4
reasons: 1) Ministry of Health confirmed they have an adequate number of field hospitals staffed by
International Medical Corps and others; 2) Libyan sensitivities to the presence of foreign troops; 3)
the declining need for immediate emergency trauma response, and 4) the fighters' expectation that
they will receive special treatment outside of Libya as a reward for their sacrifice. The TNC is under
enormous pressure to meet this expectation.

-   Embassy Tripoli is also working on the payment arrangement for medical costs using Libyan
funds in the Temporary Financial Mechanism.

•          However, Embassy Tripoli notes the possibility that after the immediate and high profile
MEDEVAC support, the Libyan authorities will need assistance in developing longer-term
rehabilitative and mental health care for their war-wounded. DOD may be able to provide this
assistance in Libya.

•       OSD is working earnestly to respond positively to our request to provide MEDEVAC airlift to
move Libyan wounded to both the U.S. and Europe.

         Initial flight being planned for as early as Thursday would include 20-25 ambulatory
wounded for transport to Spalding Rehabilitative Hospital in Boston, MA.

            Post has provided passport information to CA to expedite entry into the US.

           Possible second flight may transport 6 unstable, seriously wounded to hospitals in Europe.
This flight will require a specialized aircraft.

           Embassy-Tripoli is making significant progress in organizing first cohort of patients for these
two flights.

             DOD is tentatively planning to use what remains of the Presidential Drawdown Authority
(about $8 million) to fund this flight and possibly others. We are still working within State to determine
if this is the right use of this resource.

                             --DOD would require the stationing of six additional personnel on the
                             ground in Tripoli to assist with these flights.

-     NEA and EUR are working to identify European partner nations that would be willing to receive
airlifted patients.
