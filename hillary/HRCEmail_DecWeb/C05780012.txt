STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON



It is with great regret that I announce that Ambassador Pascual has asked President Obama and me to accept his
resignation as our ambassador to Mexico

For the past year and a half, Ambassador Pascual has been an architect and advocate for the U.S.-Mexico relationship,
effectively advancing the policies of the United States on behalf of the President and this Administration. He has
collaborated tirelessly with his Mexican counterparts to lay the foundation for a cross-border renewable energy market,
to open negotiations on the management of oil and gas reserves that span U.S. and Mexican territory, and to build a
new border strategy to advance trade while staunching illicit flows. Carlos has also engaged U.S. and Mexican business
to build markets that have helped make Mexico the number two destination of U.S. exports.

Ambassador Pascual worked with the Mexican government to integrate human rights into our respective policies and
engagement; he also partnered to enhance the human and cultural connections that underpin the friendship between
the people of Mexico and the United States. Carlos partnered with his counterparts to reach beyond the Merida
Initiative's initial focus on disrupting cartels to building institutions for the rule of law in Mexico and engaging Mexican
civil society in advancing their security. These ties, grown and strengthened throughout his tenure, will serve both our
nations for decades.

Within the U.S. Government, Carlos embraced a "whole of government" approach to addressing one of our most
important bilateral relationships, winning the respect and cooperation of our foreign service, military and law

enforcement agencies. The President and I are particularly grateful to Carlos for his efforts to sustain the morale and
security of American personnel after tragic shootings in Mexico that killed four people from our extended family in the
past year.

Carlos has relayed his decision to return to Washington based upon his personal desire to ensure the strong relationship
between our two countries and to avert issues raised by President Calderon that could distract from the important
business of advancing our bilateral interests. It is with great reluctance that President Obama and I have acceded to
Carlos's request. Prior to returning to assuming his new responsibilities at the State Department, the President and I
have asked Carlos to stay in Mexico to help us organize an orderly transition.

Or just:

 We cannot speak for President Calderon. Ambassador Pascual decided to resign as ambassador to ensure the
continuance of strong relationship between the United States and Mexico, as well as the ability for our countries to
focus on the most important aspects of our bilateral relationship without distraction.
