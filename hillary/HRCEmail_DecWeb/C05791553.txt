Subject: Potential agenda items for Jim Kim meeting tomorrow

Hi Cheryl,

Find attached and below a set of potential items for the Jim Kim lunch tomorrow. I'm going into meeting with Jose
Fernandez now, but will be free after 5.30pm or this evening if it's useful to talk through.

I also just got a call to review the BCL for a lunch with Jim Kim that Tom Nides is attending at Tim Geithner's invitation. I
am going to review at 5.30pm, but from the review of the previous BCL I am guessing it may miss some key issues (but it
will be too late to really add/change anything). Would it make sense to share something with Tom after you and the
Secretary meet with Jim?

Thanks, Daniella
