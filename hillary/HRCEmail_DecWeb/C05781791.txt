Subject: AG APPEAL DECISION

Just to let you know that CUBINT Charge Carlos Barros just visited to let us know that the Cuban court
will be announcing the appeal decision shortly: decision upheld, sentence upheld. Surprise,
surprise. I told him we were disappointed, and again called for them to release Gross. Same
message was delivered to USINT in Havana. Our PA folks are crafting press guidance right now - if
there's anything in particular you think needs to be said, please let me know. Thanks, P-
