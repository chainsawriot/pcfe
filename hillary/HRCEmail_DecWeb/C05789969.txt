This is encouraging. We are laying the groundwork for a US-China-India trilat.

Subject: US/India/China Trialogue - UPDATE

Jake/Dan: as you may already have heard directly from Martin, he's been in Beijing for the past couple of days
and, among other things, has provisionally come to terms with the presidents of our two think tank partners-
Cui Liru of CICIR and Pratap Mehta of CPRâ€”on holding the first trialogue in Beijing within the bracket of 7-9
May. Rather promisingly, VFM Cui Kai-ting told Martin and Ken Lieberthal that the Chinese side is positively
inclined to let the trialogue evolve from Track II into Track I. We've got more work to be done on modalities,
but I just wanted to be sure you'd gotten this encouraging word. When Martin's back in DC (he returns over
the weekend), we'll be in touch with you about how to coordinate between BI and S/P in preparing for the
meeting. Strobe
