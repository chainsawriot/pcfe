Hi Mike,
FM Lavrov asked HRC to support Russia's bid to host the G20 in 2013. She did not make any commitments. So I wanted
to see if you had a view. She may have one as well, but as of yet I am not aware of them. I will ask her on the plane to
Istanbul tomorrow. If you have any thoughts to pass on to her, please let me know.
Thanks,
Bob
