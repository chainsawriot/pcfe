Dear George:
     Simply put, I am sorry to see you go. I have the deepest respect, admiration and gratitude for the service you
provided our country as Special Envoy for Middle East Peace — not to mention the rest of your incredible career.
applaud your tireless efforts to advance our shared vision of a comprehensive peace between Israelis and Palestinians
and Israel and all of its Arab neighbors.

I had the privilege of seeing up close the unique combination of diplomatic insight and political pragmatism you brought
to this most complex of foreign policy challenges.

 The differences between the parties — as you have often noted — are deep and serious, requiring time and good faith
negotiations to overcome. While we have not yet achieved our goal, your work was a vital contribution to the
framework of a peace agreement that will one day emerge. And as we build on your work, all of us will heed your call to
remain patient and persistent in the pursuit of peace.

Your service was in the highest tradition of our country, and provided an example of integrity and honor for all of
us. You represent the finest of American statesmanship and diplomacy. All of us at the State Department will miss your
steady leadership and wise counsel, but I know you will remain a passionate advocate for peace and I look forward to
drawing on your advice and insights as we proceed.
