Cheryl: Immediately after last                  I prepared an email on the high side and sent it to Bill Burns. I tried
(unsuccessfully) through the Op Center to reach you to share             Dutcome. Bill Burns on Friday morning said he had
reached you and the Secretary. I will ask Don Yamamoto to send you a copy asap of what I sent Bill last week. It outlines
the tone and direction of the meeting. It can be sent on the low side. Johnnie. DON and DANTE: could you send asap a
copy of my                                   readout to Cheryl. I copied both of you. Its on the       side, but can be
shifted to the low. Thanks.
