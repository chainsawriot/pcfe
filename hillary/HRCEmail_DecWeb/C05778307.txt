I did not get the earlier email - tho they told me they had fixed the problem.

Ron just called Jonathan and asked us to delay a couple days past Sunday because of the fires. We haven't responded
but under the circumstances hard to say no.

                                                                                                                             B5




I will get you all of the material tomorrow.

Thx. I want to see the scripts for MEPP since I remain concerned that we risk looking irrelevant at best. So let's be sure
we know what are the pros and cons of any way forward. Also, regarding the BN call, it is mostly for reason I told you,
but I need tps for other issues.
