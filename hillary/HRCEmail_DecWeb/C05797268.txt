Subject: Today's performance

Cheryl:
   Anyone who had any doubts about the Secretary's stamina and capability following her illness had those doubts
washed away by today's performance before the Senate and the House. She faced extremely difficult circumstances at
the Hearings and still she hit it right out of the park. Please tell her that we all love her and are very proud to know her.
Warm regards,
Tony
