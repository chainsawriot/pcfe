Cheryl, here is a Haitian media report on the French pledge to help train a border patrol. We have the French desk
looking to see if it was reported in the French press. I have also asked the Elizabeth Beton-Delegue, the French
equivalent of Roberta, to give me a call.

French Chancellor Alain Juppe, at a meeting in France with his Haitian counterpart Laurent Lamothe confirmed that
"France was ready to accompany Haiti in terms of formation of a Security Force." This would be a new military force
