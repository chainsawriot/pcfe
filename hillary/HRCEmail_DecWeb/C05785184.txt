Subject: What think of this?

Thank you Madame Secretary and thank you all for being here.

I, too, wish to express my gratitude for the time afforded to us by so many of Pakistan's leaders today.

Having been somewhat of a frequent flyer myself to these parts, I know and appreciate how tough it is' -- especially in
times like this -- to break away from the press of events to hold these sorts of discussions.

And, as the Secretary mentioned, they were very candid discussions -- the kind of discussions two friends should be able
to have at such a critical time.

I want to associate myself with everything the Secretary said about the criticality of this relationship and about moving it
forward in a positive direction, but in particular I want to echo her comments about the shared sense of urgency.

I think we all realize the challenges under which this relationship now labors.

But now is not the time for retreat or recrimination.

Now is the time for action and closer coordination .... for more cooperation, not less .... for the friendship to get
stronger, not weaker.

The killing of Osama bin Laden has accomplished many things -- many necessary things.

It has removed permanently the leader of an organization that is avowed to no other end than the killing of innocent
people.

It has sent that organization into some disarray and most likely disrupted some of its future plans.

It has called into question -- indeed it has proven false -- al Qaeda's claim and confidence in itself as untouchable or
omniscient .... just as events throughout the Arab world prove false al Qaeda's ideology of extremism and hate.

But bin Laden's death -- however welcome -- has NOT for the short term eliminated the threats we both face from
terrorism.

Recent attacks right here in Pakistan over the last few days serve as grim reminders of that fact ... and of the sacrifices
that the Pakistani people continue to pay at the hands of these criminals.

Nor has his death meant the death of al Qaeda altogether ... or of the alliances that have formed between al Qaeda and
elements of the Taliban.

We see that collusion persist.

We see the desire emerge for longevity and reorganization ... and perhaps even the desire for closer ties between
disparate groups of extremists.

To be sure, these groups are weaker, much weaker -- and not just as a result of this raid, but as a result of the
extraordinary efforts expended by both coalition forces and the Pakistani military over the last couple years.

There is a much larger struggle afoot, and I would be remiss if I did not applaud the bravery and the skill with which
Pakistani troops have engaged the enemy in that struggle, losing thousands of their number in the process.

But in their weakness and in their confusion, the terrorists are lashing out.

And so the fight must go on.

And it must go on with the Pakistani military and the U.S. military acting, coordinating and leading together.

We have come too far and sacrificed too much for it to be any other way, for EITHER of us.

This isn't America's war. This is Pakistan's war and Afghanistan's war. It's a regional war against a common enemy, a
war in which all of share a stake and all of us must hazard certain risks.

For our part, my military took many risks going after bin Laden ... risks to the lives of our men and women in uniform ...
risks to civilian casualties and to collateral damage.

We took the risk of being wrong about what we thought we knew of the killer's whereabouts.

And, yes, in our desire to preserve secrecy, we incurred a certain risk in our relationships with other nations in the
region.

But this particular relationship with Pakistan is too critical ... and now is too critical a time ... to allow whatever
differences we may still have with one another impede the progress we must still make together.

I harbor no allusions about the difficulties ahead, nor do I leave here misinformed about the trust which still needs to be
rebuilt between our two militaries.

But I do leave here with a sense that General Kayani and other Pakistani military leaders share my commitment to that
task and share my desire to look for ways to advance the relationship.

There's no better time for that sort of partnership than right now.

Thank you.
