Hi Jake,




We understand that tomorrow is LTG Dayton's last day in Jerusalem as head of USSC. I don't know if he's planning a
return trip through Washington, but Dennis thought it might be a nice gesture for him to receive a brief call or note of
thanks from the Secretary for his contribution to peace and security and his 40 years of service to the country.




Any chance that might be possible?




Thanks,

-Ben
