Subject: Moment w Lebanese school girls I had to share

Cheryl,

Am about to depart Beirut. Was in classroom yesterday in working cl town in southern Leb w classrm of 12 year old
girls. (We had done a bunch of much needed physical repair work at school.) Asked how many were going to university.
Almost every hand went up. Asked how many knew what they wanted to do after university. One after the other, they
started volunteering: doctor, graphic designer, journalist, teacher, media specialist, pilot. So I said that our boss,
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, would be so pleased to hear about all their future plans because it was so impt to her
that girls all over the world committed to their studies and like them, made plans for their futures and worked toward
them. Huge smiles in the rm. Then I added that Secretary Clinton also wanted to hear from all of us (I pointed at me +
our Amb + the various usg staff in the rm) what we were doing to help them achieve their goals. Even bigger grins.
Definitely one of the (too rare) purely fun moments in the job. So I thought you should know.
