Subject:                          RE: QFRs



Evening Madam Secretary: I apologize for the delay in responding. We received 526 QFRs from the 4 committees on a
rolling basis between March
5 and March 14. As of today we have sent 38 answers to the Committees.
We have an additional 140 answers in final clearance here in H which will go up this week. We believe we are on track
to have all of the QFRs answered within 30 days of receipt from the Committees, as you requested. My goal is to have
this process completed no later than April 14.


On Senator Corker, we reached out to his staff to get clarity on the information he was seeking regarding NNSA and have
a formal reply from AVC and the DoE pending here in H which will go up this week. Dave

How are we doing on answering the QFRs from my four appearances?


Did Dept of Energy respond to Corker's question about NNSA budget?
