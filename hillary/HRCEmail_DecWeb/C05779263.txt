I have just talked to post (Yael). She and Joan will work to reduce staff and send more out on ferry. Shd get down to 10-
12. She fully understands need for limited staff to stay to deal with community. Believes likely remainder will be position
to leave in few days. Says situation is "worse than Baghdad in 2004-2005 "

Folks, no one told us that this decision had been made. Did you know? See my note to Jake. I passed along your
requests to Joan. If we are suspending, I think its too late to get it all done by time ferry gets there. Janet

Jake, we weren't told that there was decision to suspend operations now. We are working with post to reduce staffing
down to critical levels to allow them to get the amcits on the ferry tomorrow and, over the next days, deal with the
remaining community. Jeff, Pat Kennedy and Steve Mull felt that we couldn't just plug the plug at this point but wd be
poised to do so shortly if that decision is made. If we need to suspend tomorrow, please let me know we will do our best
to move quickly. Janet
