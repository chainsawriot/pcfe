Subject: RE: Iraq SIGIR report

SIGIR gets some things wrong in its report on the Police Development Program in Iraq. For example, the $6.2 million per
trainer figure is inflated by the initial start-up costs. There are a lot of other "inaccuracies" and didn't incorporate many
of INL's suggestions. But SIGIR was correct on a number of points. INL made things worse by refusing to meet with SIGIR
initially -- at M's recommendation, based on questions about whether SIGIR had authority to investigate this sector.
Turns out they did, so they weren't well-disposed toward INL. They viewed INL's cooperation in providing documents
and information as insufficient. There are always two sides to that story.

I would say though that the PDP is an Achilles heel for us. There are many uncertainties surrounding it. There was no
baseline assessment done (either by DOD or by State) prior to the program. There is no implementing agreement with
the Iraqis. MOI's cooperation is not 100% (the ministry does not work with contractors on an assessment, preferring
official employees). There is no comprehensive plan. (What we shared with SIGIR is a plan —called Core Work
Requirements -- but not a comprehensive one. There had been an attempt to create a better plan, but it kept getting
outdated by the situation on the ground.) To some extent, INL is building this airplane while flying it.


The program costs $860 million, making it State's largest undertaking there. Amb. Michele Sison, formerly of Embassy
Beirut, is Assistant Ambassador for the PDP and rule of law programs.
