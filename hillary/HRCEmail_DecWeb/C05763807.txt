Secretary Clinton,

Thank you for your response, and very glad to hear that your elbow is on the mend.

On the Indian Ocean, moving faster than our normal bureaucratic pace on clearing the export of technologies to
India would seem to be in order,
                         We have discussed with Mr. Marshall the kinds of assessments that need to be done to
identify which technologies can be transferred even if there is a risk of their being compromised.

Another concrete measure would be for the United States to use our good offices to facilitate intra-regional
bilateral dialogues -- e.g., between India and Japan, or India and Australia, or Japan and ROK -- on issues of
common concern. We have been told by the Japanese and Indians that they are reluctant to undertake such
dialogues for fear of US opposition. If this is a sincere concern, it is an unfortunate misunderstanding that can
be easily clarified, and the US State Department could offer to create a venue for such meetings.

A few other ideas for the State Department might be more appropriate to discuss in person, and I'd be happy to
meet if you have a few minutes over the weekend. Also, with regard to your forthcoming sessions with
Treasury and the Chinese, it might make sense to brief you on some of our findings with regard to what we
believe to be the actual state of the Chinese economy and political economic issues in. China.

On the contract question, we are still working with Mr. Marshall to establish a vehicle that might allow us to do
work for Michele. When you next speak with her, if she mentions what she envisions for the start date, that
would be very helpful to know!

Thank you again, and all best, Jackie

 Jackie--

  Sorry this reply is so tardy but btw my elbow (which is improving) and India (where I am now), it's taken
 awhile!

  Thx for the analysis which raises concerns we have to address. I would welcome your ideas about how best to

do that. By the way, did the DOD contract work out?

 Hope you're well--H

Dear Secretary Clinton,

I hope that your elbow is healing quickly. I mentioned that we were
doing some work on maritime developments in the region from the
Persian Gulf to the East China Sea and Sea of Japan. Below are key
findings from the report, but the main takeaway is that the political
impact of Chinese military modernization may be greater than a narrow
technical analysis of China's capabilities would suggest, and for a
range of reasons, technical and political, prospects for regional
cooperation are limited, but pathways to conflict are numerous and
increasing.

All best, Jackie

Key findings from the workshop include:

•    Chinese naval modernization has proceeded at rates higher than
forecast 10 years ago and has created the capability to complicate
operation of US carrier battle groups within 1,000 kilometers of the
Chinese coastline.

•    The Indian Ocean may in the coming decades be the operating area of
SSBNs from countries with limited experience in sustained SSBN
patrols, including India, China, and possibly Pakistan.

•    Chinese maritime relations with countries along the littoral area
have continued to develop, with a new friendly relationship emerging
with Sri Lanka, to complement the existing relations with Myanmar and
Pakistan. This may lead to a new form of "blue-brown water" naval
operations, in which Chinese naval forces operate far from Chinese
bases, but close to the coasts of client states.

The workshop tended to the conclusion that the trends in the region
were not such as to make maritime cooperation easy. These trends
include:

•    Japanese concern that Chinese dominance in the waters within 1,000
miles of Chinese territory has immediate consequences for Japan's
maritime autonomy.

•   Indian suspicion of Chinese naval developments in Hainan Island,
Chinese development of port infrastructure in Pakistan and Myanmar,

and the possibility of Chinese ballistic missile submarines operating
close to India.

•     Indian interest in SSBNs, plus Chinese SSBN ports in Haitian and
even, possibly, Pakistani SSBNs, all of which creates the possibility
of multiple SSBN patrols in the Indian Ocean, along with the potential
for naval nuclear accidents at sea.

•    Asymmetries in levels of operational competence, and technology, in
submarines and maritime aviation, which, for example, make functional
multi-national naval cooperation harder for states that are afraid of
revealing technologies or weaknesses.

•     The major role of land-based maritime warfare strike complexes in
this region, which means that war at sea always carries with it the
risk of escalation to strikes on ground targets in homeland areas.

The report also offers two scenarios under which the United States may
consider engaging militarily in the region.
The first scenario, which concerns a clash between Japan and China in
waters claimed by both, compels us to consider:

•     The circumstances under which the Chinese may seek to demonstrate
that their new maritime capabilities must be taken seriously and
respected, and

•    What the United States would lose if it did not support the
Japanese, and then faced a world in which Japan became either a
subordinate power to China or a nuclear armed state, capable of
pursuing its national interest independent of the United States.

The second scenario concerns an American naval blockade of an Iran
that has tested a nuclear weapon, potentially giving rise to an
interaction between the United States and China far from the operating
bases of each but close to territory of a client of China, a
"blue-brown water" clash. In this scenario, China is using its navy
to show presence, and to force the United States to ask itself whether
it wants to go to war with China over a political conflict that is
less than black and white. Thinking about the options that would be
left to the United States under these circumstances underscores how
Chinese naval forces may have more political impact by 2025 than a
narrow assessment of their military capabilities would suggest.

> Dear Secretary Clinton,

> I was heartened to read your forceful remarks about the US commitment to the Asia-Pacific region this
morning. On Monday, our office held a workshop for the NIC that highlighted the downsides associated with
an American withdrawal from the region. I will be providing you with our report from that event. Also, in
early June, we are holding two workshops with US policy makers (one for Democrats and one for
Republicans) to illuminate how contingencies in Pakistan might affect US-China relations. I will give you a
read out on those events as well.

> Anne-Marie was in touch last evening to tell me that she had looked into the possibility of working with
LTSG and found that unfortunately her office would not be able to do so. Happily, Michele Flournoy's office
is reaching out and has asked me to participate in a wargame next week for the QDR, which I hope will help
build the foundation for a contract between her office and LTSG.

> I am extremely grateful to you for helping me find opportunities to serve our government. As ever, I will
keep you posted. Thank you again, and yrs, Jackie
