      Statement by the Press Secretary on the President's Call to President-elect Hollande of France

President Obama called President-elect Francois Hollande of France to congratulate him after the
results of the French election were announced today. President Obama indicated that he looks
forward to working closely with Mr. Hollande and his government on a range of shared economic
and security challenges. President Obama noted that he will welcome President-elect Hollande to
Camp David for the G-8 Summit and to Chicago for the NATO Summit later this month, and
proposed that they meet beforehand at the White House. President Obama and President-elect
Hollande each reaffirmed the important and enduring alliance between the people of the United
States and France.
