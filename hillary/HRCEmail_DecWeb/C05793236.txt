Thanks very much Bill. Just spoke with Pat and likely would be as many as 50. Some possibility of a smaller contingent
from another sector of military that would be about 16. Agree, would be temporary and as discreet as possible.

Just spoke to FM Amr on behalf of S. and urged that he and President Morsi weigh in with Sudanese tonight re
protective personnel to Khartoum. I mentioned that Anne had already been in touch with Essam Haddad.

Amr said he understood urgency, and would talk to Morsi and then raise with Bashir and co. I told him I did not have
precise numbers, but point was that addl personnel would be discreet and temporary, much as had been case in Cairo
during revolution. Key is to ensure safety of our diplomats.

He promised to try.

I explained the situation to Morsi's foreign policy advisor, Essam Haddad. Bashir is still in town, and there is a dinner
tonight. He said he would talk to President Morsi. He asked me how many people, and I replied that when they were
deployed to Egypt during the revolution, it was about forty marines.

S may want to call Amr, who I suspect will most likely see Bashir tonight and can be counted on to support the
request.
