Cheryl,

Just a note regarding the Secretary's mention this afternoon of the new Consular Adjudicators program as one of several
experiments to address pressing issues.

                  begins training next Monday at FSI to be a Consular Adjudicator in China. He is very enthusiastic
about the opportunity, and is in touch via an on-line forum with others entering the same class who are just as
enthused. Kudos to whomever came up with the idea, which I think will turn out to be a great way to quickly address
the consular workload in China.

Jonathan
