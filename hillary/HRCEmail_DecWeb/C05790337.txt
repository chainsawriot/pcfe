Thank you so much. It's been an honor. In addition to being grateful for the chance to be a small part of the amazing
work you've done through the Senate and internationally, I'm also grateful to have learned from you how to be effective
and the right way to treat people. My father once said to me that I was fortunate to have started working for you so
soon after graduating college because it set a high bar for excellence that I would take with me throughout my career,
and he's right. Rubenstein is hiring me because of that work ethic you taught me.

I'm very excited to be back in NY, and will make sure to get it ready for your return :). If there is anything I can ever do to
be helpful to you, please don't hesitate to let me know. I want to be a resource whenever needed!

My last day at USAID will be June 15. My cell will remain the same                     and I've copied my                 on
this email (christinefalvo

Thank you again for all your support throughout the years,
Chris

Dear Chris,

I just heard the good news about your new job w Rubenstein and am so happy for you. I'm also grateful for your service
and support at State and USAID. And, of course, I'm a little jealous that you'll be back in NY before me!

Please stay in touch w me and send me your new contact info when you're settled. All the best, my friend---H
