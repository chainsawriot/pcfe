1. Decision came back on Bill related hold matter last night around 8pm.

2.              and then jointly w/ leg teams, discussed what is acceptable language you can use to respond request,
which will require more discussion and legwork this am.

3. We will give you points and background (and make sure you have full info and clarity of language in it)

4. We are aiming to have materials by am, but I suspect it will take longer.

5. Will then make sure we talk all through w/ you w/ paper so you can ask any ques b/f placing call.
