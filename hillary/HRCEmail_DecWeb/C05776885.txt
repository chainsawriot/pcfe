Andrea--

  I am delighted to hear from you and very excited to know that you'll be at the White House making the case for health
care. They need your help and they couldn't have anyone better prepared to help explain the substance and guide the
politics.

 Good luck--enjoy the experience--and pls stay in touch. H

Madame Secretary,




I wanted to drop you a note to tell you that I have been detailed from HHS over to the White House Domestic Policy
Council. Today's my first day, so needless to say I am still trying to find my way around and get my hands on a
blackberry, but it's a great opportunity and it should be an equally excellent adventure. I'll be working on health reform
implementation and a range of public health issues.




Hope you are well. Please let me know if you need anything.




Best,

Andrea
