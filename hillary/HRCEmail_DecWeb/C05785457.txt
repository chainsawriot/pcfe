Subject: Update on Honduras and the OAS

The following is an update on our efforts to promote the prompt reintegration of Honduras
into the OAS. Attached, please find the current vote count (also listed below). Outreach
continued today, including calls between DAS Reynoso and ministers of Grenada, Dominica
and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and contacts at the OAS by Ambassador Lomellin.
As A/S Valenzuela discussed in a conference call earlier today, we are still hoping the
Colombian-Venezuelan effort will bring near consensus on this issue. If it does not, however,
the Colombians are supportive of the U.S. government desire for a prompt OAS vote.

Vote count

For reintegration (22): United States; Canada; Mexico; Chile; Peru; Colombia; Panama;
Costa Rica; El Salvador; Guatemala; Belize; Haiti; Dominican Republic; Jamaica; Barbados;
Trinidad and Tobago; Bahamas; Saint Lucia; Grenada; Antigua and Barbuda; Guyana; Saint
Kitts and Nevis

Against (8): Venezuela; Bolivia; Ecuador; Nicaragua; Brazil; Argentina; Uruguay; Paraguay

Undecided (3): Dominica; Suriname; Saint Vincent and the Grenadines

  • Pres. Colom phoned Pres. Ortega. Ortega did not/not push back on reintegration.
  • DAS Reynoso called PM Skerrit (Dominica). He said the Honduras issue would come up
    next week at the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States meeting. He said Dominica
    would support reintegration once "Zelaya is free to go home."
  • DAS Reynoso called the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines PM.
  • Amb. Aponte asked Pres. Funes to call Pres. Rousseff.
  • Amb. McKinley asked Pres. Santos to call Rousseff.
  • Amb. Piehel called the Suriname FM. Suriname thinks it's "time to move forward."
  • Amb. Lomellin spoke with Colombian OAS Perm. Rep. Hoyos. He said Colombia is
    going to try to lobby Argentina.
  • Amb. Lomellin spoke with the Belizeans, Guatemalans and Peruvians at the OAS. Pres.
    Colom hod planned to call FM Patriota (Brazil) to ask him not to hinder Honduras's
    reentrance. Patriota said Argentina is concerned about human rights issues. Peruvian
    Perm. Rep. DeZela said he has spoken to Venezuelan Perm. Rep. Chaderton.
    Chaderton said Venezuela would not obstruct the reintegration process.

Opportunities

   • Pres. Colom will call Pres. Rousseff to emphasize the implications of Honduras's isolation
     to its region in light of the deteriorating security situation. Colom is also willing to travel
     to Brazil to convey that message.
         o DAS Reynoso is calling FM Rodas (Guatemala) this weekend to urge continued
             Guatemalan outreach to Brazil.
   • Pres. Fernandez is also reaching out to Pres. Rousseff.

     Choquehuanca (Bolivia). A/S Valenzuela will also meet with Pres. Mujica at the
     Paraguayan bicentennial events.
   • FM Holguin (Colombia) was in Argentina on May 13, and will be in Uruguay on May 14
     pushing Honduran reintegration.
   • Embassy Brasilia is working to persuade the Brazilians that the Zelaya case will not/not
     be appealed.
   • Possible WH call to Brazil.
   • Possible S call to Santos.

Benjamin
