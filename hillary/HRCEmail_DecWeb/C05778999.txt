I saw their email to Cheryl. What they are calling a "tick tock" is the Cooper/Landler story we've been discussing that's
on the front page of today's paper. There isn't a story separate from that.


But in Politico, there's the following account:

LIVING HISTORY, BEHIND THE CURTAIN -- What the White House was hearing and thinking as iViubarak signaled he
would go, then stayed, then went -- As told by a senior administration official: "Everyone we talked to in the Egyptian
government anticipated Mubarak would make, certainly, a more definite statement than he ended up making [Thursday
night]. Depending on who you talked to in the government, you could get a slightly different take on what people
anticipated -- whether he was resigning, or being more definitive in transferring power to his vice president. But they all
thought he would do something definitive. IVIubarak did not do that. My personal read on it is that they — repeatedly,
throughout this period —tried to do things to mollify the protesters and make them go away: announcing he wouldn't
run again, announcing a diaidgue, announcing the steps they.were going to take."Each time, they DRAMATICALLY
UNDERSHOT WHAT WAS GOING TO BE SATISFACTORY TO THE PROTESTERS. Each time, the protests.only grew. This was
the final instance of him saying something so unacceptable to the people in the streets. it became an almost irreversible
momentum toward him having to resign. If there was any doubt before he spoke, the reaction in the streets made it
clear you would have a very unstable situation Friday.... Through all this, the miiitary preserved some independence and
stature with the Egyptian people, separate and apart from Mubarak. They already had refused to engage in a
crackdown, and THAT IN ITSELF WAS A SIGNAL TO MUBARAK THAT THERE WAS NO PUTTING THIS BACK IN THE BOX by
force. You couldn't stop the momentum in the street."None of the worst-case scenarios occurred: "The worst day was
with the horses and plainclothes thugs. Imagine if that had been tanks and bullets. We never saw that. A guy who'd
been in power for 30 years relinquished power, without mass bloodshed in the streets. Other scenarios would have
involved a really massive government crackdown — soldiers shooting on the people. Even with the repressive tactics we
saw, we never saw a Tiananmen-type situation.... The protesters, themselves, remained peaceful. You didn't see them
storming government buildings, burning down government buildings. The protest proceeded peacefully. So despite all
this tension, the fact that we ended up with an outcome where he steps aside — relinquishes power, enables this
democratic transition to begin, without broad violence. — is a pretty remarkable thing, and would have been hard to
predict. It would have been seen as a VERY optimistic scenario two weeks ago."The next phase will play out over
MONTHS: "We see this as a moment of great opportunity. [We're] optimistic, because of the way the Egyptian people
have acted for democracy, though [we're] mindful that there will be challenges and difficult days."

My understanding is that the NYT is running a tick tock tomorrow, it was alluded to in Politico which is where they likely
saw it

Did the WH release a timeline of events to the Times? Cheryl heard about it from Neera and John but we haven't seen it.
Have you?
