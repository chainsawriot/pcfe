Subject:                           Thank you!



You were marvelous and the women love you. I heard it over and over. They we're frustrated that they were told they
had to be quiet when you came in the room. They finally couldn't stand it any more and started to sing. So glad you
joined them and calmed down the FL!
AWEP has become a great success. You should have heard the Zambian trade minister today tell them he'll do anything
they want. I told them to hold him to it!

I visited some great projects in Zambia, good people but lots of challenges. Violence vs women and girls is a big
problem, HIV/AID still high and more.
Slowly, I think it's changing for the better.

I'm about to board and really sorry I had to leave. The calendar rules my life!
Have a good trip.
