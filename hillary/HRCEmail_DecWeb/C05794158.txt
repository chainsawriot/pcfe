I had no idea she was having this delay. By the time she gets here,                            Can she help us on
other projects afterwards?

                   still has not cleared L/Ethics.




                    already has her DS clearance, ID badge and email address. So we are ready to go as
          soon as they clear her.



          Katy/Rich are aware this is a priority for us to move but having difficulty getting the General
          Counsel to respond. I have reached out to             to make sure she is aware of hold up and
          can help push this.



          Thx

   L/Ethics is still reviewing. They are aiming to have the clearance completed end of this
   week/early next week, but understand her form is complicated and L did not have the position
   description to review it against until last week.



   In the meantime,          is coming in for a security briefing on Wednesday and asked if she
   could get any briefing materials to bring her up to speed. I reached out to Kamala on this.



   Thx
