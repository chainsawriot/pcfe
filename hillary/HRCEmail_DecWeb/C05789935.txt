I've been speaking to Heather Samuelson                            Thanks for thinking of me. I would love to
take it on since I know you and I share the same vision for what that organization should be doing.

Heather and I are trying to work our ways through those and I will keep you and Cheryl posted. It really
shouldn't be so hard to serve our country!!!
