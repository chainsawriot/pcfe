STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
Deteriorating Human Rights Situation in Iran

The United States remains deeply concerned by the persecution of Iranian citizens at the hand of their government.
Over the past ten days, we have witnessed the bravery of thousands of Iranians who once again took to the streets to
exercise their fundamental rights to peaceful assembly and expression. It has been made clear to the world that Iran
denies its citizens the same fundamental rights it continues to applaud elsewhere in the Middle East.

Security forces have beaten, detained, and - in at least three cases - killed peaceful protesters. Off the streets, the
regime's leaders have targeted human rights defenders and political activists, and authorities have recently rounded-up
ex-government officials and their families; former members of parliament; clerics and their children; student leaders and
their professors; as well as journalists and bioggers. They also continue to deny their citizens access to information by
jamming satellite transmissions and blocking internet sites.

Iran's leaders also continue to persecute ethnic and religious minorities. We are troubled by reports that, of the dozens
of prisoners executed in 2011, most are ethnic minorities. At the same time, Baha'is and other religious minorities
continue to be subjected to arbitrary arrests and prosecutions, harsh sentences, and unsafe prison conditions. We call
on Iran to free all political prisoners and persecuted minorities.

The steady deterioration in human rights conditions in Iran has obliged the international community to speak out time
and again. Today, the United States sanctions two Iranian officials - in addition to the eight sanctioned by the President
last fall - for perpetrating these abuses. The world will continue to watch and will hold accountable those responsible for
these actions. The United States joins the international community in affirming the universal rights to which all men and
women - in Iran and around the world - are entitled. ###

       Departments of the Treasury and State Announce Designations of Tehran Prosecutor General, Basij
                                Commander for Human Rights Abuses in Iran

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Departments of the Treasury and State today announced the designation of two
Iranian officials, Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi, Tehran Prosecutor General, and Mohammed Reza Naqdi, commander
of the IRGC's Basij Forces, for being responsible for or complicit in serious human rights abuses in Iran since
the June 2009 disputed presidential election.

Today's action was taken pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13553, signed by President Obama in September
2010, to provide the United States with new tools to target human rights abuses engaged in by officials by the
Government of Iran. As a result of today's action, any property in the United States or in the possession or

control of U.S. persons in which the designees have an interest is blocked, and U.S. persons are prohibited from
engaging in transactions with them. The designees are also subject to visa sanctions by the Department of
State.

"Today's designations highlight the complicity of two Iranian officials in significant human right abuses against
the Iranian people," said OFAC Director Adam J. Szubin. "Dolatabadi and Naqdi have no place in the
international financial system."

State Department Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor Michael Posner added,
"Today's action underscores our enduring commitment to support Iranians seeking to exercise their universal
rights and expresses our solidarity with victims of torture, persecution, and arbitrary detention."

Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi
Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi was appointed as Tehran Prosecutor General in August 2009. Since his appointment,
Dolatabadi's office has indicted a large number of protesters, including individuals who took part in the
December 2009 Ashura Day protests, which saw large scale clashes between demonstrators and security forces
resulting in deaths and severe injuries. His office has charged protesters with the charge of Muharebeh, or
enmity against God, which carries a death sentence, and denied due process to those facing the death
sentence. His office has also targeted and arrested reformists, human rights activists, and members of the
media, as part of a broad crackdown on the political opposition.

Some of the defendants were tried at Evin court, which had been recently created within the confines of the
notorious Evin prison and whose creation Dolatabadi defended in March 2010. In Evin prison, some of the
defendants were held in solitary confinement, abused, and coerced into making false self-incriminating
statements.

President Obama identified Dolatabadi's predecessor, Saeed Mortazavi, for sanctions under E.O. 13553 by
listing him in the Annex to the Order.

Mohammed Reza Naqdi
As commander of the IRGC's Basij Forces, Naqdi was responsible for or complicit in Basij abuses occurring in
late 2009, including the violent response to the December 2009 Ashura Day protests, which resulted in up to 15
deaths and the arrests of hundreds of protesters.

Prior to his appointment as commander of the Basij in October 2009, Naqdi was the head of the intelligence unit
of the Basij responsible for interrogating those arrested during the post-election crackdown and was in charge of
an interrogation team at the Kahrizak.detention center. Naqdi extracted forced confessions from high-ranking
reformist leaders that were broadcast on Iranian state-run television. At least three demonstrators are reported
to have died as a result of injuries sustained at the Kahrizak detention center.
