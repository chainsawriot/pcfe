Subject: re your interview w/ Mark Landler tmw: his conversation with David Rothkopf

David Rothkopf called me earlier today to give me a heads up on his conversation w/ Landler and how he framed some
of the issues Landler wants to explore in a way that apparently resonated. Given how well David keys into what we are
trying to do, I thought you should see the summary of the conversation — I have also sent this to Philippe and Jake.




Landler wants to use your career as a window onto the evolution of our foreign policy —e .g. your appreciation of
development issues early; your realization of the limits of force through your experience w/ Iraq war as a Senator; your
emphasis on human rights early. David's framing was: "we're in a new era, with a balance of power emerging among
roughly 15 important countries in the world; and in that world diplomacy is absolutely central to America's ability to
lead — we need to build and manage relationships with those countries, put together shifting coalitions, broker
agreements — the stuff of diplomacy." Landler reportedly said: "Oh, that sounds like the CFR speech." (remember, he
mostly reported on how the speech was your effort to get back into the game after breaking your elbow). And on that
note, Landler said "everything we hear says that the WH dictates policy" — Rothkopf said that perhaps the WH drew up
the menu, but State prepares the meal, organizes the dinner, conducts the conversation, manages the relationships.
Other agencies have important roles to play, but we manage the overall framework within which we can get things
done. That apparently resonated w/ Landler as well.




I think this is                                                                                                   I also   B5
