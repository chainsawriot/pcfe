Just finished dinner with the
African women entrepreneurs we brought to DC last AGOA. Tell HRC, they've decided to follow Zambia's lead and
establish AWEP chapters in ALL their countries! The Zambian is so impressive and has had AWEP all over the news that
the President of Zambia inquired about AWEP and just named her a commissioner on an economics related commission.
Her name is Sylvia Banda.

As you may have heard from Mike, the FL couldn't cope with the prospect of no podium so we're accommodating her.
HRC can use it or use hand mike. The women are beside themselves with expectation!

Safe travels!
