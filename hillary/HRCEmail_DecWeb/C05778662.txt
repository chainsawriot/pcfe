             he thought the Times had an editor who was driving this

What is the angle as you understand it--is this a State-WH rift story? A POTUS-S rift? There's more (and less) than meets

Just talked to Karen DeYoung who is trying to get story right. She asked REALLY hard questions.

Landler said his editors are amending his story but not in a good way. We'll see.

Talked        who is also working the phones.

We'll see how this goes.
