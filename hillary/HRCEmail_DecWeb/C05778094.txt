Some background to the below:

- De Mistura met with international Ambos and some MPs early today. KE used our guidance. Emphasis was on need to
find resolution.
- Large group of MPs, possibly well over 200 but difficult to estimate, met with Karzai. Reportedly some heated
exchanges.
- Group was then reduced to 34 MPs (one from each province) plus IEC and ECC plus Supreme Court rep, meeting with
Karzai. Latest proposal emerged from that.
- Separately, de Mistura also met with Karzai, showed him the statement that wasn't released and the one that was. No
further readout.

From our UNAMA colleagues:

The MPs have agreed to a delay of inauguration until Wednesday on the condition that the Special
Court is abolished and only the Supreme Court handles individual criminal cases. They have given
the President until 10am Sunday to respond in a public manner. If there is a negative response,
they'll convene the Parliament tomorrow afternoon at 4pm.

More to follow our Sunday      morning when we make contact with the key MPs.

Karl

Wednesday, if not- tommorow afternoon. MPs will meet again tommorow at 9am at Interconcinental.
Quanooni very thankful to IC and in particular Hillary Clinton for their firm stand.
3rd point on Special Court was not agreed with President and was added by MPs.
I welcomed the emerging deal and we both agreed to stay in close touch.
