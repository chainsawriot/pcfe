Subject: Quick question On President Clinton

Hi Cheryl,

As you know we are putting the "Frontiers in Development" conference June 11-13. We are hoping the Secretary will
provide the opening address or otherwise will be involved in some major way. I know that is not yet certain, but we
hope so!

We'd like to invite President Clinton to participate on the third day (Wed June 13) as part of a half-day set of sessions on
"Engaging the American Public on Development." We hope to involve members of Congress, Secretary Powell, Bono,
Nick Kristoff, Bill Gates, and others during the half day. I just want to check from your perspective on whether it would
be OK to invite President Clinton. Of course we will also check with the WH but I wanted to give you a head's up and
check with you first.

We're slowly, slowly trying to turn this agency around....

Thanks,
Steve
