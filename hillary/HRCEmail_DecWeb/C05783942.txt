See below from MFA press conference today. Wen Jibao went to Brunei â€” the first for a Chinese Premier.

11. Premier Wen's visit to Brunei - the first by a Chinese Premier - would
strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation and deepen bilateral cooperation in
energy, health, education, agriculture, economics and culture, Liu said. China.
and Brunei did not have any disputes; bilateral relations were developing
well. During the visit, energy companies from the two countries would sign a
cooperative agreement on energy. Brunei was an energy exporter and China was an
energy importer, so bilateral energy cooperation was very normal, Liu said.
