Subject: Wide praise for Secretary Clinton's remarks today - set up for World AIDS Day and the President

Colleagues,

People throughout the community are enthusiastically praising Secretary Clinton's speech on global AIDS today (amfAR's
press release is below).

The Secretary's announcement that "creating an AIDS free generation has never been a policy priority for the United
States government — until today," has raised our hearts, our hopes and our expectations. The news, contained in her
speech today, that the PEPFAR cost of AIDS treatment fell 24% in the last year makes it clear that much bolder
treatment targets are achievable. As you know, advocates are united in calling for six million people on AIDS treatment
by 2013 through PEPFAR as part of a combination prevention strategy.

I urge you to build on the Secretary's remarks and plan for an announcement by President Obama on World AIDS Day
that lays out how the US government will take advantage of this opportunity.

Please let me know how we can help.

Chris

                         amfAR Applauds Remarks on U.S. Global AIDS Leadership from
                                      Secretary of State Hillary Clinton

                              Secretary announces PEPFAR treatment costs fall by 24%

                        Foundation calls for Administration to act decisively on recent scientific
                                     breakthroughs to begin to end the epidemic

NEW YORK, November 8, 2011—ainfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research, welcomed remarks delivered
Tuesday by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton that reinforced the role of American leadership in the
global response to HIV/AIDS, and urged the Obama Administration to implement policies that could begin to
end the worldwide AIDS epidemic.

Secretary Clinton delivered her remarks at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) amid increasing enthusiasm
in the scientific community that accelerated progress in reducing HIV incidence and mortality is within our
reach. In July, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease at the
NIH, wrote in the journal Science that "...we now have the unprecedented opportunity, based on solid scientific
data, to control and ultimately end the AIDS epidemic."

"Our efforts have helped set the stage for the historic opportunity the world has today: To change the course of
this pandemic and usher in an AIDS-free generation," Clinton said. She also announced that PEPFAR
(President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) treatment costs have fallen to $335 per patient, including ARVs
and services—a 24% decrease just in the last year. Additionally, Clinton announced an initiative to scale up
combination prevention, including treatment, in four countries, and challenged other donors to join us in the
effort to "defeat AIDS."

During the past 18 months, several major research studies have shown the potential to make great strides against
the global epidemic, including the use of voluntary medical male circumcision to reduce HIV incidence and
earlier initiation of AIDS treatment to reduce the likelihood of one partner passing HIV to another. Other recent
studies have demonstrated the efficacy of using vaginal microbicides to prevent infection in women, and pre-
exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in both heterosexual and homosexual populations. These approaches, combined
with behavioral interventions, condom access, prevention of mother-to-child transmission, syringe exchange
programs, and other initiatives present the opportunity to make real progress against the epidemic, said amfAR
CEO Kevin Robert Frost.

"Right now, we have an unprecedented opportunity to make dramatic progress in response to AIDS around the
world," Frost said. "If we invest strategically now and continue to fund cutting-edge research, we can alter the
trajectory of the epidemic and accelerate progress toward a vaccine and, ultimately, a cure. Beginning to end
AIDS could be the legacy of our generation."

"Secretary Clinton today outlined the tremendous opportunity at hand," said amfAR Vice President and
Director of Public Policy Chris Collins. "We applaud the Secretary's leadership on global AIDS and her vision
to combat the disease moving forward. With all the impressive scientific advances of the last year, expectations
are high for decisive policy action to begin to end this terrible epidemic."
