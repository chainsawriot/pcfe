Alcon, Embassy team (Cons, DAO, RSO) confirms identity of the Amcit. There appears to be no/no DoD connection in
this case. The AmCit may be retired mil but was in Iraq in a private capacity. There is no privacy act waiver obtained yet.
Team is taking Amcit from UN compound to embassy.

Colleaguesâ€”

Please see below for my notes from the two conference calls, at approximately 1240 EDT and 1430 EDT, regarding
released American citizen Randy Hultz.

Please reply all with any corrections or updates.

U.S. citizen Randy Michael Hultz (DOB                    ) was released today after being held by an Iraqi splinter group for
nine months. Hultz worked as a contractor at the Iraqi Ministry of Defense. He is currently at the headquarters of the UN
Mission Assistance Mission for Iraqi (UNAMI), and an Embassy Baghdad team including Diplomatic Security, Consular
Affairs, and Defense Attache personnel are on their way to UNAMI. The embassy team will interview Mr. Hulk and
determine next steps, likely including transporting Mr. Hultz to another location and, depending on whether he signs a
Privacy Act Waiver, notifying next of kin.

State Department Operations Center was notified of the release by UN Under Secretary General for Safety and Security
Greg Starr. Starr, who was formerly the Director of the State Department's Diplomatic Security Service, received a phone
call from UN Deputy Special Representative for Iraq Gyorgi Busztin. Bustzin reported that the Iraqi Deputy Speaker of
Parliament asked to visit UNAMI. When he arrived, he brought Hultz with him. Media report that Hultz was dressed in a
military uniform.

The UN reports that Hultz appears emaciated and exhausted, but has no other apparent medical issues or injuries. He
has not yet been examined by medical personnel.

The Sadr group has told press that Hultz was turned over as a "goodwill gesture."
