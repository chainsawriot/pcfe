             Congressional Black Caucus Task
               Force on Foreign Policy and
                  International Affairs
          Statement on Haiti Elections & OAS
                       Report

       Washington, DC â€” Chairman Emanuel Cleaver, II and Hon. Donald M.
       Payne, Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Task Force on Foreign
       Policy and International Affairs, released the following statement in
       response to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's support of OAS report:



       "The Congressional Black Caucus cannot overlook the serious concerns
       that the recent elections in Haiti have posed to its overall democracy. The
       CBC urges the United States and the international community to uphold
       the ideals of fairness and support a new Haiti election process that is free
       and fair, respecting the rights of the Haitian people.



       We are not blind to the complexity of this issue, as well as the need for a
       functional Haitian government. Our. Members have experienced first-
       hand the denial of voting rights, voter intimidation, and other acts of voter
       discrimination. No entity can truly report on the "will of the Haitian"
       people without accurately counting the unfair circumstances concerning
       the November elections. If the United States is going to play a role,
       public integrity calls for us to do for others what we would do for our own
       citizens: equal access and equal protection for those who want to
       participate in the democratic process.



       On January 7, 2010, Cheryl Mills, Counselor and Chief of Staff to
       Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, conceded that the United States would
       consider new elections if an OAS report recommended it. Philip Crowley,
       spokesman for the State Department, stated that "the first results did not
       reflect the vote of the people of Haiti," and added that, "strong indications
       that significant electoral fraud has been recorded and preliminary results
       disclosed do not reflect the actual vote of the Haitian people." Let us not

        attempt to disguise what we already know: the will of the people of Haiti
        was not, in good faith, represented. We believe that the recommendation
        of a new election should be included in the OAS report, and it should not
        be endorsed, in its entirety, as it currently stands.



        The "will of the Haitian people" is yet to be determined. We urge the
        Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to support a recommendation of new
        elections for Haiti. We are accountable for those things we say we
        support as a nation. As part of the very fabric of this country, the
        Congressional Black Caucus calls for a different message to be relayed to
        the people of Haiti."

        Donald M. Payne

        Chair, Congressional Black Caucus                              Congressional
