Jim Miller just called to say that Secretary Panetta has approved my appointment to the Board., In passing this on Miller
cited specifically Secretary Clinton's lobbying with Secretary Panetta. Please tell the Secretary how appreciative I am of
her engagement, and assure her that I will do my very best to serve my country from this position. Regards. Jim Jeffrey
