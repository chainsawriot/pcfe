Molho has been in bed with a stomach flu since Friday. Uzi had briefed him on the stmt, as did I this morning by phone.
They have no complaints and Molho will be in Brussels on the 2nd. He and I agreed to meet in Jslm on the 17th. I said I
wanted to brief him on the Russians, but did not go further given his state of health and the open line.

In Paris today, I lunch with the Norwegians, and meet Galey from the Elysee and Paoli from MFA. David
