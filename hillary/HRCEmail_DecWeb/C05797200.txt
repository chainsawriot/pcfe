Wendy: Thanks. We are following this closely. The situation is confused. A small group of soldiers have apparently taken
over the Ministry of Communication, but there does not appear any to be any effort to go attack the president's
headquarters or home or to take over the ministry of defense. Asmara is calm. We do not/not have any dependents at
post and our numbers are low. Number of US citizens is (very) small. A warden message is being sent out and our team
has met. Will keep you up to date. Johnnie
