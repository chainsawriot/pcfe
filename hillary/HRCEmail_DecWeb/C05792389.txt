The Kremlin website just posted a statement,
                           See our quick translation below.


"Vladimir Putin's telephone conversation with U.S. President Barack Obama: The U.S.
President congratulated Vladimir Putin on officially taking office as head of state. V. Putin and
B. Obama exchanged greetings on Victory Day over fascism, noted the historic significance of
the allied relations that linked our peoples during World War II, and offered best wishes to
veterans. During the conversation, which was held in a constructive spirit, the heads of state
discussed the prospects for developing Russian-American relations and personal contacts.
  **
The President of Russia informed B. Obama that he will not be able to take part in the G8
Summit due to the demands of continuing efforts to form a Government. Prime Minister
Medvedev will represent Russia at the summit, which will be held at Camp David on May 18-
19.

 The Russian and U.S. presidents agreed to hold a meeting on the margins of the G20 Summit,
 which will be held June 18-19 in Mexico."
