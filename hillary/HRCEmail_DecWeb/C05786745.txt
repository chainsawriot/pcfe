I just heard that there will be another service in Grand Rapids on Thursday which I could do before going to Turkey. But I
don't know if it's a public service or not.

 We could certainly ask for a plane on Tuesday.
 Here are my thoughts on the Tuesday schedule:
 Two Open Government events -- we could ask Bill Burns to cover.
 Speech at USGLC
                        1. its me only aay or meir conrerence.                                                               B5
 International Security Advisory Board -- Ellen can cover.
               ing with POTUS -- can reschedule.
[WP-Pid"APPit-- can have Bill cover and report back.

I feel an obligation to go to Betty Ford's funeral which I just learned is on Tuesday--yikes! What can be done to salvage
the Tuesday schedule? And could I get a plane to go?
