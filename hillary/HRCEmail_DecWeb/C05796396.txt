Cheryl,
See below list of candidates for sanctions coordinator that was created over the summer. I know Steve sent the list to
both Deputy Burns and Undersecretary Sherman. Let me know if you need any follow-up from our office.
Thanks, David



HR/CDA pulled together the following list of possible ex-COM candidates for the sanctions position. Some would require
a recall appointment.
