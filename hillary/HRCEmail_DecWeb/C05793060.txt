         Subj:         The McCain Amendment and U,S. Obligations under Article 16
                       of the Convention Against Torture

        Article 16 of the Convention Against Torture requires parties "to prevent in
        any territory under its jurisdiCtion other acts of cruel, inhuman, or degrading
        treatment or punishment which do not amount to torture ," The State
        Department agreed with the fustioe Department May 2005 conclusion that
        this Article did not apply to CIA interrogations in foreign counties.

        That situation has now changed, As a matter of policy, the U.S, government
        publicly extended the prohibition against cruel, inhuman, or degrading
        treatment to all conduct worldwide. And then, as a matter of law, the
        McCain Amendment extended the application of Article 16 of the
        Convention Against Torture to conduct by U.S. officials anywhere in the
        world.

        The prohibitions of Article 16 of the CAT now do apply to the enhanced
        interrogation techniques authorized for employment by CIA. In this case,
        given the relationship of domestic law to the question of treaty
        interpretation, the responsibility of advising on interpretation is shared by
        both the Department of State and the Department of Justice.

        The Senate's reservation stated that the CAT's ban on "criiel, inhuman, or
        degrading teatment or punishment" would bind the U.S. only insofar as it
        meant the cruel, unusual and inhumane treatment or punishment prohibited
        by the Fifth, Eighth, and/or Fourteenth Amendments. So, to define the
        CAT's,ban, we are to look principally to America's 'cruel and unusual'
        standard. Though that standard is found in the Eighth Amendment, the
        Senate's invocation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments made sense
        because, as a matter of substantive due process, "the Due Process Clause of
        the Fourteenth Amendment [which uses the same language as the Fifth
        Amendment] incorporates the Eighth Amendment's guarantee against cruel

          and unusual punishment" Goodman v. Georgia; 126 S.Ct, 877, 879 (Jan.
          10, 2006), citing Louisiana ex rel Francis v. Resvieber, 329 U.S. 459,463
          (1947).

         The "cruel and unusual" standard is alsci the kat restrictive standard
         available anywhere in American jurisprudence, After all, the Eighth
         Amendment sets the floor on what can be done to the most dangerous
         offenders.thatexist in American law, people who can legally be punished,
         even legally put to death. All other Standards of treatment in American law
         are more restrictive, since they apply to people who have not been convicted
         of crimes (as with pretrial detention, civil commitnient, etc.) and,where the
         due process standard judges whether they can be deprived of their liberty at
         all. This is why the "cruel and unusual' test is considered one aspect of
         substantive due process, where it is a kind of floor in a. larger structure of
         protections. E.g., Jones v, Johnson, 781 F.2d 769 (9th Cix. 1986)(8th
         Amendment as minimum standard in case involving pretrial detention).

         Further, the term "degrading" it a vaguer and potentially more restrictive
         term than "cruel" or "inliurnari." This is another reason why it is fortunate
         that the Senate pointed to the "cruel and unusual" line of cases as tile place
         to define the ban, 1

         There are a great many cases on the meaning of "cruel and unusual." As the
         Supreme Court has repeatedly said, writing about conditions of confinement,
         the words should be interpreted in a "flexible and dynamic manner." "No
        'static test can exist by which courts may determine whether conditions of
         I OLC did not cite Eighth AMMOCIMCIlt precedents in its 2005 opinion because the Eighth Amendment
         would not apply to people who had not been judged guilty of a crime. (1) This argument confuses two
         kinds of references. The Senate commanded that the `cruel and unusual' standard be used for substantive
         definition of conduct prevented by the treaty, not for a definition of the categories of people who could
         claim the treaty's protections, (2) The distinction is also substantively immaterial. No constitutional
         protections formally apply to these prisoners. The protections, including the Fifth Amendment ones that
         OLC acknowledges, are all being artificially imported to them by the operation of the CAT and the Senate
         reaervation. The Eighth Amendment carries over jot as well, both directly and through its inclusion as an
         aspect of the substantive due process protected under the Fifth and Fourteenth. (3) The Eighth
         Amendment In a minimum standard. If we reject this standard because the people have not been convicted
         of a crime, the government must find a standard of treatment oven higher,. and more restrictive, that would
                                                                      .

         confinement are cruel and unusual, for the Eighth Amendment 'must draw
         its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress -
         of a maturing society,' Rhodes v. Chapinal, 452 U.S. 337, 346 (1981),
         citing Tros v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101 (1958). The treatment Or punishment
         need not be barbarous. The Court has used terms like "serious deprivations
         of human needs" or conditions which "deprive inmates of the minimal
         civilized measure of life's necessities." But treatment Or punishment, if it is
         otherwise justified, can certainly be "restrictive and even harsh." Rhodes;
         452 U,S, at 347.

        Though the Supreme Court has frequently been divided on applying the
        "evolving standards of decency" test, it has clearly agreed that, "In
        discerning those 'evolving standards,' we have looked to objective evidence
        of how our society views a particular punishment today," looking for
        reliable objective evidence of contemporary values, such as the practices of
        legislatures. Penn/ v, Lvnaugh, 492 U.S. 302, 331 (1989)(unaninunis
        portion of opinion).

        In addition to the 'cruel and unusual' standard, which especially applies to
        conditions of confinement, the substantive due process requirements also
        prohibit methods of interrogation that would "shook the conscience." Both
        standards must be discussed. The enhanced interrogation techniques
        combine manipulations of the conditions of confinement with the use of
        specific coercive methods during the questioning itself.

       The 'shocks the conscience' test has been applied to interrOgations on
        several occasions, but such cases are now relativelytare. The Court ruled in
       2003, for example, that a man who had been questioned for ten minutes
       while in pain after being justifiably wounded by police officers could sue
       with a claim that his right to substantive due process had been violated by
       conduct that shocked the conscience. Chavez v. Martinez, 538 U.S. 760
       (2003), Such interrogation cases have seldom risen to Supreme Court
       review in the post-Miranda era since the 1960s. Among the last such cases,.
       the Court found violations of due process where the prisoner had been held
       incommunicado and questioned for a prolonged period, E.g., Darwin v.

           Connecticut, 391 U.S. 346(1968); Clewis v.:Texas, 386 US. 707 (1967).
           In another case where a police officer questioned a wounded prisoner,
           threatened to kill him, and fired a gun near his ear, the Court also found
           "gross coercion," Beecher v, Alabama, 389 U.S. 35, 38 (1967).

           In applying both tests, courts look to cumulative effect — it judges the acts
           both alone or in combination. Abodes, 452 U.S. at 347 (sometimes also
           referred to as the "totality of circumstances").

           The cases reveal a spectrum of views. Some techniques that are merely
           intrusive or harsh may pass either test if there is a worthy state interest in
           using them. Almost all of the techniques in question here would be deemed
           wanton and unnecessary and would immediately fail to pass muster unless
           there was a strong state interest in using them. So we presume for this
           opinion that they are all justified by a valid state interest — the need to obtain
           information to protect the country.

           But that is only part of the test. Under American law, there is no precedent
           for excusing treatment that is intrinsically "cruel" even if the state asserts a
           compelling need to use it

          The OLC agrees that some conduct is prohibited no matter how compelling
          the state interest may be. In attempting to define such intrinsically
          prohibited conduct, OLC. looked at whether the enhanced interrogation         .
          techniques in question caused severe pain or suffering or inflicted significant
          or lasting harm. In other words, OLC concluded that "the techniques do not
          amount to torture." OLC opinion of May 30 (p. 27 and note 26 in the May
          26 draft).

          But the CAT's Article 16 states explicitly that the prohibited cruel, inhuman,
          or degrading treatment orpunishmentare acts "which do not amount to
          torture*" Moreover, OLC's own opinion. on the legal definition of torture
          emphasizes the difference. OLC quoted the Senate's explanation that:
          "'Torture' is thus to be distinguished from lesser forms of cruel, inhuman, or
          degrading treatment or punishnient, which are to be deplored and prevented,
                                                                                                             1.4(C)

                but are not so universally and categorically condemned as to warrant the
                severe legal consequences that the Convention provides in the case of
                torture." OLC opinion of Dec, 3,0, 2004, p. 4, see also note 14.

                If the techniquea, taken together, are intrinsically cruel, inhuman, or
                degrading — i.e., if under Americo constitutional law they 1,vould be either
                be conaidered cruel and unusual or shock the conscience, then they are
                prohibited. They can be barred, per se, even if they do not amount to-torture.
                And they can be barred even if there is a compelling state interest asserted to
                justify them.

             In looking to objective standards to inform a judgment aboutevolving      •
             standards of decency or interrogation techniques that shock the conscience,
             three sources stand out:

                   D American government practice, by any agency, in holding or
                       questioning enemy combatants —including enemy combatants who do
                       not have Geneva protection or who were regarded at the time as
                       suspected terrorists, guerrillas, spies, or saboteurs. We are unaware .of
                       any precedent in World War tr, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, or
                       any subsequent conflict for authotized, systematic interrogation
                       practices similar to those in question here, even where the prisoners
                       were presumed to be unlawful combatants.2

                  El Recent practice by police and prison authorities in confining or
                     questioning their most dangerous suspects. This practice is especially
                     helpful since these authorities are governed by substantively similar
                     standards to those that would apply under the CAT, given the Senate's
                     reservation. We have not conducted a review of American domestic

            3 OLC noted that some of the questioned practices am openly regarded as torture in the A.rmyField
            Manual. It said that the Manual applied to combatants receiving Geneva protections, and these do not.
            OLC did not discussmilitary practice in confining and questioning enemy combatants who did not qualify
            for Geneva protection, Also, the question of whether combatants are protected or not is not necessarily
            relevant to noting whether the military regards the practices as torturous or cruel, for the purpose of
            establishing evolving standards of decency.

                       practice. From the available cases, it appears likely that some of the
                       techniques being used would likely pass muster; sevesal almost
                       certainly would not,3

             It therefore appears to us that several of these techniques, singly or in                                                B1
             combination, should be considered "cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
             or punishment" vdthin the meaning of Article 1.6.

             The techniques least likely to be sustained are the techniques described as
             "coercive," especially, viewed cumnlatively, such as the waterboard,
             dousing; stress positions, and cramped confinement,

             Those most likely to be sustained are the basic detention conditions and, in
             context, the corrective techniques, such as slaps.

             The control conditions, such as nudity, sleep deprivation, and liquid diet,
             may also be sustainable, depending on the circumstances and details of how
             these techniques are used.




            3 OLC did not review domestic practice of police and prison authorities. OLC did argue that national
            security interests could justify more invasive practices than might perhaps be justifiable only by law
            enforcement interests. Thb.may be a valid argument where the technique might be close to thrline,
            domestically. But if the technique, or techniques, would violate domestic cmunimtional standards, his
            nonetheless forbidden. The Senate pointed to domestic comatitutionai law ati the source for defining this
            international treaty obligation.
