The FM's meeting for COMs was a reiteration of familiar GOB charges against Grameen/Yunus to a larger audience.         B1
Reading from a prepared text, the FM also noted the impending GOB announcement of an investigation committee. The
Norwegian Ambassador pointed out that her aovernment had cleared Grameen/Yunus of charges resurfaced in the earlier
Norwegian TV documentary.

continue pressing for an appointment with the Prime Minister. Regards, Nick
