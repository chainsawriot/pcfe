Subject: Ambassadorial Candidate for Uberia -- Deb Malac

Cheryl:        You asked me earlier today to remind you of your desire to meet with Deb Malac who was selected
several weeks ago by the D Committee to be our next COM in Liberia. Deb is currently Director for East African Affairs
in the African Bureau. She has                                  _                        She served previously as
DCM in Addis and has several assignments in West Africa, including in Dakar, Senegal. I think Deb is
                                                                        I told Deb today that you would like to speak
with her and that Joanne would probably be in contact.


          Also,


Johnnie
