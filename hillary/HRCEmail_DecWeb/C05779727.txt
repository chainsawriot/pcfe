Wes Clark called again. He has been approached by his same contacts, pushing for more meetings. They now want him
to negotiate a ceasefire, leaving Q in country. He knows that's a non-starter and knows he can't/shouldn't play that role.

But he was in an expansive mood with me nonetheless. He thought we should consider an option where Q would have
to leave "temporarily," while ceasefire and political process and dialogue issues were worked out. But we hold the door
open for a possible return of Q if "the people demand it," as Mohammed Ismail keeps telling him is the case.

He also thought it's time for us to expand upon the UNSCR 1973 language and "call Qadhafi's bluff' by establishing
detailed performance benchmarks that would be nominally consistent with Q's offer of a ceasefire and political process.
I noted that Q's previous words about a ceasefire have been at odds with his actions on the ground. That's the point,
Clark argued -- make him perform or demonstrate clearly his failure to do so.

FYI. I have been in touch with Wes Clark over the last few days. He has had two Libya-related meetings. On Friday, in
Switzerland, General Clark saw "Sheikh Tamar" from Oman, a friend of Saif Qadhafi. On Saturday, in London, he saw
Mohammed Ismail, Saif Qadhafi's chief of staff who has been flitting around Europe (and is the one who's been in touch
with the Norwegians).

General Clark worked out his script with me ahead of both meetings. His bottom line for them both was the elder Q has
to go. From his descriptions of the two meetings, it sounds as though General Clark was extremely hard-hitting. But in
both cases, his interlocutors resisted the message, saying Q would stay in Libya but in an (unlikely) low-profile way.
General Clark would have none of it.

General Clark expects Mohammed Ismail, who he said starts his travel back to Libya tonight, will stay in touch with him.
General Clark will stay in touch with me if he hears from either interlocutor again.
