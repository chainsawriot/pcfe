Subject:                           Eliott Abrams is arguing that Israel should recognize Palestine



Here is the link. httplitgoo.,,lifblIC8ax Interesting when the argument is coming from both the right and the left. It
would allow you and POTUS to have accomplished the goal POTUS laid out at UNGA last year and wd make it much
harder for Syrians, Iranians, even Saudis to use this issue to divert domestic opposition, strengthening the seismic shift
across the region to create fault-lines around reform/no reform instead of Arabs/US-Israel. AM
