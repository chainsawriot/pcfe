Hi Cheryl,

For what it's worth, if S decides to do the Somalia conference
                                                                             Lona advises a good week for
scheduling the CoM conference could be the week of March 12. By my calculation, Bill, Tom, Wendy and Pat
are all scheduled to be here that week. So is PM Cameron, but that shouldn't be a problem for our purposes.

Steve
