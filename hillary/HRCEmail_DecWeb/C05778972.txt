Below is from Shadi Hamid, the research director at the Brookings Doha Center. He's in Cairo now, talking to the MB...

Hi Martin,
It was remarkable and a bit surreal. Was in Tahrir Square after the announcement. Everyone was chanting
"you're egyptain, raise your head up high" - that pretty much captures it.

As for MB, I've been meeting with a number of them the last couple days. I don't think they really see this as
their moment, even though it probably could be (if they were ready and able to take advantage of it). Their
message now appears to be "under no circumstances do we want to govern." Seems that what they want more
than anything else is to be left alone and operate and grow without government harassment or interference. In
that respect, the group is better understood as a religious movement rather than a political party (I actually wrote
an article on why Islamists deliberately lose elections for Journal of Democracy, which can be found here). The
two opeds demonstrate the MB's sensitivity to international opinion and their paranoia about another
Algeria/Palestine. They have a phrase for this - the 'American veto.'

Worth also noting that MB has been in opposition for 8 decades, and now they're being asked to potentially
govern. MB is nervous about that, just as they are regarding any kind of rapid change. MB is a massive
bureaucracy - a slow, bumbling giant of sorts - and now they may need to take more decisive action. That's not
something they've generally been good at.

Hope this is helpful.

best,
shadi

Hi Shadi,

I trust you're safe. How I envy your experience! I never imagined it would happen in my lifetime. And now
the ME will never be the same again.

I have to write an op-ed for the FT today about implications for US policy. I'd be interested in your take on
how the MB will play the game. They launched an impressive charm offensive with simultaneous op-eds in
the NYT and the Washpost this week (the political equivalent of AQ's simultaneous attacks). And Obama
reciprocated in his remarks yesterday "Above all, this transition must bring all of Egypt's voices to the
table...".

On the other hand I heard that Sheikh Qaradawi returned to Egypt yesterday. Any idea how they plan to play
the game now that their moment has arrived?
