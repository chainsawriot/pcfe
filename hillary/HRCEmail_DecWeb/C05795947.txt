upholding constitution.

Madam Secretary: I think there are several things we can do which would send a strong signal of support: your call
would be a most significant; we can issue a statement of congratulation and support from you, also noting we look
forward to re-engaging on MCC (the WH is planning on issuing a statement today); in addition, calls from Daniel
Yohannes from MCC saying we want to look for ways to help Malawi get back on the right track; a call from U/S Sherman
who met Banda on her recent trip. We can work up a statement from you for release fairly quickly. We will also reach
out to USAID for further ideas. Johnnie
