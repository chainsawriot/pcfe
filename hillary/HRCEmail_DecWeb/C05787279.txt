Dear Heather:

Many thanks for sending me the invitation and information regarding the East-West Center Board Position. I Appreciate
very much your time and courtesies.

The East-West Center is an institution and an organization I greatly respect and revere. I've had the opportunity to interact
with the Center during my term as a US Ambassador which I thoroughly enjoyed. I would be honored if the Secretary of
State selects me as a new member of its Governing Board.

Kindly forward me all pertinent documentation/paperwork necessary to comply with this process. Also, I have a tentative
appointment at DOS tomorrow around 1:00pm. Would it be possible to meet with you either before or after that
appointment? Kindly advise. Thank you.

Warm regards, Osman.

Ambassador Siddique:

Great speaking with you today.

Per our conversation, below and attached is further background regarding the East-West Center itself and responsibility of
Board Members.

As you know, the East-West Center, based in Honolulu, promotes better relations and understanding among the people
and nations of the U.S., Asia, and the Pacific through cooperative study, research, and dialogue.

The 18 member board includes five members appointed by the Secretary, five appointed by the Governor of Hawaii, and
five international members chosen by the Board itself. The Secretary's appointees serve for a three year term. The
position does not require senate confirmation.

The Board meets twice per year in Honolulu, with several subcommittees on various initiatives.

Below is the link to the Center's website. I also attached a document sent to me by Dr. Morrison outlining
responsibilities of Board members.

Let me know if there's any additional information I can provide you.

Many thanks.
Heather
