LENO: "So tell me about Hillary Clinton and the job she's doing."

OBAMA: "She has been, I think, as good of a secretary of State as we've seen in this country. She's been
outstanding. (Applause, cheers.) She's done a great job. We're really proud of her. ... The truth is Hillary and I
agreed on the vast majority of issues ... during the campaign. In fact, one of the problems with all those debates
was you'd start running out of stuff to say, because, you know, we had a similar world view. She was, I think
understandably, tired after the campaign and hesitant about whether or not this would be a good fit. And I told
her that I had complete confidence in her, that the country needed her. She stepped up to the plate. She works as
hard as anybody I've ever seen. She is tenacious. And we are really very proud of her.
