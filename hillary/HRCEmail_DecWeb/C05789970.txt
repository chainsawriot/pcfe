Subject: Egypt - Review of economic assistance

Raj:

The Secretary has asked for a review of our economic assistance to Egypt; she understandably wants to ensure that
what we are doing is focused; aligned with current priorities and opportunities; and produces some high-impact, high-
visibility results in the near term. This is consistent with her desire to demonstrate that we are changing the way we do
business, and that the US get some credit for what we are doing.

I understand from Jake that he, Bill and Rob are working with your team and Cairo to do a rapid review, including of our
ongoing programs. Given the difficulty and priority.of this, the team in Cairo may need some moral and technical
support to get there â€” particularly when they have to make some tough decisions.

The Secretary, as we all are, is looking for the best way to position ourselves in the new political landscape, which may
mean as it has in other places that we have to stop doing some of what we are doing now to focus on higher priorities
and emerging opportunities.

Can you connect with Jake and Rob so we have a process to prioritize this activity and to ensure as we step through this
we get the best from the team on the ground. And if needed, it may appreciated if we offer Mara and the mission in
Cairo some extra help as well.

Can you address?

Thanks.
