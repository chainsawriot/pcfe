All — Susan asked that I pass on the following to you from her. Note Arabs meeting today at noon. - Erica     B1

I just spoke again to the Lebanese PR who affirmed that the plan and his preference remains to wait until my return and
my meeting with the Arabs on Tues before taking any action.

                                                                 The Arabs are meeting today at noon.
