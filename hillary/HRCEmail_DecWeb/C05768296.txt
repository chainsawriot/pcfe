A couple of updates.

(1) Further to Huma's email



(2) The House convenes tomorrow at 1 pm. There will be an hour of debate on rule, then a vote on the rule between 2
pm and 3 pm. There will then be two hours of debate, followed by a vote on the bill and a vote on reconciliation at
approximately 5 pm.

3 With res • ect to the abortion issue,
                                                                                      but Congressman Stupak has
indicated that the EO will not suffice for his purposes. However, I'm also told "five or six members" of Stupak's coalition
are satisfied by the EO.
