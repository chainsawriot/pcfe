All I can do is pass on your question or info to the appropriate person. Now that Lauren has left to work as a special
assistant to Bill Gates, why don't you send any requests or questions to Rob Russo, who has replaced her. I have copied
him so you can follow up.

Subject: hey boss...

I need your help on 2 separate issues... they're both business related (including State)... I prefer talking about less
germane items but these are important and want to discuss... I'm happy to do so my email but wanted to check with you
before sending along matters/issues of a personal business nature...
