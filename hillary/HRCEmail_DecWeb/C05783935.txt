Kurt,
Brunei just announced that it's going with Sikorsky. There are still a few hurdles to clear but this is fantastic news.

All - Dato Mustappa just called me to say Brunei is going for Sikorsky. He added that there is still a wide gap that has to
be closed between the two sides on the specific contract terms.

I expressed deep appreciation regarding the very welcome news of the pro-Sikorsky decision and asked if there were any
restrictions on whom I could tell. He said no restrictions as far as Brunei is concerned. The news will be in tomorrow's
newspaper.

Sounds like there is still some work to do, but congratulations to Sikorsky!

Best,

Dan

Hi Linda -- I saw Deputy Defense Minister Dato Mustappa on November 11, reaffirmed strong U.S. government support for Sikorsky,
noted our interest in a quick positive decision, and asked him how things are going on the Brunei side.

He said Brunei and Sikorsky remain far apart on the terms.




I hope this information is helpful.

Best,

Dan
