                                        LIBYA: List of Interlocutors and Emissaries

African Union

The African Union (AU) roadmap proposes a ceasefire, a pause in hostilities for a humanitarian corridor, and a political
transition, but does not include Qadhafi's departure from power. Although Qadhafi has endorsed the roadmap, the Libyan
Transitional National Council (TNC) has rejected it. The AU Ad Hoc group (led by Mauritanian President Azziz and
accompanied by South African President Zuma, Malian President Toure, and representatives from Congo Brazzaville and
Uganda) met with Qadhafi in Tripoli and TNC representatives in Benghazi from April 9-11. (Note: President Zuma did
not travel to Benghazi, but sent the South African FM.) The AU most recently issued a statement at its May 25 meeting in
Addis Ababa which did not endorse Qadhafi stepping down. The AU position at this meeting was advocated by Ugandan
President Museveni who specifically criticized NATO airstrikes and demanded the suspension of all attacks by NATO
and others.

AF is currently drafting a strategy for engagement with the AU and AU member states, including those who defend
Qadhafi. AF will also press the 12 African countries which support Qadhafi's departure, as well as AU members Algeria,
Egypt and Tunisia, to be more vocal in undercutting Qadhafi's influence.

Egypt

Egypt sent an envoy to Benghazi the week of May 23 to meet with the TNC. We do not know what message the
                                                                                                                   1.4(B)

Libya

GOL PM al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi held a press conference on May 26 to echo the points raised in a letter he
reportedly send to select foreign capitals. (Note: The United States did not receive PM al-Mahmoudi's letter,
nor did the UK, Italy or France). Qadhafi advisor Fouad Zlitni called Ambassador Cretz on May 27 to reiterate
the points raised by PM al-Mahmoudi at his press conference: GOL acceptance of UNSCRs 1970 and 1973;
commitment to an immediate ceasefire and agreement to have the date set by the AU and UN; agreement to
receive international observers to monitor ceasefire; commitment to engage in an inclusive political dialogue;
agreement to form a temporary executive caretaker government, including current elements of GOL structure as
well as all other parties; and agreement to work on a constitution and discuss civil society and freedom of
speech.

The Qadhafi regime has also met with the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood leadership in Egypt. According to Qadhafi chief
of staff Fouad Zlitni, the Muslim Brotherhood asserts that TNC may be the political leadership of the opposition, but the
real power lies with the Libyan Brotherhood and they are apparently willing to bide their time.

The Qadhafi regime also offered to send senior tribal leaders to Benghazi to negotiate with the TNC, but the TNC rejected
the proposal.

Malta

GOL FM Abdulati Obeidi traveled to Malta to offer the GOL's willingness to discuss a ceasefire and transition plan, but
not Qadhafi's departure.

Norway




Turkey




Spain

Former Spanish PM Gonzales had planned to travel to Tripoli to meet with GOL officials. We have not confirmed if this
trip took place.

President Zuma traveled to Tripoli on May 30 to meet with Qadahfi to deliver the message that he must step down. Press
reports indicate that Zuma is working with Turkish counterparts, but we have not confirmed that.                              B5



Russia

GOL officials traveled to Moscow to meet with the Russians.

United Kingdom

The UK submitted a roadmap to the first Contact Group meeting in Doha on April 13, which proposes a ceasefire and the
departure of Qadhafi from power.

Saif al-Islam's chief of staff Mohammed Ismail met with the UK to offer the regime's willingness to discuss a ceasefire
and transition plan, but not Qadhafi's departure.

United States

Saadi Qadhafi asked former Congressman Curt Weldon to visit Tripoli in April to meet with his father. Weldon traveled
to Tripoli and met with GOL PM al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi, who passed him a letter to the Secretary.

Saif al-Islam's chief of staff Mohammed Ismail called General Wesley Clark (ret.) to offer the regime's willingness to
discuss a ceasefire and transition plan, but not Qadhafi's departure.

Most recently, Qadhafi advisor Fouad Zlitni contacted Ambassador Cretz on May 27 to convey a message from GOL PM
al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi to the USG. PM al-Mahmoudi's message stated that the GOL is committed to implementing
UNSCRs 1970 and 1973, especially the ceasefire. PM al-Mahmoudi's message also noted that the GOL wants to deal
exclusively with the United States, believing that a true solution can only be reached with assistance from us and not from
other intermediaries. Zlitni said PM al-Mahmoudi is willing to travel anywhere to have this direct dialogue with the
United States. Zlitni stressed to Amb Cretz that the GOL does not want to waste any more time and that the United States
should initiate this dialogue as soon as possible.
