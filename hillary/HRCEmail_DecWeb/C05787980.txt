Subject: VP travel to WHA

You may already know this, but VP will travel to Mexico and Honduras March 4-6. Mexicans and
Hondurans informed today, but still obviously close hold. Honduras would be a Central American
gathering, as Honduras is head of SICA. Would be down Sunday night RON in Mexico; all day
Monday 3/5 in Mexico and RON there; 3/6 am on to Honduras for Centam and bilateral meeting and
then home (no RON in Honduras). More when I know it. Thanks, Roberta
