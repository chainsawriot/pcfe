Hi there!

I just thought you'd like to know that our dear
                                                            Seems like a long time ago.


I keep thinking I'll run into you over here at the White House since I see your name on the schedule so frequently. I've
got another few months here before my detail expires and I head back to HHS, so maybe I'll see you yet.


Hope you are well.
Andrea
