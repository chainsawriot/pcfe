 Subject: Judeh

 Please don't use this yet outside, but Judeh sent me a string - over a dozen - SMS this morning,                               1.4(B)
                                                                                                                                1.4(D)
                                                                                                                                B1 /




 Useful wake up call to them both, l's and TB.

 Judeh is my first substantive stop - lunch after I land.
