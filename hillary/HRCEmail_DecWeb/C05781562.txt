FYI all: WJB asked me to make sure you're aware that Jill Biden is planning to visit Ethiopia and Kenya in about a week to
check in on our embassies, thank them for their hard work, and likely visit a refugee camp. Gayle Smith is coordinating.
You may be planning for this already, but he just heard this news from NSS tonight and wanted to pass it along. NSS
asked to keep it close hold, for security reasons. Best, Uzra
