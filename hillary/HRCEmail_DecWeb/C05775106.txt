      We are continuing our discussions with DoD regarding the "rebalancing" efforts but the mood has shifted
significantly in the past month and we are beginning to encounter resistance to moving forward in any meaningful way.




As you know, I strongly believe that our national security goals would best be served if U.S. civilians under State
Department leadership led all USG engagement, strategic communication, and public diplomacy activities with foreign
civilian populations, with the exception of active combat zones. This is a matter of both principle and practicality.
Civilian processes should be used to determine our nation's engagement priorities, the type and range of programs to
deploy, and the end results sought. From the perspective of global publics, civilians are more credible and thus more
effective spokespersons for the U.S. in the long run. I am also convinced that experienced, language-fluent, and
culturally aware State Department public diplomacy professionals can achieve strategic communications and
engagement objectives more efficiently and effectively than their DoD counterparts. Officer for officer and dollar for
dollar, we can produce better results.




DoD agrees in principle to civilian leadership on engagement activities, but has a different perspective of what this
would mean.

 Since March, my office's Global Strategic Engagement Center (GSEC) has been meeting informally with DoD
counterparts to gather information about military information operations, and share information about overlapping or
similar State PD efforts, and to consider the resources and capabilities State will need to take on programs transferred
from DoD




In order to keep things moving, and as part of the 2012 budget process, I have instructed my staff to recommence their
review of Department of Defense information operations and, based on the information we have been able to obtain so
far, draw up a list of DoD programs that we believe may be better executed by State/




I intend to continue personally engaging with senior DoD leadership in Washington and commanders in the field to
articulate our position and encourage their support and will ask my staff to do the same at the appropriate levels.
Recently, in a speech he gave at the Marshall Center, General Petraeus stated that he supported increasing State's
capacity to expand our public diplomacy efforts and that he was working with me to achieve this objective./

I am leaving for London this afternoon and will be seeing Petraeus at dinner on Tuesday. I'm going to Doha on
Wednesday to have my meetings with al Jazeera and will also be visiting CENTCOM to be briefed on their Middle East
information operations.




I'll continue to keep you posted at things move forward.
