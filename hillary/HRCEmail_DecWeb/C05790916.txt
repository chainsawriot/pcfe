Just finished our daily call. Not much new. Anne sees al-Assar tomorrow to run through final
details. McCain/Graham call with Tantawi now scheduled for tomorrow after Anne's meeting, so it
can be used to press on any loose ends. Anne says the internal USG arrangements are in good
shape.

Two action items for you guys:




Thanks.
