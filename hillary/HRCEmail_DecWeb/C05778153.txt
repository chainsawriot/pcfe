Since I'm now seeing Calderone, we need something significant to say and or deliver. Could I take him a letter from
POTUS? Deliver a visit from VP? Lay out our Central America secutiry strategy and ask him to work w us and Santos?
Offer more drones or other support for his forces? Other ideas?

He told me he would get them to me mid-morning. I will be in the office around 10 and will ping him then.
