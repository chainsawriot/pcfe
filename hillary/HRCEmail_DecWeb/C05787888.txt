Subject: US fires 1st drone in Pakistan since fatal strike (AP)

WASHINGTON - (AP) The U.S. has fired off its first drone strike into Pakistan since the errant Nov. 25
airstrikes that killed two dozen Pakistani troops at two posts along the mountainous border.
   A U.S. official says the strike, likely from a CIA drone, occurred Tuesday afternoon.
   U.S. officials say there had been no promise by the U.S. government that such drone operations would be
avoided, but the lull was part of a broad effort to tamp down tensions with Pakistan.
   The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the drone operations are classified.
