Subject: URGENT - Syria press statement.

All â€” Apologies that I am only sending this to you now, however events have been quite fluid in NY on Syria. Amb Rice
met her like-minded counterparts this evening to discuss tomorrow's briefing by Annan's deputy and the expected
briefing by Annan on April 12th. A readout of that discussion is at the end of this email.

In today's discussion, the like-minded agreed to support pursuing a UNSC press statement on Syria, with the objective of
seeking quick agreement among the Council tomorrow. Amb Rice agrees and believes we are better off trying to secure
a statement along the lines of what is drafted below. This statement is drafted with the anticipated April 12th briefing by
Kofi Annan in mind.

I asked for your comments/clearance by 9:00am tomorrow.

Rexon
