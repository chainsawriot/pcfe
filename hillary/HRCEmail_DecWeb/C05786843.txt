Madame Secretaryâ€”As you know, Doug Lute-will be leaving the NSC on July 1. Our current leading candidate to replace
Doug is                                                                              The due diligence reports are
quite good. Wanted to see if you had a strong view one way or the other.

Thanks.

Tom
