        I'm so happy things have worked out thus far as they did in Lybia, Harold -- happy for the people
        there, happy for NATO, happy for the administration, and happy for you personally. It's true that
        I was among the people who were unpersuaded by your and the WH's legal view of what
        constitute "hostilities," and I know hindsight can be 20/20, but in retrospect I have to say that
        your view of the matter may have been the wiser one. We obviously can't know precisely what
        the future there will hold, but thus far it's a marvelous triumph and one that sacrificed no
        American lives and relatively little American treasure.

        Larry
