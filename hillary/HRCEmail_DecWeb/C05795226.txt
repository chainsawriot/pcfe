          Dear Heather and Cheryl,




          Thanks again for nominating me to the East-West Center Board. I had a long meeting with the
          Center President when he was in Washington recently, and I look forward to my first Board
          Meeting in Honolulu later this week. I've promised Heather a report on my return.
