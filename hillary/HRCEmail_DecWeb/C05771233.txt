I just landed in Newark and called Molho. He will be flying to NY on Monday -- does not have his arrival time. Will be
available for meetings with Erekat on Tuesday, possibly also Monday night depending on his arrival time. Plans to fly out
Tuesday night.

I'm boarding a plane and have been unable to speak to Molho since 7 pm last night, when he didn't have an answer on
his availability in NY but was about to see the PM.




Julia, we'll need a place to meet. My own view is USUN would be best. May need it for several hours.
