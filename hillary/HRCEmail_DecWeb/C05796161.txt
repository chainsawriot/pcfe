This is really good -- it suggests that he really wants affirmation for what he is doing. Kurt

Subject: RE: GOC invite to Pres Thein Sein for C2C

Good news everyone — after speaking with Thant Myint-U and Myanmar Egress President Tin Maung Thann, they
confirmed with Minister Soe Thein that the President will attend. They will have MOFA fax the dip note to the
Cambodian Foreign Ministry today. (I originally spoke with MOFA, who told me that the President was not available -
will try to close that loop with them).

Tin Maung Thann will be with the President tomorrow to go over the program. Could you provide us with a notional
agenda that we can share with him as well as proposed time for the S-Thein Sein bilat? I suggest that we continue to
multiple-track this with the Burmese SOM, Cambodian FM, Burmese FM, and Thant Myint-U/Soe Thein/Tin Maung
Thann.

The formal letter from S to TS was signed and transmitted. As derek noted it is a bit weird to get cambodia to issue invite
if they aren't hosting. Joe seeing burmese som this afternoon and will raise.

Subject: Re: GOC invite to Pres Thein Sein for C2C

I just got off the phone with the PM's Chief of Staff. The PM does not want to issue an invitation to an event that he is not
hosting/organizing. His office suggested that it be handled the same as it was with Yingluck: the Secretary issues the
invitation and then the Burmese notify the Cambodian MFA that their President plans to attend (with the concurrence of
the PM.)

Please let me know if we can make this work, and if so, we'll reach out to the Burmese embassy in Phnom Penh to
coordinate.

We've reached out to the PM's office informally and following up with a dipnote to MFA. No response yet, but we'll
continue following up throughout the day.

Jeff/Nirav/Joe — verifying that you will be working with Cambodian MOFA to generate an official invite for Pres Thein
Sein to attend C2C Forum in Siam Reap on July 13.

We will double track the issue with Burmese MOFA here. Is there anything else you need us to do?

Thanks, Eleanor

On another issue, Thant Myint-U just called to relay a request from the Presidential Office in NPT asking whether Thein
Sein would get a meeting w/S should he accept an invitation "from the Cambodians" to travel there next week. I
responded we had a great interest in TS traveling to Cambodia next week to provide him a platform to talk about
changes in Burma and would expect a meeting with S would be looked on favorably if he did travel. Thant said this
message/request will be passed thru the embassy in Rangoon. I wanted to alert you all soonest as well. Not sure it
means for certain that TS will travel but good sign.

Derek
