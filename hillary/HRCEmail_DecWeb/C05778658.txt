Frank Wisner, the retired American diplomat sent by President Barack Obama to Cairo this past week to tell Mubarak
that the U.S. saw his rule coming to an end, said Mubarak had to keep a leadership role at least temporarily if the
"fragile glimmerings" of progress were to take hold as quickly as needed. "President Mubarak's role remains utterly
critical in the days ahead while we sort our way toward a future" in which Egypt is peaceful and moderate, and
committed to its international obligations, including its peace treaty with Israel, Wisner said in his first public comments
about the mission. He told the conference by a video from New York that the international community had to play a
"protective and encouraging role." "There is a chance but we are in the early stages of seeing this take shape," Wisner
said. "It is not certain that matters cannot slip off the rails, that you can't have renewed violence, violence in which
radicals can push their case forward."
