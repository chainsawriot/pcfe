Dear Hillary,

I was so glad to see the pictures of you this week back at work; you look great and the affection of the entire
Department was evident. I heard from Jake that you got sent enough flowers to open a florist's shop!




                                                                                  I will seek your counsel as soon as it is
possible, but truly, what I most want to see is you getting a real break.

All best,
AM
