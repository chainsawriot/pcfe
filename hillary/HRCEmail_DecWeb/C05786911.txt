Subject: Suspected suicide bomber wounds 10 in SE Turkey (Reuters)



VAN, Oct 29 (Reuters) - A suspected suicide bomber died in an attack that wounded 10 people in Bingol, a
town in Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast on Saturday, Interior Minister Idris Naim Sahin said.

  The blast occurred close to the office of the ruling AK Party, and police said the suspected suicide bomber
was a woman. One of the wounded was in a critical condition, hospital sources said.

   Turkey is fighting a long running separatist insurgency in the southeast, and the blast comes as the
government is trying to provide relief to thousands of people rendered homeless by a powerful earthquake in
Van, another largely Kurdish province.

    Sahin was speaking at a news conference in Van, where he was part of a team overseeing the relief effort.
