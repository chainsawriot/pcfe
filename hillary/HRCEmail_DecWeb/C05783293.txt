We are working the Euros on a GA product.                                                                              B5


Susan laid out pathway for consideration in SC. There will be various procedural elements almost every day next week.




Press is decent.

                                                                      Interesting idea.

Call with Jewish leaders went very well.

So far, not terrible.

Nides              doing call w Jewish leaders.




David did well in the backgrounder. Press skeptical but not howling.

Lebanese called for consults Monday so we're working on that.

All in all, it's solid. We're okay.

On other fronts things are pretty quiet. We're getting the GCC nonpaper together. Need to talk piracy at some point.
Will have a G20 secprez for you over the weekend or Monday.

Talked to him this afternoon. Alerted me he'd be on Fox Sunday and intends to support Mullen. I asked that he support
all of Mullen: don't forget need to keep engaged. Said he would but that we are "at a xroads with Pakistan."

I thanked him for the markup.
