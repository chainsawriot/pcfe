Panetta has an impossible schedule -- he can't do before Cabinet meeting as
                    . So unfortunately, we will lose that meeting this week Everything else will be rearranged.

That's right. you can get there 2:30 and be fine. Question is whether you want to ask                   to meet in the
morning.
Just talked to jake who reports you have agreed to go so we will start planning unless you tell us otherwise. As you
know, hague, westerwelle and juppe now saying they will go if you go.

Will add Marc and the service. Huma, correct me if I am wrong but the UN session technically begins at
3:00pm. Assuming we would want to arrive at 2:00pm for any meeting time prior, that would mean wheels up from
Andrews at approximately 12:00pm/12:15pm.
