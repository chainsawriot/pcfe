Subject: Somali militia: Suicide bomber was Somali-American (AP)

MOGADISHU, Somalia - (AP) Al-Qaida-linked Islamist militants in Somalia say one of the suicide bombers
who attacked an African Union peacekeepers' base in Mogadishu was Somali-American.
   The claim posted on Somalimemo.net, a website frequently used by the al-Shabab militants, could not be
immediately verified.
   Two suicide bombers and around 10 gunmen sparked a two-hour gunfight when they attacked the base
Saturday in the Somali capital. The extent of casualties remained unclear late in the day.
   The militants' short statement said the bomber was the second Somali American involved in a suicide attack
in Mogadishu in five months.
   U.S. authorities say around 20 Somali-Americans have traveled to Somalia to fight with the al-Shabab
insurgency.
