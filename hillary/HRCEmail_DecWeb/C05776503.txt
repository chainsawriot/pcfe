Here it is â€”
                                                         But what is most important by far is for you really to engage and
make it yours. It has a lot of great stuff in it, but too much, a reflection in part of the many great cooks we have in the
kitchen. USAID sent over all the new stuff for the development section. Bill Burns helped rewrite the diplomatic section,
although I think that still needs the most work. Jim and Jack both gave us overall comments. Jim in particular
emphasized the need, I think rightly, to demonstrate that as with the QDR, the QDDR is an initiative designed to figure
out what we need to stock up on today to have the right assets on hand for what we foresee as the problems and crises
of tomorrow. Hence the new top, but we can certainly go back to the old one. I look forward to your reactions and your
edits.
