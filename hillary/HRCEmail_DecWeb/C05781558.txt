Sorry I missed your call - I just left Dana Hyde's going away dinner and couldn't hear my phone.

Fairly quiet night in any event. Bill and I strategized on           tomorrow.            talked about how to deal with   B5
the USG funding controversy in Egypt - he's pulling together a stratcomm team on it.



Didn't   reachFâ€”bn Rothkopf but will tomorrow.
