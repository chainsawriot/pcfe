Thanks, Cheryl. Completely understood, and sorry to be a bother. It's really just a follow-up to their 2010 meeting and
an update. Kicking it down the road some is fine, to be sure.

Thanks again, and have a great weekend!

       Haller.

So now - with Iran and Syria and our challenges in frontline states is just so busy that I would just being unkind to
suggest we will get him in.

Is there a memo he can share and on which can be the basis for a future meeting down the road some?

Cheryl: Hi there! Do you think we might be able to try to give another shot to a brief meeting between Gen. Bolden
and the Secretary, please? I know you guys have been swamped and weren't able to make it happen last year, but he'd
really like to do it if at all possible anytime during the next few months. Any help making it happen would be most
appreciated, as always.

Thanks,

       Haller.
