Subject: Wes Clark on Libya

FYI. I have been in touch with Wes Clark over the last few days. He has had two Libya-related meetings. On Friday, in
Switzerland, General Clark saw "Sheikh Tamar" from Oman, a friend of Saif Qadhafi. On Saturday, in London, he saw
Mohammed Ismail, Saif Qadhafi's chief of staff who has been flitting around Europe (and is the one who's been in touch
with the Norwegians).

General Clark worked out his script with me ahead of both meetings. His bottom line for them both was the elder Q has
to go. From his descriptions of the two meetings, it sounds as though General Clark was extremely hard-hitting. But in
both cases, his interlocutors resisted the message, saying Q would stay in Libya but in an (unlikely) low-profile way.
General Clark would have none of it.

General Clark expects Mohammed Ismail, who he said starts his travel back to Libya tonight, will stay in touch with him.
General Clark will stay in touch with me if he hears from either interlocutor again.
