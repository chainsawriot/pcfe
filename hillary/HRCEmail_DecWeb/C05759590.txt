But the "system" let the Blues go public. What's to prevent the co-ops from incorporating down the road? The return of
non-profits would have to require no changes.

The problem is that Baucus circulated his plan Saturday morning, and his plan has included coops literally for months.
He started circulating paper that got to us Sunday. It's hard to move Baucus on anything new at this point, especailly
now that we're back to the hands off approach. And really, people are worried about non-profit insurance companies
being strong enough. After all, the old Blues became the current Blues - that has been a concern about coops too; that
is why the left has argued for a stronger government role.

But look our strategy just went 180 degrees in the course of 12 hours, so it could switch up again.

Why don't they go w non-profit insurance companies instead of cooperatives like the Old Blues?

So after being prepared to put out very long press paper, with a fully drafted bill (though still needing work) waiting in
the wings, the strategy has utterly shifted to going back to discussing health care at 30,000 feet tomorrow evening
because Baucus is moving. He will announce tomorrow he is marking up next week. They are thinking their push has
made him move so now it's counterproductive to lay out very specific details. The speech is being totally redrafted, and
I think we may just end up putting out a one-pager.

The Baucus news is close hold; as is, of course, all of this.
