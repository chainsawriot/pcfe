Dear Counselor Mills,

I will ditto Heather's sentiments and add just a couple more.

One of the unexpected joys of working in the Operations Center has been getting to see firsthand how incredibly hard
everyone on Secretary Clinton's team works. Your energy is infectious. Your dedication to your country, and to your
fellow man, is obvious. As a fellow citizen, and as a professional Foreign Service Officer, let me say how proud I am that
we get to count you as one of our own, and how privileged I feel to have been able to help you in your work.

You, Ms. Mills, are one of the good ones.

Take care, stay cool, and give a shout if you ever need anything. You know the number.

Sincerely yours,

J.T.

Dear Counselor Mills:

Ah shucks. Along with Ambassador Mull, you are our favorite caller, favorite bearer of cookies, and all-around favorite
principal. Thanks for helping make this year fun and rewarding. JT is off to Kabul and I'm moving just a few floors down
to the Burma desk. But I very much look forward to the day that I'm lucky enough to cross paths with you again.

Warmest regards,
Heather

JT and Heather

I don't know how my life will go on without you.

You both have been impeccable partners and I will remain forever in your debt for the enumerable times you made my
work and my life possible.

Please stay in touch and good luck in your next endeavors.

Best.
