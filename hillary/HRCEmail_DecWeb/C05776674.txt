The Virgin Mary?? Well, that's a claim to fame!

The week before the weekend of weddings I have to be at the UN General Assembly in NYC and I will not know whether
I have to work on Sat until that week



And pls keep me updated on all the Mayoral gossip. I can't tell yet whether Rahm will actually decide to run. So it will be
a wild ride the next few months.

As Roy Spence would say, Ride at Dawn (whatever that means!!)

Rahm rumors are everywhere. So is Tom Dart, the Sheriff, and a great guy. And, of course, every alderman, including
Danny Solis and MOC, Danny Davis. The tributes in my daily Herald (Arlington Hts based; 3rd largest circulation in the
State) had some very stirring tributes from suburban mayors. I believe we have had 48 years of Daley rule in Chicago.
How will this impact the Nov election?

O'Keefe to get the real scoop on what's going to happen. I am going to stream your speech this morning. It's
                        as well as the Virgin Mary's--not sure how old she would be. Love you. B

I'm in shock too. What reason did he give and who does he favor to succeed him? Pls share any and all insights into this
huge news ( as any real Chicagoan knows it to be!)

Mayor Daley just announce that he will not seek re-election. We're in shock.
