The Department of State has learned that members of the Iroquois Nationals Lacrosse Team may again seek a
passport waiver for travel to attend games outside the United States, including the 2011 World Indoor Lacrosse
Championship in the Czech Republic in late May. We want to help ensure that members of the lacrosse team
are able to participate in competitions worldwide. To that end, the Department stands ready to work
expeditiously to issue U.S. passports to those team members who are entitled to them under U.S.
law. Consistent with U.S. legal requirements for entry and departure from the United States, the Department
will not issue a waiver for this travel.

The Department acknowledges and respects the rights of the members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy as
well as their many contributions. As you know, over the course of the last year, senior officials from the
Department have met with leaders of your Confederacy to explain the legal requirements regarding travel
documents needed for entry and departure from the United States, the limits of passport waivers and that, given
the lack of qualifying circumstances for this travel, we would not issue another passport waiver for the
team. Given the desire of the Haudenosaunee to carry their own passports, we suggest that members who also
qualify for U.S. passports carry both a U.S. passport and a Haudenosaunee passport when traveling overseas,
which will avoid the unfortunate situation that transpired last year when the United Kingdom refused to honor
the passport waiver. Unfortunately, as we have advised, passport waivers are not generally recognized by other
countries.

The safety and well-being of travelers from and to the United States is our utmost priority, including working to
ensure national security by adhering to legal requirements for anyone entering or exiting the country. The
United States partners with the international community to support a safe, secure and standardized global travel
environment. A U.S passport facilitates secure international travel and also provides invaluable safety and
security for those traveling overseas, especially in times of crisis. It entitles the bearer to services and benefits

at U.S. consulates and embassies worldwide, including emergency services for victims of crime, evacuation in
times of crisis, financial or medical assistance, and travel document replacement.

We understand that some team members may already possess U.S. passports in addition to their Haudenosaunee
passports. As we have discussed in our meetings, we stand ready to assist those eligible members who do not
have U.S. passports. We can facilitate passport issuance on short notice at our passport agencies in Buffalo and
New York City.

The Department looks forward to working with the Iroquois Nationals Lacrosse Team to support their efforts
internationally. Please feel free to contact Jonathan Rolbin, the Passport Service's Director of Legal Affairs
(RolbinJM@state.gov or 202.663.2491), with questions or to assist you in any way we can.

Sincerely,



SBU
