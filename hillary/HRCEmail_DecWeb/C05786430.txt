Our friend, General Joe Ballard owns The Ravens Group. Our friend, General Johnnie Wilson, is on Ballard's
board... They do extraordinary work across govt agencies including full management of Walter Reid,
administrative work at NIH and management of facilities at the VA. They also do GSA work and DoD work...
They carry all desired statuses such as Service Connected Disabled Veteran, minority, etc...

The Ravens Group has a consistent and strong track record in government services.

I've sought to have the Gens meet Under Secretary Kennedy. I don't know if my requests have made it to him...
We know of specific opportunities State is seeking and we know that there are some timely opportunities, too.

You will see below some lower level work outreach that has taken place at State... But there are more
opportunities than just those mentioned below...

I'd love the opportunity for our Gens to come in for appropriate meetings, which seems to be Under Secretary
Kennedy. I think, while lower level outreach is going on, having this top level meeting would be invaluable for
State to know and be aware of a govt contracting group with the best possible scores, results, status and cost
saving measures...

I know Gens Ballard and Wilson would greatly appreciate your consideration in helping them share their work
and meet the right folks.

Thanks so much. B.

Good afternoon, Sir

It was a pleasure to speak with you today. Per our conversation, I am sending you this email with the details of the
opportunities that I have uncovered. I am currently working on some opportunities at the Department of State. I am

scheduled to meet with Bill Black at the Rosslyn office on the 25 th to discuss two separate administrative support
contracts that are scheduled to be released in October 2011 and March 2012 to place various skill sets. The re-compete
in October is worth $100 million, and the re-compete in March is worth about $160 million ($375 million ceiling). The
personnel provided will need to have a Secret clearance. The incumbent for the October re-compete is ARTI/Paradigm
Solutions. The incumbent for the March re-compete is Alutiiq.

I have also discovered a requirement for Facilities Management and Support Services which will include a total of five (5)
buildings at the Potomac Annex. This opportunity looks to be a new requirement. I am still gathering information for
this opportunity. The latest information received is that the RFP will be scheduled to be released October 2011. The key
contacts for the facilities operations for BRAC properties are Stephen Falsetto, Charles Mays, and Vincent Chaverini,
Jr. This requirement is coming out of the Bureau of Administration / Facilities Management Services, Office of
Operations (A/OPR/FMS).

I am looking forward to working with you.

Respectfully,
Dawn
