Cheryl

I met with Elizabeth Littlefield two weeks ago on PNB and cookstoves and they were very
creative and helpful. They had heard about the Monday am mtgs w the assistant secys, USAID
and MCC and wanted to know if they could attend. Elizabeth said that you had brought this
possibility up early in her tenure but she never followed up.

I think its a good idea. Do you want to proceed with it.

Thnx

Kris
