                 Draft reply to Jalili's letter of 14 February 2012



                                                            Brussels, March 2012


   H.E. Dr Saeed Jalili
   Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council
   Islamic Republic of Iran


   Thank you for your letter of 14 February 2012, in reply to my letter of 21
   October 2011.
   I welcome your suggestion to resume dialogue and your readiness to
   address the international community's concerns about your nuclear
   programme. The dialogue will have to focus on this key issue. It goes
   without saying that we remain ready to also address other areas of
   interest to you and to look into ideas you might put forward. However, at
   this stage, the main focus of our efforts will have to be on building
   confidence by developing concrete and practical steps.

   We remain convinced that initially we could work towards the shared
   objective to engage in a constructive dialogue on the basis of reciprocity
   and a step-by-step approach based on practical and specific suggestions
   for confidence building measures. In this regard, we remain committed to
   the practical and specific suggestions which we have put forward. We also
   recall our readiness to consider any proposals you might wish to make on
   your side. These confidence building steps should form first elements of a
   phased approach which would eventually lead to a full settlement between
   us, involving the full implementation by Iran of UNSC and IAEA Board of
   Governors' resolutions.
   Our overall goal remains a comprehensive negotiated, long-term solution
   which restores international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature
   of Iran's nuclear programme, while respecting Iran's right to the peaceful
   use of nuclear energy consistent with the NPT.

   I am also convinced that, on the basis of Iran's readiness to engage
   seriously and without pre-conditions in meaningful discussions on
   concrete confidence building steps concerning your nuclear programme,
   we will be able to open positive perspectives for negotiations and to make
   progress in efforts to take fundamental steps for sustainable co-operation
   which will allow us to overcome the existing deficit of confidence in the
   nature of the Iranian nuclear programme, and bring benefits for all sides.

   Therefore, looking forward to a sustained process of dialogue aimed at
   producing concrete results and in order not to repeat the experience of
   Istanbul, I would propose that we resume our talks at a mutually
   convenient date and venue as soon as possible.

   In practical terms, our deputies could get together in the near future in
   order to prepare for the first round of our resumed talks.

   Yours sincerely,




   Catherine Ashton
