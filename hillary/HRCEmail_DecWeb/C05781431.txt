Subject: RE: Calls

Okay - Ops is continuing to try to get times for Nafie. They have been unsuccessful in reaching him so far. I'll reach out
for times for Day right now. A couple of other new call items for you -
- Peter King is asking to talk to you today about Somalia. H is working up a call sheet for you. We will have it today.
- Bill Burns/Jake have a request for you to call Ben Cardin about Sergei Magnitsky. We're also getting a call sheet for you
on this - today.
- I put Mary Landrieu on your grid because she wants to discuss Guatemala. Lona has been unable to work out a
meeting time as we had hoped. Miguel sent up points for this call that will be coming to you.
- We also just got more information about the D'Amato/Somalia call that will be coming your way.
- I will send you and Huma new grid, too.

Ms-
Huma asked me to set up these 2 calls for you tomorrow morning (after your 730 am saakashvilli call):
1.  Sudanese First Vice President Kiir 2.   Mr. Nafie al Nafie, Assistant to President al-Bashir of Sudan

You should have the call sheets soon, if not already. (laura sent them to huma).
Because of the time difference, it may be early morning before we have confirmation on these 2 calls. Ill be sure to let
you know as soon as we have confirmation.
Also, we've been unable to lock in lavrov and al-faisal. Will keep you posted on any developments there, too (although it
seems unlikely for tomorrow morning).
-lauren
