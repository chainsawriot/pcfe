Fyi -




I am sure Terry briefed you, but the State Dept team of Kris B and his troops were amazing for                     B6
          So very sad and unnecessary - but all of us showed support tdiho was ever so grateful to you for your
supportive call. Terry's remarks at the Memorial were incredibly touch
