Could you and Kurt run the traps to see if we could mention this in the QDDR?

Kurt
I wanted you to know that the initiative the Secretary, ADM Willard and
we discussed at dinner here is well underway.
At ADM Willard's direction our Senior USAID rep and I have launched a
project to inventory PACOM, USAID and State activities in an initial
basket of topics and areas (LMI, Vietnam, Indonesia, Oceania and
education, engineering, maritime security) and to identify and exploit
opportunities for greater coordination. FYI, Secretary Clinton raised
the initiative again with ADM W and me during our chat on the tarmac
prior to her departure from Honolulu and ADM W committed with
enthusiasm. He subsequently reported his intention to SecDef Gates as
well. Secretary Clinton stressed to us the need to label the initiative
so that communications on the topic will capture our intent.

Intending to echo Secretary Clinton's use of 'forward deployed' to
describe diplomatic and develop efforts, as well as the three "Ds" of
the QDDR, we are calling our project "3Ds Forward".

With USAID and other agencies representatives already under my 'purview'

in my dual-hatted position as Director of Pacific Outreach (J9) my own
connectivity with USAID here could not be closer; we are all very
excited to have brought USAID's activities up to a level that garners
the Commander's personal attention. This is very new at PACOM and
portends progress for USAID-PACOM and State teaming.

We will look to build on existing ad hoc coordination with an eye to
identifying and institutionalizing best practices in support of all
three organizations' priorities in ways that can be easily modeled to
other Cocoms. Under our work plan we intend to brief initial results to
ADM Willard next month and to take advantage of opportunities such as
the Dec 14-15 USAID Asia Mission Directors Conference (Bangkok) and our
own PACOM Commanders Conference early in 2011. Of course, we will keep
you updated so that, as appropriate, you will be in a position to
demonstrate progress to the Secretary as we promised at dinner.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Our USAID rep at PACOM has advised USAID up to the
level of USAID Deputy Assistant Director for Asia. In order to assure
that more senior USAID colleagues are brought onto the team early, and
to prevent anyone later thinking we moved out with just two of the three
legs of this stool in place, you might consider alerting by email or
telephone call your appropriate colleagues at very senior levels of
USAID.

Thanks.
