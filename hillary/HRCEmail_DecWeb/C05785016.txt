Belatedly....this was really fabulous by the way. As was the speech at the Human Rights Council. I have an
asylum client from El Salvador who has been tortured since he was young because he is gay....her remarks
sent some hope his direction and sent some hope to tens of thousands of others. Congratulations.

Hope you are well. Miss all of you guys.

Cheryl,

Secretary Clinton gave a very strong speech in Busan. Revamping foreign assistance is an important feature of her
remarkable few years at Secretary of State.

When the administration came to office, Secretary Clinton immediately stressed the importance of leadership from
the Secretary and ambassadors on development issues. I was wary that this was just a new way of talking about the
chronic dominance of State over USAID, which has often made U.S. assistance suboptimal from a development point of
view. But events have changed my mind. For example, the leadership of the President and Secretary of State in
promoting agricultural development and best-practice nutrition assistance in poor countries has achieved much, much
more for hungry people than what USAID and the MCA have been able to do. Top-level political emphasis on hunger
and food have swayed the investment priorities of many other governments, multilateral institutions, corporations, and
NGOs.

I don't think the administration has received the credit it deserves for President's world hunger initiative (most people
think Feed the Future is just an agriculture initiative in USAID) or for your reform of how the U.S. carries out its

diplomacy and development activities. In the first months after coming to power, the administration supported an
expansion of World Bank and IMF lending to help developing countries cope with the financial crisis. There was no
publicity about it, but I think the Bank and IMF really helped the developing countries sustain rapid economic
growth. Even the low-income countries, as a group, are growing at 6% a year.

I don't think the administration has received enough credit for what you've done, partly because your achievements
have usually been presented and promoted one-by-one. Most people who know about Feed the Future, for example,
think it is just a program in USAID. Perhaps you should consider a speech by the Secretary that would summarize all
that the Obama administration has achieved in the area of international development and how it has benefited the
American people as well as struggling people around the world.

leaders, and a broad coalition of secular and religious organizations to protect international aid and the 150 account.
