           The recent events in the Middle East, particularly in Egypt, have riveted the world. Throngs of
           citizens have flooded the streets of Cairo, Alexandria, and other cities, demanding the resignation
           of Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's President for three decades. Last week, the White House deployed
           Ambassador Frank Wisner to Egypt as a special envoy in helping Mubarak's Administration reach
           compromise with the Egyptian public. Ambassador Wisner will be joining us at the Atlantic Council
           (1101 15th Street, NW, 11th Floor), on Monday, February 14th from 10:00am - 11:30, for a closed
           door, off-the-record session, to discuss his meeting with President Mubarak, his controversial
           comments about the transfer of power, his predictions about the future of Egypt, and regional and
           global implications.

           Ambassador Frank Wisner's diplomatic career spans four decades and eight American presidents. In
           addition to posts in Algiers, Vietnam, Tunisia and Bangladesh, Ambassador Wisner served as Secretary
           Rice's special representative to the Kosovo Status Talks in 2005 and as Ambassador to Zambia, Egypt,
           the Philippines, and India. He also served as Under Secretary of Defense for Policy and as Under
           Secretary of State for International Security Affairs and as senior Deputy Assistant Secretary for
           African Affairs from 1982 to 1986, a time of intense diplomatic engagement in Southern Africa.
