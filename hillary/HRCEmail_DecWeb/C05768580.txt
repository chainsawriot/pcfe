Thanks -- that is great. Rich Verma circulated to Jake and me a draft letter for Sec. Gates that reflects this framing-- we
are reviewing tonight. I also spoke with Randy DeValk in Sen Reid's office who was very frustrated with the budget
committee process and urged me to call Sens Cardin and Nelson, which I am doing.

He called Conrad and Spratt for DOD and made our case too. He is willing to send a letter tomorrow. He told me he
argued that Congress needed to look at our budgets together and if there is a freeze or cutbacks, it should be on "non-
national security discretionary funding." So, he wants to help.
