You are correct after further digging there were two additional QFR responses that were answered
very late: 1) the Kerry QFR from the March 2, 2011, Budget hearing and 2) another Lugar QFR from
the May 12, 2011 Feltman hearing.

Thanks — to be clear — this is different that what you share d with me, right?

I have from my notes that you indicated that there were 3 late questions for SFRC — Feltman (ques came Nov 2011;
response came 22Feb 2012 Durbin); Steinberg (ques came May 2011; resp came 22 Feb 2012 Lugar); Clinton (ques came
March 2011; response came Feb 2012 Lugar).

Subject: Late QFRs
Importance: High

Here is the list of QFRs that were completed and returned to the Committee since the beginning of
February which can be considered unreasonably late:

       1) Lugar QFR re: Libya - received May 12, 2011
       2) Lugar QFR re: Libyan oil resources - received May 12, 2011
       3) Lugar QFR re: Communication in between posts,•USAID and State - received March 2, 2011 (S
          Budget Hearing)

       4) Kerry QFR re: antiterrorism - received March 2, 2011 (S Budget Hearing)
       5) Durbin QFR on Syria - received Nov. 9, 2011

Our records indicate that there are no questions from the entire Congress that are
unanswered. Unfortunately, about 5 questions for SFRC Senators were answered very late, including
one from Lugar and one for Kerry from the last S Budget hearing.

I have asked the Senate Liaison office to print these off for you.
