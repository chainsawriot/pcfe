Here's his bio for quick reference:

He was a managing director of Warburg Pincus, a major global private equity firm headquartered in New York City,
between 1996 and 2009 where he served both as the firm's economist and as a leader in its international business, with
particular reference to Asia. In these roles, Mr. Cutter evaluated the financial and business sectors of a large number of
economies; assessed their capital markets; and considered the merits of specific investments within these markets.

Mr. Cutter joined Warburg Pincus directly from a senior economic policy role in the Administration of President William
Clinton. He has served with distinction during two Democratic presidencies: at the National Economic Council, from
1992-1996, during the Clinton Presidency â€” as director of the National Economic Council and Deputy Assistant to the
President; and at the Office of Management and Budget from 1976-1981, during the Carter Presidency, as Executive
Director for Budget.

Mr. Cutter also served as leader of the OMB transition team after the election of President Obama. From 1981-1993, he
was vice chairman and managing partner at Coopers & Lybrand, the global accounting and consulting firm that
subsequently merged with Price Waterhouse. In this role, Mr. Cutter managed a major consulting practice and was also
responsible for the over-all strategy of Coopers & Lybrand, a large, decentralized international business. Mr. Cutter's
central public policy interest has been the development and management of economic policy, and in particular the
issues related to economic growth, development, and the alleviation of poverty.

He has worked extensively with the World Bank; he is currently the Chairman of the Board of CARE, the global
development organization (where he has been a member of the Board for 13 years); and is a founder and current
Chairman of MicroVest, a leading global microfinance fund with assets under management now in excess of $100
million. In addition, Mr. Cutter is a member of the Governing Council of the IFMR Trust, in India, focusing upon market
based solutions to the problems of severe poverty in India.

Mr. Cutter holds degrees from Harvard University, the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University, and Oxford
University as a Rhodes Scholar. He is a member of the executive committee and immediate past co-chairman of the
Committee for Economic Development, the leading business "think-tank" in the United States; a board member of
Resources for the Future, an energy and environmental research institute; and a board member of the Russell Sage
Foundation. In addition, he is a member of the New York Council on Foreign Relations.
