Subject: Wikileaks - OSD/PA meeting with Michael Gordon of NYT

Per our SVTC this morning, here's a readout of the meeting we just concluded with Michael
Gordon of the New York Times:


             First NYT stories will appear on the Web Friday after 9pm, and will be in Saturday
edition.

•         Gordon said that NYT was not "the major news player" for Wikileaks, and that their
focus was much more on European publications

•         He said "there's nothing in there that changes his understanding of the Iraq War"
(he's writing a book on it)

             He confirmed the 5-6 themes we've been discussing that will be the focus of NYT
stories:

                o        More on civilian casualties than has been public so far

                o        More on detainee abuse than has been public so far

                o        Iranian involvement in Iraq

            o     More on contractors than has been public so far - although on this one, he
didn't seem like there would be any great surprises here

                o        A small report on the US hikers

 •            In addition, Gordon identified two others:

             o    The "surrender to the helicopter" issue, which is the focus of a story his
 colleague is working on -- and, apparently, the focus of other news stories (he said this a
 couple of times)

                     •     Kurdish-Arab tensions, and the US role in deconflicting those
                           tensions. Gordon said that for him, this was the most important topic

                    long-term - but he also said this will be of much less interest to
                    European papers doing stories

•         NYT has adhered to the process followed after their first meeting at the WH (when
the Af/Pak documents were released), and has gone to great efforts to redact names, as well
as information regarding force protection and intelligence

•          It's clear there are additional media preparing stories, including Le Monde and
UK's Channel 4. He made no mention of Al Jazeera.
