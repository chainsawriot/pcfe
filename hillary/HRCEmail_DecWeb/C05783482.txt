T hanks for the kind words. I think the Secretary's visit here was picture perfect given the chaos we labor under in
Libya.The Secretary was great and her efforts will I think help us move forward on our project to help the war-wounded.
On a lighter note, I will never be lonely here after the Secretary was kind enough to give my personal contact
information to all 120,000 students at the university during her stirring dialogue with them. It has been quite a week ;I
don't think I can take any more excitement. All the best, Gene.

Thanks so much Gene - you have been a terrific partner in a hard circumstance.

I think we will move forward with seeking to have Chris become charge in January and then
nominate him subsequently so he can begin serving.

Hi Cheryl: hope this finds you well. I know that Jeff has been in touch with you regarding the switch between myself
and Chris Stevens. I just wanted you to know that I am prepared to do whatever you and the Secretary think is best.
met with Pat Kennedy and Bill Burns before I left and told them
                                                       please rest assured that I consider myself extremely fortunate to
have had the opportunity to work closely with/for the Secretary during the past 8 months. I consider the Secretary's
visit to Tripoli this coming week to be the high point of my 30 year career. Warm regards, Gene.
