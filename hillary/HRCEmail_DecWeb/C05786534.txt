Hi Huma,

Per your earlier request, we'll need to prepare a memo to Nancy Powell for the Secretary's signature asking
that Jim receive the Distinguished Service Award, including a suggested citation. Is there anything in particular
the Secretary would like to emphasize? We could have it be something along the following lines:




or, I could pass to the speechwriters to come up with something.

I assume the Secretary will want to present the award at the event on the 20th; if so, we should probably look
to get this into DGHR by early next week so we can get it printed and framed, and the medal engraved.

Many thanks,
Steve
