                                      just informed me that Saleh departed Yemen on board his own presidential aircraft
and will be on the ground in Muscat in 30-60 minutes. The Yemenis have asked for clearance to bring the charter
aircraft to Oman in three days to bring Saleh to the U.S.

You can't make this up!
