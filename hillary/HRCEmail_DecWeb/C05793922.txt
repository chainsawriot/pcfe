Cheryl/Pat

This is probably already on your radar, but wanted to make sure I flagged.

Beth Jones was designated as Acting A/S for NEA on June 1 (the day after Jeff vacated the position). As I understand
it, under the Vacancies Reform Act, she can only retain the Acting title for 210 days unless a nominee is pending before
Congress.

Her 210 days will run up on December 28th but can be extended if someone is nominated when Congress gets back early
January.

I know this is odd timing given the transition. PPO has not said anything to me about this yet either.

I can speak with L about whether there is any leeway in extending the 210 days particularly given transition. Also I will
confirm that under the Vacancy Reform Act, if Beth's clock does run out, then Liz Dibble in her capacity as PDAS can
automatically serve as Acting if we want to go that route.

Thanks.
Heather
