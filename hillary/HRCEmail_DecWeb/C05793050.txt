Subject: Advance notice re a pending FOIA release likely to get press attention

Pat, Joyce and Peggy â€” I wanted to make sure everyone in my chain of command is aware of a declassified document we
are planning to release under FOIA, perhaps as early as tomorrow (Tuesday, 4/3) that is likely to get press attention and
about which Cheryl Mills is aware and has cleared on.

                                                                                                                              B5




Public Affairs already is aware of this pending release and will have a copy of the document and background information
as needed.

I wanted to be sure you all were in the loop on this now so that you won't be taken by surprise and were assured this
has been fully vetted, cleared, and planned for. I will let you know if for some reason this does not go out as planned.
