Jake;

Am wondering if you can help me flag for S
President Chinchilla will be the keynote speaker at the Georgetown University graduation ceremony on May 21. She
plans to be in Washington from May 18 — 21 but probably would try to accommodate77schedule if he were
available sometime close to those dates. Costa Rica - as you know - is a key ally and has not been getting a lot of
attention lately (given all the drama in the Central America Northern Triangle) so am hoping we can show President
Chinchilla some attention since she is coming to DC. A                      meeting would highlight the longstanding
commitment Costa Rica and the United States share to democracy and rule of law, respect for human rights, and
peaceful resolution of disputes. While a member of the UN Security Council from 2008 through 2010, Costa Rica
strongly supported U.S. positions in addressing crises in Georgia, Gaza, and other international hotspots. Consistent
with our objective of combating crime and drug trafficking in Central America, President Chinchilla is focused on
improving citizen safety and has devoted her own government's resources to this task with successful results — drug
seizures are increasing. President Chinchilla's other priorities are closely aligned with U.S. national interests -
innovation, entrepreneurism, and expanding environmental protection. We collaborate very closely on climate change
— Costa Rica has an ambitious goal becoming carbon neutral by 2021. Also, a U.S. firm — Ad Astra — is in Costa Rica
engaged in innovation. Dr. Franklin Chang, the U.S. astronaut of Costa Rican origin, is researching new technology that
uses scientific'exchanges and will hopefully lead to economic growth. Finally, bilateral people to people ties are very
strong — American citizens make up the vast majority of the one million tourists who visit Costa Rica annually and 50,000
Americans reside in Costa Rica. Thousands of Costa Ricans call the U.S. home and President Chinchilla is a Georgetown
alumna.

Let me know if this is something we can help move.
Thanks. Julissa
