Subject: Haiti SRSG update

Close hold
U/SYG/DPKO Alain LeRoy informed Mariano Fernandez today of the SYG's intention to appoint him as SRSG. LeRoy also
informed Brazil and Chile of the same today. LeRoy will inform the Haitians tomorrow. Barring any unforeseen hurdles,
the SYG will then undertake customary formality of informing the UN Security Council of his intention (probably on
Thursday), to be followed by UN's public announcement of the appointment on Friday or Monday. This time-line could
slip by a day or so, but wanted you to have visibility on latest I just learned from the UN.
Best,
Salman
