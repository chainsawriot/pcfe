Jake: I'd be very grateful if you would pass this to the Secretary and let me know if she's ok with it. Many thanks, and
best, Eric




Madam Secretary:




In light of what we've tried to accomplish in the QDDR process, and with Anne-Marie's strong support, I'm writing to ask
that you permit me to convey informally to colleagues at USAID your strong endorsement of regular meetings between
senior level State and USAID officials engaged in international humanitarian response — that is, myself and my team on
the State side, and the new USAID Assistant Administrator for Humanitarian Response, Nancy Lindborg, and her team,
on the AID side. USAID already supports this in principle, but our conveying your personal interest in this level of
cooperation would make a very big difference in ensuring implementation. It has been a very high priority for me to
enhance State/AID cooperation on these international humanitarian issues in many ways —joint overseas trips, joint
press conferences and published material, regular strategy meetings between our operations at all levels to ensure
smart division of responsibilities, etc. But creating a culture of collaboration is a challenge, and being able to convey
your personal interest in this level of cooperation would be extraordinarily helpful.




Many thanks.
