Latest from Bill B, who talked to Anne this afternoon:

Hearing apparently didn't materialize. Anne was called in to MFA following mtg that Tantawi held earlier today, and told
vaguely that GOE might want to engage directly on possible solutions at high level, quietly, outside Egypt. Will talk to
Anne                                Monday am to find out what (if anything) this idea might offer. One NDI guy refusing   B5
to come into Emb, others came in atter we talked to MKA and Ken yday. Otherwise, situation remains FUBAR.
