Voting is scheduled to begin shortly and a decision will likely be announced within the hour. Over the past 24 hours,
several wavering MPs appear to have come over firmly to Gillard. This is partially due to the realistuc assessment that
the contest needs to be resolved to avoid further damage to the Labor party. Best estimates are that Gillard is back to
around 70-32.
