LATEST DEVELOPMENTS
• (U) At 1655 EST WikiLeaks had posted 219 of what it claimed would be 251,287 cables. According to
WikiLeaks, the full set covers from December 28, 1966 through February 28, 2010 and originated from 274
embassies, consulates, and diplomatic missions. Of these cables, 15,652 are purportedly SECRET, 101,748 are
purportedly CONFIDENTIAL, and 133,887 are purportedly UNCLASSIFIED. WikiLeaks claims the most
frequently discussed subjects in these cables are external political relations (145,451), internal government
affairs (122,896), human rights (55,211), economic conditions (49,044), terrorists and terrorism (28,801), and
UN Security Council (6,532). (WikiLeaks)
• (U) Der Spiegel, The New York Times (NYT), La Monde, The Guardian, and El Pais published extensive
news articles and links to WikiLeaks documents beginning at 1300 EST. (WWG01/Ops e-mail)
• (U) The White House issued a statement at 1336 EST. (WWG01/Ops e-mail)
• (U) WikiLeaks experienced a short interruption of service around 1100 EST, claiming "we are currently
under a mass distributed denial of service attack." BBC ran the story under the headline "WikiLeaks Hacked
Ahead of Secret U.S. Document Release." It quoted WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange as stating that U.S.
authorities are afraid of being held to account. (BBC)

THE NEW YORK TIMES
• (SBU) The NYT release included a webpage that links to four articles and a purported cache of 18 cables.
Sunday articles focused on the frank nature of U.S. diplomatic reporting, Iran's nuclear ambitions, links
between Iran and Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), and activities by U.S. diplomats that the
paper said "blurred lines" between diplomacy and spying. The revelations in the articles are not limited to the
text of the 18 purported cables. They also invoke the content of alleged cables whose text has not yet been
posted on the NYT website. The paper posted 18 alleged cables, some with redactions, under three headings:
"Candid and Frank Assessments" (09 Tripoli 771, 06 Moscow 9533, 07 Harare 638, 07 Berlin 242, 09 Kabul
3068, 10 Kabul 693, 09 Tegucigalpa 645, 79 Tehran 8980, 89 Panama 8545, and 90 Cape Town 97); "Iran's

Nuclear Ambition" (09 Manama 642, 09 Brussels 536, 06 Abu Dhabi 1725, 09 Tel Aviv 1177, 08 Riyadh 649,
10 Riyadh 123, and 05 Abu Dhabi 2178); and "Diplomats or Spies?" (09 State 80163). (The New York Times)
• (SBU) EAP: As of 1530 EST, the NYT had not yet released any alleged EAP-specific cables. One article did
discuss U.S. relations with the Republic of Korea (ROK) and the People's Republic of China (PRC). On ROK,
it reported that USG and ROK officials discussed an eventual collapse of the DPRK. On the PRC, according to
the NYT article, contacts told Embassy Beijing of a Chinese Politburo-directed effort to hack into Google's
computers as part of a larger effort to sabotage computers of private U.S. firms and the USG, as well as the
Dalai Lama. (The New York Times)
• (SBU) SCA: NYT released two purported cables from Afghanistan related to readouts of meetings between
Senior Civilian Representative in Regional Command South Frank Ruggiero and Ahmed Wali Karzai. (The
New York Times)
• (SBU) NEA: The paper released eight purported cables from the NEA region, primarily focused on
engagement strategies on Iran and a portrait of Col. Muammar Qadhafi. Aside from the redaction of the source
name in 09 Tripoli 771, the NYT posted the cables in their entirety. The NYT claimed in its summary of 09
Tripoli 771 that the colorful portrayal of Col. Qadhafi was penned by Ambassador Cretz. The NYT also noted
the region's "mixed record" on counter-terrorism, citing support of al-Qaida from elements in Saudi Arabia and
Qatar's weak support for counter-terrorism initiatives. (The New York Times)
• (SBU) AF: The NYT released what it said were two cables on Africa. The first was a 2007 end of tour report
by Ambassador Christopher Dell, assessing the destructive economic and political policies of President
Mugabe. The second was a 1990 report from Embassy Pretoria with a prominent local lawyer on the behind the
scenes negotiations between the African National Congress (ANC) and the de Klerk government. (The New
York Times)

DER SPIEGEL
(SBU) In six on-line articles, Der Spiegel provides a glimpse of coverage to follow in this week's print edition
of the magazine and on-line. No specific cables are cited in this initial publication. The coverage presents an
image of the U.S. as a "superpower that can no longer be truly certain of its allies." It cites what it says are
cables relating to U.S.-Turkey relations that cast doubt on U.S. views of the Turkish government. A second
article presents unflattering portrayals of German Chancellor Merkel and FM Westerwelle. Finally, Der Spiegel
focused upon the "National Humint Collection Directive, which allegedly directs U.S. diplomats to spy on their
diplomatic colleagues. (Der Spiegel)

THE GUARDIAN
• (SBU) The Guardian posted the full text of what it said were 57 State Department cables and a number of
articles on their website under the headline "U.S. Cables Leak Sparks Global Diplomatic Crisis." The website
includes an interactive world map that allows a user to click on a country and access articles. Of the 57 cables,
50 mention Iran. All posted documents are marked SECRET or CONFIDENTIAL. None of the purported
cables appear to have been redacted. The website also links to data sets, including one that purports to provide
originator, date, and tags for all cables due to be released by WikiLeaks. (The Guardian)
• (SBU) One article, based on what it claimed was 2007 State reporting, addressed efforts to persuade Beijing
to block the transhipment of DPRK ballistic missile parts to Iran via the PRC. The Guardian released three
purported reports dealing with Africa, again without apparent redactions. Two were reportedly INR "reporting
and collection needs" in the Great Lakes region and the Sahel. The Guardian cited the reports as evidence that
U.S. diplomats were serving as intelligence officers. A third alleged report from 1990 dealt with challenges
faced by Nelson Mandela from ANC hardliners. (The Guardian)

EL PAIS
(SBU) El Pais published a full report of the WikiLeaks cables entitled "Major Historical Infiltration Uncovers
U.S. Foreign Policy." The report includes seven separate articles, a report on how to read U.S. diplomatic
cables, and an interactive "map of regional areas affected." No cables were published, but many were
referenced. The cover page includes pictures of world leaders with a quote taken from the cables. Photo

captions include — Putin "authoritarian and macho;" Sarkozy "following closely;" Hu Jintao "the fight for
power in Asia;" Chavez "attempts to isolate him;" Col. Qadhafi "a real hypochondriac;" and Berlusconi "his
wild parties." The separate articles do not focus on one particular region but offer wide coverage of Iran,
Venezuela, Argentina, DPRK, and the UN. One article was headlined: "Washington Orders Spying of the
UN." The article claims that Embassy Asuncion was asked to attain personal physical information of all
presidential candidates in 2008. Articles also address the Falklands/Malvinas conflict, Turkey, and Spain. (El
Pais)

LE MONDE
(SBU) As of 1500 EST, France's Le Monde had not yet published any alleged cables on its website. Instead,
the website features six articles explaining the background of WikiLeaks and the contents of some of the
purportedly leaked cables. The main article explains that 25 journalists from five countries collaborated in an
"unprecedented" manner to study the purportedly 250,000 leaked cables and determine which cables they
would report and which individuals' identities they would protect. The article also says that WikiLeaks has
agreed not to immediately publish on its website all 250,000 cables and instead would only publish cables used
by the five newspapers in their WikiLeaks reports. Iran is the geographic focus of Le Monde's November 28
articles reporting the contents of purported cables, but Le Monde specified that the main subjects to be covered
in upcoming reports involve primarily Europe, Russia, PRC, and the Middle East. Articles on Iran explain the
designation of U.S. embassy personnel worldwide as "Iran Watchers" and detail conversations between various
sources and U.S. embassies in several countries about Iran's internal government dynamics, as well as
conversations between Middle Eastern leaders and embassy personnel demonstrating some Middle Eastern
leaders' fear of Iran's growing military might. (Le Monde)
