Subject: S. Korea separates apology demand from nuclear talks with N. Korea: official (Yonhap)

SEOUL (Yonhap) - South Korea is willing to hold a bilateral meeting with North Korea on a nuclear-free
Korean Peninsula before resuming multilateral denuclearization talks, separating it from its adamant demand for
an apology over last year's deadly attacks, a senior government official said Monday.

The remark by the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, came after a flurry of diplomacy among
South Korea, the U.S., China and other regional players to reopen stalled six-party talks on the North's nuclear
programs. Improved inter-Korean relations are a key prerequisite for resuming the six-party forum which also
involves Japan and Russia.
