With luck - and this is not an area where we've had much - we'll bring the outcome of the back and forth into conformity
with the call sheet rather than the other way around. But will keep you posted.

Yes--9 is good. Will the call sheet reflect whatever the results of the to and from are?

There is much to'ing and fro'ing on the Israeli statement in response to the Q statement. As a result       proposes a     B5
call tomorrow morning, perhaps at 9? Huma has the call sheet.

Would that work?
