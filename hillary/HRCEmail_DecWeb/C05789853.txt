Dear Hillary,

A few meetings ago, we talked about how we — US companies and the USG - can help other countries develop
the shale oil and gas with hydraulic fracking in an environmentally responsible way. The responsible
development of these resources can change the energy and geo-political landscape in profound ways.

The DOE points of contact who can support State:

Chuck McConnell
Asst. Secretary for Fossil Energy
Charles.Mcconnell
Office: 202-586-6660
Cell:

John Duda
Director, Strategic Center for Natural Gas and Oil
National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL)

I am sorry to have taken so long...in part because I had to navigate through the "Texts from Hillary" web site
with an ultra-slow connection.




Cheers,

Steve
