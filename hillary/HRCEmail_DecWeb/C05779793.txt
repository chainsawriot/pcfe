I'm sorry that you keep having to deal with this. I'm confident that we are right on substance, that our programs are and
will continue to be effective at supporting people on the ground, saving them from real danger, giving them safe access.
We are about to distribute what will be the most competitive, cutting edge programming done for
democracy/development in the USG.

Dan
