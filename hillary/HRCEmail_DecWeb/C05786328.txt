MS -

Predictably,                   has asked for you to do the Sunday Shows to be the face and voice of the Administration         B5
on Egypt. We're in agreement that you should do, reinforcing your role as the President's chief foreign policy advisor,
and America's chief diplomat - but also in large part because someone else doing them presents problems for us by
undermining your position at a moment when Americans expect to hear from you.

 They're hoping you'll do all five. While that sounds onerous, we would pre-tape them all Sunday morning from a single
location, a single chair (pre-taping tomorrow doesn't work because of the fluidity of the situation), and they would be
limited to a hard five minutes each.

They could be done from your Chappaqua house or nearby before you leave for the airport, or they could probably even
be done from Andrews before we leave for Haiti. There are several scenarios Huma, Lona and I could come up with to
make it work without drastically re-routing you or adding significant time to an already long day. If you agree, we'll start
working through options to present to you.

Philippe
