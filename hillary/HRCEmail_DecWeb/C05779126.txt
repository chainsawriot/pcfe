(SBU)

A/S Feltman spoke with Senator Lieberman at approximately 4PM today. Sen. Lieberman called to convey his support
for POTUS and SECSTATE, whose public messages he said were "exactly in the right place," balancing support for change
and reform while refraining from public pressure on Mubarak to step down.

Lieberman noted with concern that public pressure from USG for Mubarak to step down would likely have very negative
ramifications among our allies in the Arab world. Also, he advised that we continue relative silence regarding our
assistance to Egypt as we need to avoid sending negative messages to the Egyptian military.

A/S Feltman gave an update on the day's events. He thanked Senator Lieberman and said he would pass the Senator's
words on to S and the WH.

Just heard from Sen Lieberman's staff. He's requested a call on the Egypt issue. His scheduler, Rayanne Bostick, can be
reached at 202 641 5870, and will connect the call to the Senator.

Thanks,
