Subject: Maternal mortality reduction

Cheryl,

Just a quick note to let you know that CDC is fully supportive of and committed to
accelerating the reduction of maternal mortality worldwide. Reducing maternal mortality is a
concrete expression of the Global Health Initiative linked to impact. I believe that real
impact is possible and now is the time for concerted USG action.

I am pleased that our staff have been a part of the design team, conceptualizing the
implementation model in a way that leverages the strength of the full USG and established
USG-supported platforms for efficient results. We have staff from across the agency
positioned to fully support this effort as well.

I am prepared to further mobilize significant relevant human and financial resources from
across the agency to help support the interagency Saving Mothers effort.

Thank you and I look forward to working with you and others at State on this transformative
effort.

I'll email you tomorrow with options for your visit here on the 23".

Tom
