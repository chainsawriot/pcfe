See below. Hopefully you can open the photos (the first boxes of Pak mangos have arrived in Chicago). And notice the
small request Mary Beth makes on behalf of her two partners in crime...

She is off the the NSC, to take half of Lipton's job. So she's still going to be an asset.

Jake-

Thanks for coming out on Friday. It was great to see you.

I mentioned mangos to you. Our first shipment arrive in the US last Thursday. This is one of the initiatives that the
Secretary announced during her October 2009 visit. It's been a major struggle getting the sanitary and phyto-sanitary
regimes in place but it's done! This season the price is high and supply is targeted to stores in New York and Texas, but
it will go down significantly next year and beyond.

I've attached three photos for you. The design on the boxes is a bit cheesy but I thought RCH would have gotten a kick
out of it. =) The Pakistanis renamed a plane in the PIA fleet for the inaugural trip which was unexpected but a nice
touch.

Anyway, I can't tell you how much time I've spent on this and RCH was quit immersed in the specific details of the
process as well. He brought it up with Zardari and others to press for action when things got jammed in the
bureaucracy. He liked to throw them off by getting into crazy minutia as well as the big strategic issues to show just how
much we were involved in.

My two partners in crime who lived and breathed this effort in the field were coerced early on by RCH and all they asked
for in return was an autographed picture of Secretary Clinton. Both are huge fans and RCH of course said "no problem,
just get this done!" I'm hoping that you might help me fulfill his outstanding promise to them?

The two individuals are: Marc Gilkey who is our regional APHIS rep based out of Embassy New Delhi. He's been SUPERB
at keeping USDA focused and a real miracle worker at finding solutions to the internal USG technical regulatory issues.
The other is Joe Carroll who just left post but has served as our Agricultural Attach√© at Embassy Islamabad for the past 2
plus years. Joe is moving on to Australia next but spent over two years patiently educating the GOP on the details of
the SPS issues.

I'm happy to help facilitate in any way and appreciate your help. It'd be nice to close this chapter with these folks
getting some well deserved recognition.
