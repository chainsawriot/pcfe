•     Upcoming High-Level Visits: We look forward to President Rousseffs visit to Washington and continue to
coordinate with the White House on dates. I understand that we are now looking at the possibility of the meeting
occurring during the week of April 9. We welcome the opportunity to meet with you in advance of or during her visit
and to work with the Brazilian Government on a substantive and productive visit that highlights our close economic ties
and outstanding cooperation in education and science and technology. Under Secretary Sherman is also looking forward
to her planned visit to Brasilia and Recife on February 2-4, and Deputy Secretary Burns is looking forward to his visit to .
Rio de Janeiro and Brasilia on March 1-2.

•     Issuance of a Visa to Yoani Sanchez: I would like to express our appreciation for Brazil's issuance of a visa to
prominent Cuban dissident Yoani Sanchez. Ms. Sanchez's efforts are just one example of the desire of the Cuban people
to freely determine their future, and your support is appreciated.




Background: December 3, 2011, marked two years of imprisonment for USAID subcontractor Alan Gross. He was
arrested on December 3, 2009, and in March 2011 sentenced to 15 years in prison for "crimes against the independence
and territorial integrity of the state" by a Cuban court, when in fact he was merely working to help connect Jewish
communities on the island to the internet. Gross is an international development worker who has worked in more than
50 countries over the past 25 years. We believe strongly that Gross was wrongly convicted and his continued
incarceration serves as a major impediment to U.S.-Cuba relations. Given that Brazil's substantial ($750 million)
investment in the Port of Mariel is in part motivated by anticipated future trade with the United States, the
Government of Brazil should have an interest in seeing an improvement in U.S.-Cuban relations. Brazilian President
Rousseff's stated commitment to human rights, and her past personal experience suffering human rights abuses and
imprisonment by an authoritarian regime, may make her more receptive to humanitarian arguments favoring Gross's
release. Cuban government interlocutors may compare this imprisonment to the Cuban Five. We reject all attempts to
link the two cases.
