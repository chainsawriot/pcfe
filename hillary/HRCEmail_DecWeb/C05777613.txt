Simoes called me back after talking with Patriota. President Rousseff still has not decided if she is departing Sunday or
Monday for Argentina, but has asked Patriota to brief her on Sunday morning. Given this schedule, Simoes said that
Patriota would not be able to meet the Secretary in Haiti. He said that Patriota regrets not being able to take advantage of
this opportunity, but looks forward to seeing the Secretary in February.

It looks like this won't happen, which I regret. However, if possible, a call from the Secretary to Patriota before she departs
would be a good thing.

Cheryl:

I spoke with Simoes and passed on the message regarding the Secretary's trip to Haiti.

He noted that Tom Adams had mentioned the trip and asked whether or not Patriota might be able
to travel to Haiti with the Secretary. At the time, Simoes said, he had declined saying that Patriota
would be travelling with the new President to Argentina. However, Simoes told me that there is now
a chance that the Brazilian President will not travel to Buenos Aires until Monday morning, which
might open up the possibility of Patriota joining the Secretary in Haiti.

Simoes asked, "Please find out if the Secretary would still like Patriota to accompany her, and when
she plans to arrive. If it is early enough, Patriota might be able to fly up and fly back on Sunday."

Simoes is still in Washington. He departs tonight. When I called him, he had just finished a meeting


Let me know what I can tell Slmoes.
