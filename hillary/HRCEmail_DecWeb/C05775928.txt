I spoke to Chris a few minutes ago.

He will stay until 13 Aug (fri nite).

He is assuming Jeff will still come on weds.

Chris -- is there any possibility of you staying until August 12?                                                             B5
                                                                                    It seems to me that, after 34 years and   B5
particularly after the last awax months, it would be fitting and appropriate and useful for you to be in the Embassy chair
                                  Undoubtedly Ray will be there. But it's been you and your team who have been doing          B5
the heavy lifting in terms of government formation.                                                And the media should       B5
highlight you as the Embassy participant, not Stu or me or anyone else. Could you consider staying two more days?
-- Jeff
