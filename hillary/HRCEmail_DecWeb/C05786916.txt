Subject: AU: Gunmen have attacked AU base in Somali capital (AP)


MOGADISHU, Somalia - (AP) A spokesman for the African Union force in Somalia says gunmen have
attacked one of their bases in the Somali capital.
   Lt. Col. Paddy Ankunda says the gunmen tried to enter the base on Saturday but were stopped by AU troops.
He says the gunfight was still going on and casualties were unclear.
   Resident Mohammed Abdi says he heard several large explosions near the base but it was not clear what
caused them.
   About 9,000 AU troops are in Somalia supporting the weak U.N.-backed government against al-Qaida linked
al-Shabab insurgents. The AU and government control almost all of the capital but the insurgents still launch
daily attacks.
