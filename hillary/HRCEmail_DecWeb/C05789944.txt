Dear Senator Whitehouse,

First, let me add my personal condolences. Ms. Colvin was a remarkable person, whose courageous and compassionate
reporting touched the hearts and minds of many. Her death is a great loss.

We are actively working with our Polish Protecting Power in Damascus, as well as with the French and British Embassies,
the Syrian Red Crescent Society, and the Lebanese Red Cross, to arrange for the recovery and repatriation of M.
Calvin's remains. Our Embassies in Beirut, Amman, London, and Paris are all engaged in this effort, and we are in
contact with Ms. Colvin's family. We expect more information today and I will certainly keep you informed.

All the best,
Michelle

Dear Senator Whitehouse:

Please also let me express my condolences.

Our Consular Affairs staff has been in touch with Ms. Colvin's family,



We have been working with the Polish Embassy in Damascus, which is representing the U.S. as our Protecting Power to
recover the remains.

Michelle Bernier-Toth, who is one of our top senior officers and Managing Director of the Department's Office of Citizen
Services, would be glad to speak with whomsoever you designate to keep you abreast of our efforts. She can call that
individual or she can be reached at
202-647-9018 or at Bernier-TothM2@state.gov

I have spoken to Michelle and she and I will assist in any way we can.

Sincerely,

Pat

Patrick F. Kennedy
Under Secretary for Management

Marie Colvin, the American reporter who was killed in Syria today, was a close college friend.

                                                                                                 Can you let
me know?
