Unfortunately, I take a negative view of the Internet in this respect. The Internet tends to amplify and empower voices
at the edges and is a difficult space for moderation and to achieve compromise. We've seen it in our own (American)
politics where it has strengthened the edges, the net roots on the left and the tea party on the right, while punishing
those trying to find common ground as accommodationist. This is partly why so many of our candidates are getting
pushed to the poles --- these voices and movements on the Internet are forcing constant purity checks.

In my view, the only way non-violence could be organized in the cyber space btw adversaries and influence
decisionmakers is if the citizens of the countries in conflict are ALREADY strongly averse to violence, and the Internet
then creates a transnational bond working in opposition to their respective governments. I don't know that this is the
case with either Israel or Iran ...

Enjoyed yesterday. What do you think of efforts like this? Even if dismissed as naïve, can non-violence organize in the
cyber space btw adversaries and influence decisionmakers?

I look forward to seeing you tomorrow. The following is amazing — it's from Global Voices, which is a very respected
community of global bloggers run out of Harvard. I have sent it to Alec as well. Would be v impt if messages like these
could be translated into Farsi/Hebrew, which State might be able to help with. It might also be worth thinking about
how/whether there is a way for different groups of Syrians to make themselves heard. AMS

  IRANIANS
   we will never bomb your country




A message of love from Israelis to Iranians sounds stranger than fiction in these tense years where Iranian and
Israeli governments threaten each other with any imaginable words.

But we see examples of just this in a Facebook campaign launched by Pushpin Mehina (real name Ronny) in his
timeline that says: "We will never bomb your country. We love you."




 piebadges zon-1/2524170         Israel considers Iran a potential nuclear threat to its existence. Meanwhile
Iranian leaders claim that their nuclear program is peaceful, but also call for Israel to be wiped off the map.

Both Israelis and Iranians are now uploading photos of themselves with the logo saying either "Iranians We
love You" or "Israelis We Love You" and it has attracted the attention of Israeli media.

For several people it is the first time they have communicated directly with either. an Israeli or Iranian, and some
Iranians voiced fears of repercussion from their government.

"I never met an Iranian"

Ronny from Tel Aviv in Israel writes:

To the Iranian people
To all the fathers, mothers, children, brothers and sisters. For there to be a war between us, first we must be
afraid of each other, we must hate. I'm not afraid of you, I don't hate you. I don't even know you. No Iranian
ever did me no harm. I never even met an Iranian... Just one in Paris in a museum. Nice dude... I see sometime
here, on the TV, an Iranian. He is talking about war. I'm sure he does not represent all the people of Iran... If
you see someone on your TV talking about bombing you... be sure he does not represent all of us. To all those
who feel the same, share this message and help it reach the Iranian people.

A message from an Iranian lady says:

Hi Pushpin, I am an Iranian lady. I just saw your warm and beautiful message to my country mates. Reading
your message brought tears to my eyes and warmness to my heart. Just wanted to ensure you, we all Iranians
feel the same, we just want peace and beauty on the earth, we hate war and slaughter, we all are the parts of one
body and it hurts when you see a human suffering since she or he is a part of your soul. I have been always
curious about you guys if you hate us, because I have been sure that the actual face of Iranians would not be
introduced to you guys... All in all, just would like to thank you for your beautiful message and say that we all
love you because you are our brothers and sisters. The only thing that matters is your beautiful heart not your
culture, language, skin color, religion or homeland.

It seems this campaign is offering a real connection between Iranians and Israelis to share a message we can
only dream for: love and peace in the name of mankind.
