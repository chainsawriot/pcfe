Yes, this is the game plan we hope to execute.

Dear Cheryl & Jake,

The Secretary had a very good conversation with                         yesterday. He has agreed to gracefully step           B6
aside, and the Secretary has asked me to work on a few things to help facilitate a smooth transition. These are listed
below.

                                                                                                                          5
                                                                                                                          6




Finally, the Secretary feels very strongly that     be handled with great dignity in this process. He is understandably       B6
disappointed, but is too much of a professional not to do the right thing. He has given us a very graceful way forward,
and it would be great if the White House could assist us in this transition.

Best,
Kurt

Dr. Kurt M. Campbell
Assistant Secretary of State
East Asian & Pacific Affairs
