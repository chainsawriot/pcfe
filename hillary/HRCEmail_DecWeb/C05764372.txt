Subject: Samoa

                Attached is DoD's response to our ExecSec, essentially saying that they are prepared to
         transport the goods to Samoa only on a space available basis under the terms of the Denton
         Program. If that is not adequate, DoD suggests that State (AID) pay for the goods to be
         transported commercially. Unfortunately, this evening's conference call with Congresswoman
         Richardson did not go well and it seems clear that neither she nor Representative Faleomavaega
         think DoD's proposed solution is adequate. The question for us is whether we try to go the
         Denton Program route, recognizing that it could take weeks and will not satisfy the members of

      Congress involved, or if we look into the cost of using commercial carriers. I'm told that
      Congresswoman Richardson is expecting an immediate response from us as to what we are
      prepared to do. (I propose that we let her know we just received DoD's formal response and
      are considering next steps.)



               Here is Kin's readout of the conference call with Congresswoman Richardson:


In a conference call this evening with State, USAID/OFDA, and DoD, Representative Laura Richardson and two staff
members of Representative Faleomavaega expressed frustration with perceived delays in approving airlift of
humanitarian items donated by California residents to Samoa. They noted that Secretary Clinton had told Congressman
Faleomavaega earlier that she was prepared to help gain approval for the air mission, but "bureaucratic red tape" was
delaying the flight. During the call, DoD Disaster Assistance staff had briefed on the status of the request for milair
transport, indicating that Secretary Gates was expected to soon make a decision on one of four options he was given,
including DoD and State funded missions. The option that DoD recommended is called Denton Amendment Cargo. This
provision allows for humanitarian goods to be airlifted by DoD on a space available basis to the disaster stricken areas
depending on the availability of aircraft. Both Rep. Richardson and Faleomavaega's staff balked when they heard the
Denton option would not be timely and would transport the goods only as far as American Samoa, leaving private or
State funding to pick up the remaining costs to transfer the items to Samoa. The Representative and Hill staff insisted
that the Secretary call DoD to strongly urge them to fund a direct flight to Samoa or that she take independent action
and direct that the funds from OFDA accounts be released to pay for the airlift. We agreed to forward their request to
the Secretary's staff and promised to update them tonight on developments.

Subsequent to our phone call,
                               We understand that under Denton, the next possible flight to Pago Pago would depart
California one week from today. Overall, the conversation was polite, but at times grew heated when our Hill colleagues
expressed frustration over disagreements between State/USAID and DoD over how to make the flight
happen. Representative Richardson was adamant that the materials be airlifted soon and stood ready to call the
Secretary, if necessary. Faleomavaega's staff fully agreed.
