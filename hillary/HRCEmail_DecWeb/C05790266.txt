Once we have the real # (which we had counted once before for Myers's piece to be just short of 600 a/o 12/31/11), it's
my mission today to ram this down his throat. And I'm guessing there are a lot of unhappy secretaries and cabinet
agencies.

Just finished reading. I don't think you get on the visitors log unless you are going to a state dinner, or an event at WH.
No one logs you in when you walk in daily for NSC meetings and Oval. But will check.

He has a ridiculous column purporting to report the number of times cabinet members visited the WH during the last 3+
years. Pls go thru my schedules and count my visits to refute this and correct record.
