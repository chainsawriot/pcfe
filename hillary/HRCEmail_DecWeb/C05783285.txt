Subject: Palestinian Authority President Addresses UN General Assembly (SBU)

(SBU) Abbas indicated the Palestinian Authority is ready to immediately return to negotiations if Israel agrees
to a "complete cessation of settlement activities." Abbas said his effort to obtain recognition of Palestinian
statehood at the UN are not aimed at delegitimizing Israel, but rather Israeli settlement activity. Following the
speech, crowds gathered in Ramallah chanted Abbas' name, according to press. The Office of Israeli and
Palestinian Affairs comments both the content of Abbas' speech and his delivery of a letter requesting full UN
membership tracked with expectations.
