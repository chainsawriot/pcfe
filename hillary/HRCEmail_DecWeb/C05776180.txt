This was an email anne patterson sent to a large group which was flagged for me. Some suspicion that they wouldn't be
able to get it together in time. We agree we see where things stand monday. This all the info we got.
From anne:
The Foreign Secretary just called to say that the President of the GA had agreed to hold a special plenary session on the
Pakistan floods. (This is actually a big deal in UN terms during the General Assembly.) He asked, "Could Hillary
attend?" This could be a good lead in to an event we were considering at the GA, which would be attended by Raj Shah.
