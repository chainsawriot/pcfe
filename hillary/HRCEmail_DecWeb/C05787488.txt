Subject: Congratulations on Libya intervention

Ms. Mills,

Please pass on my congratulations to Secretary Clinton for what was apparently her key role in persuading the
Administration to act to protect the people of Libya.
                                   With all the demand on USG humanitarian resources,




Hugh Parmer
