Philippe, please send this along to Secretary Clinton.

Madam Secretary,

We can't get a word in edgewise this morning because all of our 4-Stars won't stop talking about how much
they enjoyed your presentation yesterday. You really wowed them —with your substantive knowledge of their
areas of responsibility, your humor, and your personal connections to so many of them (Odierno, McRaven,
Mattis, et al). I don't think we've ever had a Secretary of State that is as close to the Combatant Commanders,
Joint Chiefs, and Service Secretaries as you are, Ma'am.

We also loved the way you ribbed General Schwartz about the airplane friggin's maintenance
problems. Welcome to our world. On our last flight home from Chile, we had to ditch our vaunted 747 —the
one that's supposed to protect us during a nuclear war — for a C-17. It was a l000ng flight.

Take care, and on behalf of Secretary Panetta, thank you again for helping make our day yesterday.

For me, I'll be tamping down hallway chatter this morning about who might make the best next SecDef

Jeremy Bash

The Special Assistant to the Secretary of Defense
