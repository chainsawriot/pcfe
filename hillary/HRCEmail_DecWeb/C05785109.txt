PA will do its usual amplification of both tonight and Monday's. We were/are hoping Nicole Gaouette will do something,
that's tbd. I tried Gail Collins, no luck. Caroline's been in touch with all the women's magazines and people who focus
on the issue to put it on their radar, and both the Elle & More reporters doing pieces on you were there (and coming
Monday).



But to be completely frank, most reporters haven't been interested because they think you giving a women's speech is
not novel or infrequent, so tonight's didn't stand out - especially without the NAP being on the table.

Hopefully once the NAP is out, we'll have more luck.

Are we doing anything to amplify it? Did we target any reporters for a piece about it and the one on Monday?
