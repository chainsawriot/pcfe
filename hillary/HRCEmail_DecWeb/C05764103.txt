This is really out of my lane, so I'll shut up — and Philippe knows much more about what will generate press than I do. I
just thought the Brookings speech is a good follow-on to the CFR speech and I like her getting out there first as Sec of
State and also on Iran, as her earlier remarks on Iran have already been dominating the news cycle.
