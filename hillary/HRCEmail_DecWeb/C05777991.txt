                                           REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT
                                          ON THE SITUATION IN EGYPT

                                                 State Dining Room


6:33 P.M. EST


     THE PRESIDENT: Good evening, everybody. My administration has been
closely monitoring the situation in Egypt, and I know that we will be
learning more tomorrow when day breaks. As the situation continues to
unfold, our first concern is preventing injury or loss of life. So I want
to be very clear in calling upon the Egyptian authorities to refrain from
any violence against peaceful protestors.

     The people of Egypt have rights that are universal. That includes
the right to peaceful assembly and association, the right to free speech,
and the ability to determine their own destiny. These are human
rights. And the United States will stand up for them everywhere.

     I also call upon the Egyptian government to reverse the actions that
they've taken to interfere with access to the Internet, to cell phone
service and to social networks that do so much to connect people in the
21st century.

     At the same time, those protesting in the streets have a
responsibility to express themselves peacefully. Violence and destruction
will not lead to the reforms that they seek.

     Now, going forward, this moment of volatility has to be turned into a
moment of promise. The United States has a close partnership with Egypt
and we've cooperated on many issues, including working together to advance
a more peaceful region. But we've also been clear that there must be
reform -- political, social, and economic reforms that meet the
aspirations of the Egyptian people.

     In the absence of these reforms, grievances have built up over
time. When President Mubarak addressed the Egyptian people tonight, he
pledged a better democracy and greater economic opportunity. I just spoke
to him after his speech and I told him he has a responsibility to give
meaning to those words, to take concrete steps and actions that deliver on
that promise.

     Violence will not address the grievances of the Egyptian people. And
suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away. What's needed
right now are concrete steps that advance the rights of the Egyptian
people: a meaningful dialogue between the government and its citizens,
and a path of political change that leads to a future of greater freedom
and greater opportunity and justice for the Egyptian people.

     Now, ultimately the future of Egypt will be determined by the
Egyptian people. And I believe that the Egyptian people want the same
things that we all want -- a better life for ourselves and our children,
and a government that is fair and just and responsive. Put simply, the
Egyptian people want a future that befits the heirs to a great and ancient
civilization.

     The United States always will be a partner in pursuit of that
future. And we are committed to working with the Egyptian government and
the Egyptian people -- all quarters -- to achieve it.

     Around the world governments have an obligation to respond to their
citizens. That's true here in the United States; that's true in Asia; it
is true in Europe; it is true in Africa; and it's certainly true in the
Arab world, where a new generation of citizens has the right to be heard.

     When I was in Cairo, shortly after I was elected President, I said
that all governments must maintain power through consent, not
coercion. That is the single standard by which the people of Egypt will
achieve the future they deserve.

     Surely there will be difficult days to come. But the United States
will continue to stand up for the rights of the Egyptian people and work
with their government in pursuit of a future that is more just, more free,
and more hopeful.

     Thank you very much.
