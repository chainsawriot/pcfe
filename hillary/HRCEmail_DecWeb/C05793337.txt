Cheryl,

I just got off the phone with Dr. Kissinger, who had been traveling in Europe. He asked me to inform you that he likes
your proposal and wants to conclude an agreement before HRC leaves office. Yale will also need to be part of the
negotiations,.but we are working together closely.

He does not wish to bother HRC - when she has much more important matters to deal with - but will call her later when
things settle down.

I do not know what the next steps are, but he asked me to call you immediately so we can get started on the agreement.

I am pleased that we are making progress.

Also, let me add my personal thoughts about the tragedy in Libya. I did not have the honor of knowing Ambassador
Stevens, but I worked in L for over eight years and know how the Department deals with these losses. It is terrible, but
the Secretary did a superb job of representing (and being) the finest America has to offer.

Best regards,

Jeff
