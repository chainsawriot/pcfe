Got it. Thanks. Skepticism endemic in sectors of Intel and military because of Bush hangover. I'd have Panetta or Blair
inform Congress and have it reported. Let them stand on the intel. Understand public discussion of scuds from diplomatic
standpoint. Provocative of Iran, foolish of Syria, yet changes nothing strategically. And, of course, if Bibi were to have
engaged Syria in negotiations taking its previous gestures seriously...

Going to London on Sunday for election. Gordon widely seen as schlemiel after "bigot-gate" episode. He's become a
classic comedic straight man. I expect a bucket of paint to fall on him next time he opens a door. Still he maintains his
dignity. Funny and sad and affecting all at once. Spectacle aside, the chance of a hung parliament looms. Have been
talking to Jonathan, et al, having dinner with him next Tuesday, and generally making the rounds. (Tony says in private he
would have won--easy to say but probably true.) Will report. And after election will write you something about Europe, UK,
etc.

Skepticism not in order.

Pat Lang on the Syrian scuds below...



 If Lang's skepticism is in any way credible then... Making public statements by

 acknowledging unsubstantiated intel is not exactly solid; if disproved or never

 proved, one is revealed to be hollow. How about analysis first, and citing

 authority of CIA, putting it on the spot, before very possibly lending credence

 to a disinformation operation? Does Israel need reassurance on its own claims

here? Unless this is part of a larger diplomatic movement that involves serious

pressure to come soon on Israel. Otherwise, back to square one, making

statements without evidence and disclosing that the Obama administration is

spooked by the Israeli inspired propaganda campaign against it involving

everything from ads signed by Eli Weisel to statements signed by Harry Reid, et

al, encouraging more of same. Unless of course you actually have the intel

nailed down. Cheers, Sid

 ""If these reports turn out to be true, we are going to have to review the full

range of tools that are available to us in order to make Syria reverse what

would be an incendiary, provocative action," Assistant Secretary of State

Jeffrey Feltman told the House Foreign Affairs Committee last week, moments

after making a strong pitch for the first U.S. ambassador in Damascus since

2005. Administration officials have suggested that the Scuds may not have

reached Hezbollah in Lebanon; in that case the strong statements may be

preventative. What is known for sure is that Syria has facilitated the transfer

of thousands of rockets and missiles to Hezbollah since 2006 in blatant

violation of the U.N. resolution that ended that summer's war in Lebanon. So why

persist with the "engagement" policy? "President Assad is . . . making decisions

that could send the region into war," was Mr. Feltman's answer. "He's listening

to Ahmadinejad. He's listening to Hassan Nasrallah. He needs to listen to us,

too.""



"If these reports turn out to be true..."

Well, are they or aren't they? Israel asserts that Syria has transferred some

of these old, liquid fueled ballistic missiles to Hizbullah to drag around in

the hills, fiddling with the dangerous fuel and oxidizers. What would be the

point? Hizbullah is already in possession of a large and effective collection

of short and long range rocketry.

Israel is an interested party in this matter. Are we to take their word for it?

What does US intelligence say of this?

This Hiatt editorial quoted Jeffrey Feltman a lot. Feltman's bias is clear.

Why is he still at the State Department as Assistant Secretary for the Near

East? Don't we need a new ambassador in Iceland?          pl
