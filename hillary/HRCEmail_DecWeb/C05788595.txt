I am SO grateful that after asking you into this thing that it went well and that you were pleased(I know it was a lotta
travel and a quick turn-around). I had dinner w: Bellerieve last night. He was describing his own emotion @ your part of
the event from his own civil servant perspective. Its so deserved. I'm very proud that JP got to play a part in honoring
you and the minutes, hours, days weeks and years you've given. Bellerieve also said that when he was PM, you made
them do things they didn't know they were capable of. That's pretty good stuff :). Again, thank you, and please also
thank the Secretary for me(I will do so directly as well). Talk soon-s.

I didn't know how much my life was missing until I met you.

I have always had to be my own hero - thank you for lifting that burden and being mine.

Congrats on a great nite for Haiti.
