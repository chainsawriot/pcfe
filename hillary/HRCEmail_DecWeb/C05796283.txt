Subject: Annan Deputy Says Syrian Regime Now Willing to Implement Ceasefire

Kofi Annan's Deputy Nasser Qidwa just spoke with A/S Feltman to share that JSE Annan
received a new letter from Syrian FM Muallim that said:
      1. The regime is willing to cease all military action in all of its territory by 0600 hours
          local time (1300 EST) on 12 April.
      2. The regime reserve the right to respond proportionally (supposedly the first time it has
          agreed to this) to any attacks
      3. Will redeploy its forces to certain encampment areas and bases, particularly in the
          governates of aDmsscus, Horns, and Hama.
      4. Request updates from the JSE on his efforts with the "other parties" (i.e., opposition).

Qidwa admitted that this may all be a trick or ply to prevent a Russian rapprochement with the
UNSC, but said the letter was more straightforward and factual than making excuses. He
thought it could represent a new political position, rather than just another tactic. A/S Feltman
remained skeptical. Qidwa admitted that, assuming this was true, there were still two schools of
thought within the JSE office with respect to monitoring: some wanted to have a ceasefire in
place ahead of time, others (like Qidwa) believe that monitors could help improve things on the
ground even if things were still "messy." The letter apparently made no reference to shabiha or
other security elements, which Qidwa admitted was a problem.

We will a more in depth readout on the high side, but wanted S to have this before her G8
meetings.
