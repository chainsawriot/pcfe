Madame Secretary....

I want to share some good news....and Tom is looking forward to seeing you on Monday in Haiti....


On Friday,       Ex-Im announced a fourth-straight record breaking year--as we topped $35 billion in new
authorizations. Since 2009, the bank has created or supported nearly 1 million quality jobs, including 255,000 this
fiscal year alone. I am particularly proud of our small business financing, which rose more than ninety percent from
$3.2 billion in FY 2008 to $6.1 billion in FY?12. Our support for women and minority owned small business
exporters was one of our faster growing market segments with loans up almost 17%. Key growth markets for the
past year include the UAE, Australia and Mexico.

It is a testament to the hard work of the Bank staff and the American exporter that we are three-fourths of the way
towards meeting President Obama?s goal of doubling exports. I am extremely proud of the work we do here at the Bank
and will continue to promote and advance the President?s agenda in any way possible.
I have included below the press release we sent out today.

Best,
Fred
