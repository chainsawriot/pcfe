Hi there. Wangari was an early star at CGI. Can you let them know, thanks, also don't know if you or the Secretary ever
had a chance to meet her. An amazing powerhouse. Take care, GS

Subject: Wangari Maathai passes away

It is with great sadness that the family of Professor Wangari Maathai announces her passing away on 26th September,

2011, at the Nairobi Hospital, after a prolonged and bravely borne struggle with cancer. Her loved ones were with her at

the time.



Professor Maathai's departure is untimely and a very great loss to all who knew her - as a mother, relative, co-worker,

colleague, role model, and heroine; or who admired her determination to make the world a more peaceful, healthier,

and better place .

 Prof. Wangari Muta Maathai started the Green Belt Movement in 1977, working with women to improve their

 livelihoods by increasing their access to resources like firewood for cooking and clean water. She became a great

 advocate for better management of natural resources and for sustainability, equity, and justice. A synopsis of her life

 and work can be read here.



 Prof. Maathai leaves her three children—Waweru, Wanjira, and Muta—and a granddaughter, Ruth Wangari. They are

• truly very grateful for all the prayers and support they have received.



 Further information on how Prof's life will be celebrated, where to share memories and condolences, and how to join us

 to build her legacy for generations to come will be provided shortly.
