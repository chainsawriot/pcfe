Dear Team

Brett McGurk,                                                         is in the building today and tomorrow to step
through meetings and paperwork. If you have not and are not on travel, would you reach out to him to see if you might
be able to find a moment to visit with him.

Sharon Hardy is escorting him around.

Best.
