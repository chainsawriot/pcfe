Thanks. Minister Smith (according to Kim) is the most cautious on the Aussie side and wants to move carefully given

He told me

(1) how important it was that POTUS come to Australia (and how disastrous it would be if he cancelled again) and that
they would arrange whatever fit the White House's needs, even buying more from us if needed.

(2)they couldn't agree to "permanent" bases but would agree to our troops "coming in and out." I said I was sure we
could work out something. But, we'll have to try to describe what is. acceptable to us before AUSMIN.
