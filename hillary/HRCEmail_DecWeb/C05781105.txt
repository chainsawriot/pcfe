Jake,
A heads up to you and S that we are going out to our lEA partners today to get support for a coordinated release of
stocks from various national oil reserves. In some cases countries don't have reserves or will not do it -- but at least we
want their verbal support. Obviously this is very close hold.

I wanted you and S to know in case you have any questions.

We are working with DO              on an outreach strategy -- but only 2-3 people in each agency are involved to avoid       B5
leaks.

Will keep you and S informed as we learn reactions from others -- but several countries are already lined up to
participate.

Bob

PS. Will be meeting with Dan shortly on S's Econ Speech. B

I think it makes sense for you to sit down with Dan.

Hi Jake,
I have spent several hours over the weekend going over the speech.

I think the structure and basic thrust are very good. I have made a number of suggestions that I think will give it a bit
more focus and sharpen up a few key themes.

You mentioned getting together on monday to review it, which I am happy to do. Or alternatively I could sit down with
Dan one more time toward the end of the day and he could make some edits and we could meet with you later in the
week. I am happy to do it either way.
Regards,
Bob
