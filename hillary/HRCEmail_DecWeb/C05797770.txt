Subject: Update on ISAT

Cheryl,

Hope you are well. A quick update on ISAT:
   - Held a call with the ambassadors this morning to get everyone on the same page about the process
   - Cable went out to the bureaus involved and our colleagues at DOD
   - Following several calls from Tom, DoD has staffed 3 of the 5 teams and we should have names for the remaining
       2 teams in the morning
   - All desks have been alerted to the need to expedite visas for the traveling teams and we will make calls as
       needed

We'll continue to keep you updated on progress. Please let us know if you have any questions or suggestions.
Kind regards,
Al
