Seas still very high

AFRICOM confirms sailing not feasible

Could be a long as 18 hours before seas calm

All aboard safe with plenty of food and water

Ship has been reprovisioned

Also seeing if we have any additional pax that we can round up and get libyans to allow onboard

As bad as this sounds airport reportedly a mess, thousands stranded there, riot police suppossedly had to intervene, and
several europeans airlines cancelling flites

Will advise of any changes

Regards

Pat
