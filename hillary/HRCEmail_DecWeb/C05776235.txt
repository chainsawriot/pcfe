If it's set to o Thursday am, I think it would be good if you could wait and leave Thursday afternoon if that's ok. And stay
                 longer next week if you want.

Quick update on the ME:
                                                                                              Dan Rubenstein is seeing
Abbas in the morning to nail down the Palestinians.
       I have everyone aiming for a Thursday am announcement here in DC.




Now to more important topics â€” me J. I had been intending to take off tomorrow afternoon, Thurs, and Fri to
                                                        I can push it back a day to depart Thurs afternoon, or I can
help shepherd things remotely tomorrow night and Thursday morning.
