MS:

Caroline Adler is working on getting the copies of More Magazine. I will follow up with her.

As Huma already replied, the Women in World DVD is in train; Monica and I will work on securing a copy of the Cameron
luncheon speeches.

As for the archiving project, I am making steady progress on the binders, and am up to April 2010. At this rate, I will be
compiling the binders in real time come late June/early July. Lona has been working on updating the schedules on her
own. I have offered to help her in the past to no avail, but understand, per Huma, that we are now telling Lona that we
have to expand this to a group project. I am confident that we can add this step to my routine for each binder and still
stay on track to get caught up to real time by this summer.

-Rob
