FYI
We are good with the Senator, maybe even a stronger relationship. Too bad he is leaving before we can reauthorize.

                                Lugar OK's Transfer of AIDS Relief Funds

         U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Member Dick Lugar has removed his
         objections to the U.S. State Department transferring $250 million from.the President's
         Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) to the multilateral Global Fund to Fight AIDS,
         Tuberculosis, and Malaria.

         "As part of the International AIDS Conference, I have had to opportunity to visit with a
         number of key players in the fight against HIV/AIDS including Bill Gates, our PEPFAR
         Coordinator Ambassador Eric Goosby, Global Fund General Manager Gabriel Jamillo,
         Global Fund Chairman of the Board Simon Bland, UNAIDS Executive Director Michel
         Sidebe, former PEPFAR Coordinator Ambassador Mark Dybul, and US Executive Director
         of the ONE Campaign Tom Hart," Lugar said.

         Last month, Lugar told Secretary Clinton that he was concerned about the State
         Department's proposal to transfer $250 million from the bilateral PEPFAR program to the
         multilateral Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. "My biggest concern
         about the transfer was the shortfalls this may cause in our bilateral efforts to compact
         HIV/AIDS. The leaders I met with this week expressed their confidence that the money is a
         worthy investment, and given their strong leadership I have decided to lift my hold on the
         transfer funds," Lugar said.

         "HIV/AIDS relief, in the form of programs such as the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS
         Relief (PEPFAR), has a history of bipartisan support. It is important for these programs to
         continue with support from both Republicans and Democrats. Additionally, as we continue
         the important work to eradicate HIV/AIDS, we must engage the youth of the world through
         various social media platforms to combat this disease."

          In 2003, under the leadership of Senator Lugar as Chairman of the Foreign Relations
          Committee, Congress passed, in a bipartisan manner, the PEPFAR which was
          reauthorized, with Lugar's support, in 2008. He continues to be an ardent defender of
          funding for the program. Lugar was also the author of the Assistance for Orphans and
          Other Vulnerable Children in Developing Countries Act of 2005 and he continues to fight
          for HIV/AIDS funding to serve these children.
