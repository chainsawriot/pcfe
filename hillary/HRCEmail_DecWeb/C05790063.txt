Jake: I see S is meeting with head of SOCOM this week. As he may well bring up issue of MIST (Military
Information Support Teams), I wanted to share with you an exchange I had with Bill and Wendy about it in
February,                                                                 There will be a para in her briefer on it,   B5
but given sensitivities not all the sharply expressed views below, which she should be aware of.

Thx.

Bill, Tom, Wendy —

I wanted to provide some context to Jim Miller's note regarding the MIST program, which is a subject I have
discussed previously with Bill. As background on MIST, I have attached the 2010 DOD memo which fairly
       UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05790063 Date: 12/31/2015

clearly lays out its origins and objectives. MIST (or MISO in the attached note) is the renamed version of what
used to be called psyops; the program continues to be run by SOCOM and, although DOD personnel under
MIST are offered to posts under COM authority, SOCOM sees this effort as a means of conducting information
operations in areas of strategic interest to them.

I am a strong supporter of whole-of-government efforts. EUR has worked hard with DOD to ensure that our
policy in Europe overall is reflective of Administration priorities and is fully integrated. And as I made clear to
Jim, I am not in a position to comment on the utility or advisability of deploying MIST in other parts of the
world; I certainly don't question the value — to take one example from the attached memo — of programs urging
civilians to report insurgent activity in Iraq or Afghanistan.
                                                                                                                      B5
