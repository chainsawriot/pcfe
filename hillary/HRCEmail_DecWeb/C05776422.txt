                                                      — Reason: 1.4(B), 1.4(D) — Declassify on: 01/15/2036
Update from Embassy Paris:

Sarkozy's Mid-East Advisor Nicolas Galey just told us the French will announce their initiative for Lebanon between
about 4pm and 5pm Washington time, despite the fact that Syrian President Asad has not/not yet agreed to participate.

Galey said he had just received the fax from Liz Sherwood-Randall and was on his way to meet with Sarkozy Chief of
Staff Claude Gueant to discuss the announcement.

As to Egypt, we re-emphasized the importance of their inclusion in order to create the necessary balance to make the
contact group effective. Galey indicated he had heard the same from Washington directly but could not yet confirm the
final French proposal for the group's composition.

He said the announcement tonight will be general, designed to confront Asad with a fait accompli while still enticing him
to join. The Syrians are not enthusiastic about the initiative, Galey acknowledged, but they promised a response
tomorrow. Galey thinks the Syrians are trying to buy time and doubts the French will in fact receive a clear answer from
Damascus by tomorrow.

Best,
Jamie
