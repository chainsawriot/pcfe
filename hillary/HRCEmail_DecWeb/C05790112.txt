Met Amb after Def Min visit this morning and stressed three points: (a) S very appreciative of professionalism of MFA
counterparts throughout whole affair; (b) we will try to keep things relatively quiet here, although we can't control Chris
Smiths of world; and (c) faster C's can process and approve application for foreign study, better for all.

Z said he understood, and would reinforce with capital. Added that his impression is that colleagues in capital want to
move quickly on application.

                                                                                                                              B5

Thanks.
