Fyi --- we have found another opportunity for Maureen.

She will continue to reside in SRAP, but couple her work on refugees by working with Lois on maternal mortality issues in
Af/Pak. Lois and Marc will be sending you a draft position description describing Maureen's role.

Thx

Maureen,

I was delighted with our meeting today. You ask all the right questions and will make a tremendous difference. While
you are travelling consider how you would like to get started and announce this. Let's meet that week.

Yours,

Lois

Lois, I spoke to Marc who is very enthusiastic about my working with you on the Maternal Mortality issue. He thinks it is
important and dovetails well with the SRAP development goals in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The only issue now is timing
which we can focus on when we both return from our trips.
I am really looking forward to this project. Best - Maureen
