Subject: POTUS visit to El Salvador

Hillary:

I met with Eduardo Stein, former Vice President of Guatemala and head of Truth Commission for Honduras, quality guy,
who reports that POTUS trip to El Salvador and the decision to make it solely a bilateral meeting is receiving a negative
reading in the Central American region. Stein states that the US's "favorite treatment" to El Salvador also extends to
supposed preferred treatment in financial and political support to that country. Stein interprets that this is creating
unnecessary bad feelings in the region. Primarily he was referring to Guatemala, Costa Rica and Honduras.




Best,
Maria
