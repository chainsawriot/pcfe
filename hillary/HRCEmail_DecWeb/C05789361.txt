          Herâ€¢ Excellency Lady Catherine Margaret Ashton
          High Representative of the European Union
          for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy

          Your Excellency

          I would like to thank you for welcoming my proposal I raised on 6th of September 2011 "to
          start talks in direction of taking fundamental steps for cooperation' In your fetter of 21't of
          October 2011.
          As it has been mentioned in Islamic Republic of Iran's proposed package of 2009 and in the
          letter of 8th of May 2011 and 6th of September 2011 as well, we voice our readiness for dialogue
          on a. spectrum of various issues which can provide ground for constructive and forward looking
          Cooperation.
          We welcome the assertion in your letter that you made on "respecting Islamic Republic of Iran's
          right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy consistent with the NPT". No doubt that by
          committing to this approach, our talks for cooperation based on step by step principles and
          reciprocity on Iran's nuclear issue could be commenced. Constructive and positive attitude
          towards Islamic Republic of Iran's new initiatives In this round of talks could open positive
          perspective for our negotiation.
          Therefore, within this context, I propose to resume our talks in order to take fundamental steps
          for sustainable cooperation in the earliest possibility in a mutually agreed venue and time.


          Sincerely yours,

          Saeed Jalili
          Representative of the Supreme Leader and
          the Secretary of Supreme National Security Council
          of the Islamic Republic of Iran
