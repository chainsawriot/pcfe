The White House is sending Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on an assignment — and this one's domestic.

Clinton will be joining President Obama's jobs council at the State Department on Friday for a talk that the
administration says is centered on "foreign direct investment in the United States."

The foreign angle is what hooks Clinton in to the discussion, which will include acting Commerce Secretary
Rebecca Blank and three members of the jobs panel: GE CEO Jeff Immelt, Kodak chief Antonio Perez and
UBS President Robert Wolf. But the talk about jobs is a marked shift for Clinton, who has spent the majority of
her time as secretary of state globetrotting and building up relationships with other countries.

Clinton's appearance with three members of a committee that advises Obama on the economy could renew talk
of her political ambitions. Clinton's future has been a subject of great speculation since losing the Democratic
primary to Obama and becoming his top diplomat. But she has claimed that she doesn't want to return to
politics, and she has denied a report that she wants to be the president of the World Bank.

On Friday, Clinton and the jobs council members will talk to "business leaders" at the State Department, the
White House says.

"Investments by foreign-based companies as well as increasing domestic investment create well-paid jobs,
contribute to economic growth, boost productivity, and support American communities," the White House said
in the statement announcing Clinton's participation.
