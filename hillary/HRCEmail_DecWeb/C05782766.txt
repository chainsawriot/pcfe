Subject:                            "Agenda"



Below are the agenda items for our meeting. They aren't organized in priority order, and this list is not exhaustive, but it
is a useful guide for the conversation. Where a particular person might be on the hook for an update, assessment, or
recommendation, I identify that person in caps.

If this works, I'll circulate it.
