Two separate groups (foreigners, amcits) en route to the airport. They will rendezvous at a hotel near the airport
because of traffic in town and hold there until given the final order to proceed. A lot could still go wrong but it looks as
if the names are being removed from the exit control list. Press is in the vicinity of terminal four, where our plane is
parked.

I gave Lorne an update when he called a few minutes ago.
