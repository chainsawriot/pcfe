Huma â€” It's not much more to go on, but Ops added that Mullen's staff hinted the call would be related to his impending
departure in two weeks. If you or Jake glean any further details, please let us know and we'll task out a call sheet.

Colleagues,

Admiral Mullen is available both Saturday (9/24) and Sunday (9/25) at the Secretary's convenience. Unfortunately,
