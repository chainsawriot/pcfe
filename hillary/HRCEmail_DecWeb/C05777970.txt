Subject: Cairo Update midnight Friday

All personnel at the Embassy compound are accounted for and will remain through the night in safe haven
area. Egyptian military have established checkpoints outside the compound perimeter. In coordination with
RSO, DATT, and Ministry of Interior officials the military units appear to be making progress on restoring
control of the roads adjacent to the Embassy. Preliminary assessment is that 23 USG vehicles have been taken
from the Polish parking. We are unable to assess other physical damage to facilities. One Embassy vehicle can
be seen on its side burning on a side street. Guard booth at the north parking lot has been gutted by fire, booth
at one drop arm has been damaged. There are a number of burned police vehicles in the area. Police remaining
around the Embassy are demoralized and extremely tired. Some appear to be under pursuit by protestors.

The number of protestors moving into the main square of the city is increasing notwithstanding the curfew and
deployment of military forces. Sound of gunfire is ongoing.

We have been able to contact and account for all but 9 U.S. Direct Hire employees via landline phone calls or
checking on residences. Efforts to ascertain the whereabouts of those we have been unable to contact are
ongoing.

RSO reports seeing protestors armed with AK-47's and there is gunfire being exchanged between military and
protestors. We also have credible reports of gunfire from Embassy residents in Maadi. Looters have been
observed in Maadi as well as burning of stores and vehicles. Earlier in the evening a large group of protestors
were trying to get to the Israeli Ambassador's residence near the main Maadi police station.

Senior Mission staff in our residential neighborhoods spent time before nightfall contacting families and
checking on mood which appears to run the gamut. Many are understandably jittery giving sound of gunfire
and sighting from balconies of fires and looters. As circumstances permit on Saturday we will explore other
ways of convening mission employees and family members to convey information and assess morale.

One consular officer at the Embassy and seven from their homes are fielding calls from concerned U.S.
citizens. We are advising U.S. citizens to remain safely in their homes or hotels. Most U.S. citizen concerns
center around lack of internet access and potential airport closures. We are not aware yet of any Amcits injured
in today's events.

Five private Amcits have taken refuge on the Embassy compound and are in the safe haven area.

Due to communication limitations we are unable to provide any reaction to President Mubarak's speech. Once
mobile phone and interne access is restored, post will make every effort to reach out to wide range of contacts
for an assessment.
