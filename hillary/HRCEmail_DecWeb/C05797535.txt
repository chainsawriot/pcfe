Subject: Awards

Cheryl, Heather Samuelson suggested that I add                             for Distinguished Service Awards and
              for a Superior Honor Award. I've revised this Awards Memo to do so should you agree? Also, for planning   B6
purposes, I will need to write nominations and move them through the Department-wide Awards Committee in the next       B5
week or so. Any thoughts on which ones I can certainly get cracking on? Also, does S want to do an awards event? And
finally, do you want to do something public for the Chris Stevens Award?
Thanks Jen

                                                                                                                        B5
