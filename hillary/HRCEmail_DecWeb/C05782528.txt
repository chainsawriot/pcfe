Went pretty well. Relatively big turn out (Cardin, Lugar, Tom Udall, Casey, Menendez, Shaheen, Coons, DeMint, Risch,
and Lee).

We planted a North Korea question with Cardin, enabling Wendy to take the issue off the table at the outset and taking
some of the wind out of the sails of would be critics.

Several questions on UN Palestinian statehood vote. A couple of questions on enduring Iraq troop levels, questions no
doubt provoked by today's NYT front page article.

DeMint's was the most confrontational, asking her if she subscribed to the administration's "philosophy of
appeasement." She actually answered it pretty well, saying engagement and strength are not mutually exclusive. In the
end, DeMint fell flat; got several emails from folks saying they thought her answer was great. Frankly, was a little
surprised DeMint gave her the opportunity to clear the air and address that at her hearing.

Finally, on Palestinian statehood, Rogin reported that Wendy got out ahead of the administration on veto of a UN
resolution on Palestine in the Security Council. We spoke to Toria who thought it was fine.

As I expected, no questions about clients, lobbying or any of the other red herrings.

Here's the aforementioned Rogin piece:
