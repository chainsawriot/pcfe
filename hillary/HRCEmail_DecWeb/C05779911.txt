Subject: Great job!

Heather, you did a fantastic job in putting together the delegation to UN CSW. I've been with the talented group the last
few days and they truly make us proud. We have been hearing plaudits from all who encounter them and they've been
brilliant on all the panels on which they've participated. I've never spent so much time before with scientists and
techies!(Even USG Bachelet said, "You have so many great women astronauts.!") They're all so excited to be engaged on
the issues that they want to do more! This is a model delegation. Thank you for all the work that went into selecting it.

Best,
Melanne
