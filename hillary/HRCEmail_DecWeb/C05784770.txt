Subject: Nigeria legislation

Dear Counselor Mills and Under Secretary Otero,

I just wanted to give you a quick heads up/update about the very concerning legislation working its way through
Nigeria's legislative branch right now. The legislation—which, among other things, would criminally penalize witnessing
or participating in a gay marriage ceremony, participating in LGBT advocacy organizations etc—has passed the Senate
and is in the House, where it could pass at any time. It would then go to President Jonathan's desk for signature.

I chaired a call this evening with colleagues from AF, DRL, G staff, S/P, and USAID to identify what we've done so far and
potential future action we might take. One idea

              We are working to put this and other potential actions on paper, a draft of which we will have done
tomorrow.

No need to reply to this-- Given the Secretary's speech last week, I just wanted to update you in case there is breaking
news. We will keep you posted.

All best,
Dan
