  MEMORANDUM TO CHERYL MILLS
  Date:    March 9, 2012
  Subject: Candidates for Membership to the U.S. National Commission for UNESCO

  The U.S. National Commission for UNESCO is a State Department federal advisory committee
  that supports worldwide humanitarian development and values by coordinating efforts and
  delivering expert advice from federal, state and local governments and from the NGO
  community on issues of education, science, communications and culture.

  Appointments to the Committee are made by the Secretary. This year, the Secretary can appoint
  up to 16 members from the NGO community, 12 state and local representatives, 3 federal
  representatives, and up to 8 members at large.

  Below is a list of recommended members comprised of recommendations by both WHL and IO.
  All have been vetted by WHL. I included information that came up in select vets below as an
  fyi, but do not believe any to be disqualifying. If you approve of this list, we will move foward
  with processing their appointments.

                       Recommended Members for Appointment for 2012

  NGO Community (13)
