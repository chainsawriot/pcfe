Thanks —good timing as I was about to send 3 to 4 candidates to Kris and Lois for initial interviews for the faith-based
role.

Also, unfortunately I am striking out on the 4 individuals S wanted for UNGA —                     declined given timing,   B6
       has not returned my call or email, and within the past week an issue arose with                      so I did not
reach out (can give you further details next time we meet). I'm not sure if you/S want to re-visit    in this role, but
wanted to flag.
