Subject: I spoke to Jack

Secretary Clinton,




I just spoke to Jack and wanted to say that while I am quite sad about this news I will do whatever Jack needs to support
a transition these next few months. Knowing what I went through in transitioning from USDA, I understand this will
mean changing my allocation of time in order to help our team succeed.




On a personal note, I want to say that Jack and I have been doing weekly breakfasts that I found invaluable. He is an
incredible person and a wonderful role model — as we all know but I have learned more recently — and I will miss him a
great deal.



Raj
