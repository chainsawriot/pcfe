Seriously! Facts are facts.

So no one called to yell at me. But I heard there was consternation by some. But others recognized it for the truth it was.
I mean, at some point we can't bend to some unreality - they ran a negative campaign plain and simple.

And a few former campaign staff emailed me to thank me for telling the truth. That was gratifying.

Miss you Hillary.

Well, the truth can hurt, can't it?

I hope it doesn't cause you any problems, my friend.

Subject: new yorker piece on Obama

I have a tough quote on the Obama campaign against us in the primary in the piece. I'm sorry if this creates any
problem. But I was asked a factual question (in a public forum), and I answered with the reality that I saw. Below is a
link to the page my quote is on.

Hope you're well, and my again my apologies if this is a problem.
