Alonzo,

As you may know, Representative Faleomavaega has been urging USG assistance in facilitating the transport and
delivery of humanitarian relief items that were donated by the Samoan American community in California to disaster
stricken areas of Samoa. Mr. Faleomavaega has been in touch with the Secretary about his request for DoD aircraft to
supply the airlift and she agreed in principle to Department assistance. In accordance with our normal procedures, our
EAP bureau drafted an ExecSec memo to DoD requesting milair assistance on a non-reimbursable basis. As a routine, we
seek OFDA clearance of these memos to ensure full coordination. Indeed, DoD considers OFDA concurrence as an
important factor in its final determination.

                ISo you can see we are at an impasse and we hope that you may be able to help us tomorrow when we
try to move the fully cleared ExecSec memo to DoD for action.

The attached memo with talking points was sent to the Secretary tonight in the event Congressman Faleomavaega, who
arrived in Samoa over the weekend, placed a call to the Secretary about the airlift request. We understand the
Secretary asked that PM A/S Shapiro reach out to Faleomavaega on her behalf to discuss technical issues with his
request, further indicating, we assume, that she would like to make this happen.

We can discuss this further tomorrow if you need more background. We very much appreciate your help...all the
best...km
