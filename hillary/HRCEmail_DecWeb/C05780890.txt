Reid floor staff telling us that it's extremely unlikely nominations will move today. Too many unresolved

I did not commit S to a call.


Thanks.

She will do a call if she needs to AND it will yield desired result so she is not calling cold.

Am told the DeMint hold may be resolved. Haven't gotten confirmation but working on that.




Thanks.
