 Subject: RE: stepping back to look at Egypt




 It is difficult for Embassy Cairo to weigh in at this point on thelonger term issues. The GOE has seemingly lost control of
 areas of Cairo--including area around Embassy--and it is not clear how quickly, or if, they will be able to restore order.
 President reportedly ordered Military to reinforce the Embassy, but we have seen no evidence of it yet._
