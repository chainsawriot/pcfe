MS, Claire and I are going on a tour of the CIA this morning (along with a few folks from Stratcomm) and cannot bring our
blackberries/cell phone so will be off line until 12:15pm or so. Bernadette is here if you need to track us down in the next
few hours. One call note from Claire â€” Tom Nides called for you earlier, not urgent. Thank you!
