The Secretary's Call Sheet for Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal

Purpose of Call: To express your condolences following the death of Crown Prince, Deputy Prime Minister, and Minister •
of Interior Naif bin Abdulaziz.

     Expression of Condolence: I am truly sorry to hear of Crown Prince Naif's [NAI-yif] passing. He was a dedicated
public servant and a true partner in our joint efforts to combat extremism and promote stability and security in the
region. His contributions as Crown Prince and Minister of Interior have been invaluable to these efforts. We will sorely
miss his partnership and advice, and my thoughts and prayers are with you and your family.

•   Delegation: We are now in the process of assembling an official delegation to personally pay our condolences to
King Abdullah and the Saudi people and government. Our Embassy will be in touch with more details. We would
welcome any guidance on the right time for the delegation to come to the Kingdom.

Background: On June 16, Saudi Crown Prince Naif bin Abdulaziz passed away in Geneva, Switzerland, where he had
gone for medical tests. The official announcement did not name the cause of death, but he was known to have suffered
from multiple illnesses, including heart disease and diabetes, and associated complications. His body will be flown back
to the Kingdom on June 16, with funeral prayers performed after sunset on Sunday, June 17 at the Grand Mosque in
Mecca. The funeral will likely be followed by a three-day period of official mourning beginning June 18. The Allegiance
Commission, convened by King Abdullah, will then meet to discuss Naif's successor. Minister of Defense Salman bin
Abdulaziz is widely expected to be named the new Crown Prince. King Abdullah will also need to appoint a new Interior
Minister.
