Cheryl,
I know Rick has touched base with you already, but just wanted you to know that so far it's gone much better than we
anticipated. We have done HACFO, SACFO and SFRC, and Monday will do the HFAC.
We have some follow up homework to do, especially with SACFO, and will be meeting with H tomorrow to discuss our
rapid response strategy. But just wanted you to know that our pal was a star (as you knew he would be, very good call
on getting him in on this right away).
Best,
Karin
