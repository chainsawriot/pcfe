DCC seeks more US assurances before restoring NATO supplies

Media: Pakistan Today

Byline: N/A

Date: 18 April 2012

ISLAMABAD - The Defence Committee of the Cabinet (DCC) late on Tuesday decided to put on hold reopening
of the supply routes for NATO troops stationed in Afghanistan as civil military leadership agreed that the
announcement would only be made after an apology from the US administration with some more assurances
from the Obama administration that action would be taken against those officials involved in Salala attacks,
Pakistan Today learnt on Tuesday.

The DCC, which met with Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani in the chair and attended by leading ministers and
services chiefs, took a detailed overview of the recommendations made by the Parliamentary Committee on
National Security (PCNS) and the outcome of formal and informal interactions between the civil and military
bureaucracy with the US administration. It was another DCC meeting held in November last which had decided
to block NATO supply routes soon after US forces attacked two Pakistani checkposts in Mohmand Agency
killing 24 troops. A source told Pakistan Today that Pakistan had been informally conveyed that though the US
administration would offer a formal apology on the Salala attack, no action would be taken against the
responsible army officials'of US/NATO as the incident was a result of "miscommunication" and
"misunderstanding" on both sides.

"The DCC also discussed the outcome of the US visit by Finance Minister Hafeez Shaikh and it was decided that
any decision of NATO supplies would be taken keeping in view the outcome of talks of Hafeez Shaikh, who is in
Washington for talks with US officials," the source added. The DCC decided that a work plan would be
developed for effective implementation of parliamentary guidelines based on Pakistan's national interests and
this work plan would be meant for reopening of the NATO supply routes after some more understanding and
assurances from the US sides with more communication between both the sides. Addressing the participants
of the meeting, the prime minister said a roadmap for reengagement with the US, negotiation of new terms
and conditions for resumption of the Ground Lines of Communication (GLOCs), joint counterterrorism
cooperation, greater inter-agency coordination, transparency in US diplomatic and intelligence footprint in
Pakistan, strengthening of border sec urity and non-use of Pakistan's territory for attacks on other countries
and expulsion of at foreign fighters from Pakistan's territory, are our fundamental policy parameters.

The DCC also offered prayers for the brave officers and soldiers of the Pakistan Army who remain trapped in
an avalanche in Siachen and decided to declare Friday, April 20 as Youm-e-Dua. The meeting also decided to
appeal to the nation to observe the coming Friday as Youm-e-Dua for the safety and wellbeing of Pakistan
Army soldiers and civilians. The DCC discussed the guidelines approved by parliament on April 12 with regard
to the foreign and security policies.

The DCC reaffirmed that there would be no compromise on Pakistan's nuclear programme and agreed that the
government might pursue the aim of international civilian nuclear cooperation. It was agreed that
parliamentary review and oversight would not only give public ownership to the country's foreign and security
policies but also help strengthen the hands of the government in dealing with the international community of
great national importance. The DCC strongly condemned the recent terrorist attacks in Kabul and other
Afghan cities and reaffirmed Pakistan's support for an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned inclusive peace and
reconciliation process.

In the opening statement, the prime minister said the DCC's meeting was convened to consider the
recommendations of parliament that were finalised on April 12. The parliamentary review process was an
unprecedented development and marks a new milestone in the progress along the path of democracy, the
prime minister said.

He stated relations with the US/NATO/ISAF were put on hold until parliament took a clear position on how to
proceed forward under the new terms of engagement.

In my view, Gilani said the parliamentary review and oversight would not only give public ownership to our
foreign and security policies but also help strengthen the hands of the government in dealing with the
international community on issues of greater national importance.

Secondly, he said the exercise had given the nation a unique opportunity to set right our bilateral relationship
with the US on the basis of mutual respect and mutual interest.

"The message from parliament â€” yes to partnership but not at the cost of our sovereignty, carefully calibrates
the road map of the engagement," the prime minister said.

"We now need to move beyond review adding that during the course of the concluding debate he assured the
House that it will be his government's endeavour to implement parliament's recommendations with regard to
our foreign and security policies both in letter and spirit."
