              is coming to DC for interviews.                                               Thursday at 10:00am he has
an appointment to speak with Thomas Melia deputy assistant secretary in the bureau of democracy, human rights and
labor. Is there any chance I could show him your office and you, if you will be around? I know he has a 3:30pm meeting
with Mort Halperin at Open Society. Of course, I don't want to impose but if there is any time you'd have a minute or
three, I'd love for him to meet you.
He's wonderful.
