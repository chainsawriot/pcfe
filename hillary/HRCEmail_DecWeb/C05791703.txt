Subject: Information on the Circle of Protection and the Micah Challenge

Lois,


It was nice to see you twice last week, at Georgetown and at the meeting with Secretary Clinton. Shepherd passed
along to me your request for information on the Circle of Protection and the Micah Challenge. Here is a summary:

The Circle of Protection brings together a broad range of Christian leaders, including the heads of the National
Association of Evangelicals, US Conference of Catholic Bishops, National Council of Churches, Salvation Army, Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America, Sojourners and many others, dedicated to promoting both fiscal responsibility and care for
the poor at home or abroad. The Circle of Protection statement, and a list of the original signers, can be found at
www.circleofprotection.us. We have met with President Obama and with many congressional leaders in both
parties. Our efforts played an important role in the Budget Control Act agreement to exempt domestic poverty
programs from automatic cuts if the sequestration occurs. A current initiative is to encourage both presidential
candidates to talk more about poverty. To that end we have offered to circulate video statements of both candidates on
their vision for addressing poverty (domestic and internationall).

The Micah Challenge is an effort launched by the World Evangelical Alliance and the Micah Network (an international
network of evangelical relief and development agencies) to support the Millennium Development Goals and hold world
leaders accountable for the actions necessary for their fulfillment. The Micah Challenge International is headed by Joel
Edwards, former President of the Evangelical Alliance of the UK, and coordinates national Micah Challenge movements
in both rich and poor countries. The website is www.micahchallenge.org. The Micah Challenge US movement is housed
within the Accord network. Accord is an NAE member alliance of evangelical relief and development agencies (basically,
an evangelical Interaction). The Micah Challenge US website is www.micahchallengeusa.org.
