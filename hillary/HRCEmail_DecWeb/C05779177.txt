Subject: Quartet Call


I used the points with the Quartet envoys. Strong support from EU (Ashton en route to see Abbas, will call
other Arabs and Euro UNSC members). UN thinks it is a strong package. OQR supportive, Blair will be asked
to make calls. Russian seeking guidance from Lavrov, in London.
