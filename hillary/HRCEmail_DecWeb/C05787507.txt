Dear Colleagues,

There are no words to describe the respect, admiration and love I have for WFP, its people
and mission. It has been my honour and privilege to have learned from you, worked with you,
laughed and cried with you these past 4 X years. Serving with you is - and will always be - a
profound honour.

Today I wanted to write to each of you to tell you personally that I will be departing the
World Food Programme at the end of my term in April, to assume Vice-Chairmanship of the World
Economic Forum.

As you know, I have long believed that solving hunger and helping countries achieve food
security for their citizens is the work of our time, and it has been such a privilege to do
that work with all of you. And as I have made clear, I am committed to this work, whatever I
do and wherever I go.

Leaving something we love is always difficult. But I truly believe that WFP has never been
stronger, nor surer, in its strategic path.

We've moved with decisive unity, with the support of our Board and NGO and private sector
partners, from a 20th Century food aid agency to a 21st Century food assistance organization
that saves lives and is a vital partner for individuals, communities and nations to achieve
their own path to food security. This is your accomplishment and your achievement.

You are the future. You are the trusted partners of nations and a beacon of hope for the
hundreds of millions of the world?s hungry who look to you to help break the cycle of hunger
and malnutrition.
In particular, I wanted to thank your families and loved ones who, through triumphs and
tragedies, have supported our life-saving work and the risks we take daily on behalf of the
world's hungry people.

I am grateful to all the nations that support us, all the countries that partner with us on
hunger and malnutrition solutions and all the many stakeholders - both within and without the
UN - that work with us.

None of us can ever say that our work is done. There is always more we can do. I will keep
you in my heart; I will continue to fight for the vulnerable people throughout the world. I
will do everything in my power to bring together those leaders in government, business and
the private sector who can together ensure that every child born can achieve their greatest
potential.

It will always be my special honour to have served with you, your families and the people
that we serve worldwide.

With deepest gratitude and sincere wishes for a safe, healthy and joyous year for you and
your families,


Josette Sheeran
