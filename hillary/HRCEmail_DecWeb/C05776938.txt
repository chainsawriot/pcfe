Analysis: Obama's bid for Mideast peace is risky

By STEVEN R. HURST

Associated Press




WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trying to coax Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a peace deal always has been a political high-
wire act for U.S. presidents, but President Barack Obama is performing without a net.

Stretching back decades, all U.S. intervention has failed, but the collapse of those efforts was always blamed on one side
or the other or both, not the American leader - even when he was directly involved in negotiations.

The deal that's developing now, however, could backfire on Obama if it fails to produce a treaty.

His administration, according to reports in Israel, has offered an abundant batch of sweeteners to entice Israel to extend
for 90 days a freeze on settlements in territories the Palestinians claim for a future state.

The deal reportedly includes a U.S. assurance that it would not request a further extension of the freeze after this one
and a pledge to veto any unilateral Palestinian attempt to seek United Nations recognition for a declaration of
statehood.

According to these reports, the White House has also pledged to ask Congress for a $3 billion sale of warplanes to Israel,
with wider security guarantees if a peace treaty can be signed.

That seems a heavy price for the administration to pay for winning a renewed three-month freeze on settlements, an
Israeli activity that already carries U.N. censure.
