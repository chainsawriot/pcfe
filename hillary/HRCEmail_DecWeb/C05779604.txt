Colleagues,

At the request of Arthur Bell, Consular Chief at Embassy Lome, the Operations Center convened a conference call at
1533 regarding information on the situation in Cote d'Ivoire:

      •     Embassy Lome received word from the French DATT in Lome of at least 4 military aircraft (C-160s) departing
            from Libreville and scheduled to arrive tonight in Lome with French military personnel from Gabon. These
            would refuel in Lome around 1930 EDT, then continue to Abidjan.
      •     Embassy Abidjan confirms there is no/no evacuation operation, per the French embassy in Abidjan.
      •     Embassy Paris confirms there is no/no evacuation of French citizens from Abidjan at this time, per French MFA.
      •     French A/S for African Affairs Gompertz said the commercial airport in Abidjan is not totally secure. UNOCI or
            French forces will have to secure the airport.
      •     Embassy Abidjan notes the UN headquarters in Abidjan has been under heavy weapons fire for the last for
            several hours. Four peacekeepers have been seriously injured.
      •     All embassy personnel are safe and sheltered at the embassy.
