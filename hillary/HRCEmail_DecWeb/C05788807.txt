On way to bball.

1. Interesting take b/c cony w/ Marco Aurelia was aboutt an overture to Peter Kahn that did NOT involve Cuban 5 hence
why we wanted Brazil to validate it since my last meeting w/ FM Rodriguez was after Levin mtg at which he told me they
only would move w/ action on Cuban 5 (b/y letting the one do parole in Cuba).

2. Gave U/S Simoes in FM a 20 minute download re Haiti - we can write it up.

Subject: Two Flags from S-Patriota Call

Cheryl,


Two items to flag for you from the S-Patriota call this morning. First, on Alan Gross, Patriota raised your name and asked
if you had been speaking with Marco Aurelio Garcia about a possible deal involving the some aspect of the Cuban Five
for Alan Gross. S was clear on the distinction between Gross as a development worker and the Cuban 5 as an espionage
issue, and said there was no deal. She did describe the humanitarian ways we have worked with the Cuban 5 (e.g. visas
for family members, moving one to Florida so his mom can visit). Second, Patriota said that President Roussef is
traveling to Haiti soon, and he asked for S' thoughts. In the course of the conversation, S said she would send him a non-
paper on Haiti.


Transcript will be on your desk this afternoon.
