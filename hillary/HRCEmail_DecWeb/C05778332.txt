President Obama on the Tragic Events In Germany
Posted by Jesse Lee on March 02, 2011 at 01:49 PM EST

President Obama appears briefly during the press briefing to say his thoughts and prayers are with the victims of
the attack in Frankfurt as well as their families.

I want to take a brief moment just to say a few words about a tragic event that took place earlier today in
Frankfurt, Germany. I am saddened and I am outraged by this attack that took the lives of two Americans, and
wounded two others.

I think the American people are united in expressing our gratitude for the service of those who were lost.
Michelle and I have their family and their friends in our thoughts and prayers, and we are praying for a speedy
recovery for those who were injured.

I want everybody to understand that we will spare no effort in learning how this outrageous act took place, and
in working with German authorities to ensure that all of the perpetrators are brought to justice.
We don't have all the information yet, and you will be fully briefed as we get more information, but this is a
stark reminder of the extraordinary sacrifices that our men and women in uniform are making all around the
world to keep us safe, and the dangers that they face all around the globe.

So I think it's fair to say that on behalf of the American people we want to extend our deepest condolences to
these families and we will give you further updates as we get more information about it.
