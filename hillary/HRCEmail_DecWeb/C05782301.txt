  We are on a break now. So this is an initial report, but the key delegations have spoken. I know people want
  information, and I can't imagine the story will change. If it does, I'll send a subsequent email.

  Given positive developments on the ground, the 8/25 Libya Contact Group meeting hosted by Turkey in Istanbul was
  characterized by an upbeat spirit, with Libyans and Contact Group members exchanging congratulations and expressions
  of thanks, while underscoring the considerable work ahead.

  Several themes were stressed by the attending delegations (with DepSec Burns representing the U.S.):

                                                                                                                               1.4(B)
