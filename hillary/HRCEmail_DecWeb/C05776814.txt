Thanks and kudos to all. And, yes, we will miss Lissa in so many ways.

Attached is the final version of the Foreign Affairs article that I just sent in to Jim Hoge. I really think it looks very strong,
all the more so when I compare it to Secretary Gates' article at the beginning of this year. And the reaction from Mike
and Gayle at the WH was overall very positive â€” they said it made a strong and clear case for what we are doing and
want to do. I just wanted to take a minute to say how glad I am that Lissa was able to make the time to work on this as
intensively as she has. We could not have done it without her, and it gave her a final chance (for now) to articulate and
integrate your views and your work as clearly and compellingly as only she can. It is a fitting farewell; I just don't know
what we are going to do without her.
