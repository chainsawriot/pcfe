We are working with AID on three things:


-- Their response to the OIG findings


-- engaging with the press -- so far they think there is a wapo story in the works (which they heard from Deloitte).




AID has the facts, and I will loop all of you in on their products. We will review and edit

           We will try to keep AID ahead of the wave and have the info we need and a clear plan with Raj. Tom,
appreciate your efforts to engage with Raj -- the Japan situation pulled all his attention yesterday.


Thanks,

+ Frank, since he's en route to Kabul now, with Alex Thier, and they'll likely be seeing Karzai as this breaks.

Vikram

Thank you for this - I read the report and largely agree w/ your analysis.

However, usaid=dos=S and we need to undertake a team approach for strategy and reinforcement.

The OIG report is a little sensational, but overall accurate. Technical advisers had indications of serious problems, and
did not take adequate steps. Blame will accrue first to bearing point / deloitte, then to USAID mgmt in the field. The OIG
recommendations are fairly reasonable, but it would be a stretch to say that these advisers could have somehow
stopped the KB fraud (the report does not say this, but the press likely will). Bottom line, this mainly hits AID.




Does this sound right to you? We'll try to make sure AID's points account for all of this. But this will not look good.

Frank/Vikram,

Raj Shah is sending an info memo to the Secretary on the impending Kabul Bank article referencing the USAID OIG
report. USAID needs SRAP clearance tonight in order to send it to S. Not sure if you are on a plane, so I've copied the
language below. They are anticipating a Washington Post story sometime this weekend — cannot say for certain the
day.


INFORMATION MEMO FOR THE SECRETARY

FROM:           Dr. Rajiv Shah, Administrator, US Agency for International Development (USAID)

SUBJECT: Impending Washington Post Article on the USAID/OIG Review of
USAID/Afghanistan's Bank Supervision (Kabul Bank)

      I wanted to share with you a situation that recently has arisen in the event that it comes up
during the FY 2012 Budget Hearings.

      The USAID Office of the Inspector General (OIG) recently has completed a review of
our Afghanistan Bank Supervision assistance activities. The OIG is set to release its report
soon, probably next week.

       However, I have been informed that the. Washington Post plans to publish an article on
the OIG review of the USAID contractor advising the Afghan Central Bank on bank
supervision - Deloitte Touche LLP. The article may appear in the March 13th Sunday
edition. Deloitte trains Afghan bank examiners as part of its larger contract implementing our
Economic Growth and Governance Initiative, which provides broad policy advice to the Afghan
government.

       I support the independence of our OIG and the audit community. They represent a vital
check on all USG activities both home and abroad. As Administrator, I have made it a central
goal to improve oversight of all USAID activities world-wide. I have directed the
implementation of the Accountable Assistance for Afghanistan Initiative in order to ensure
more stringent control and oversight of USG funds.

       I am gravely concerned about the findings of the USAID/OIG and have directed our
General Counsel to work closely with the USAID Mission to determine the appropriate course
of action. I will keep you updated on this and as we move our assistance program in
Afghanistan toward transition goals.
