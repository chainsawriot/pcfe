Subject: New START intel out of TN:



- Corker is still being savaged by Heritage activated county commissioner level START opponents -weird, not exactly
grass roots - and there's not nearly enough pushback (need national security message.)

- Kyl has a an op-ed tomorrow and doing news shows Sunday. They expect McCain, Durban to join him - The opponents
are still pushing modernization and now this new thing alleging the admin cutting "secret deals" with Russia on
defenses

- they really need help with pushback - including the kinds of points Gen Adams was highlighting about the
breakthroughs with allied/Russia agreement on missile defense in Lisbon - and some urgent help in Tennessee - can we
get Castellaw, others?
