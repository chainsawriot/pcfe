I didn't know about it either. Because I host Jim's party, I couldn't leave for awhile so either I go late or ask Nides to go.

We didn't even know there was a dinner planned! Do you want to go. Or should we send bill?

For those of you who were traveling, welcome back. I hope you all had a great trip to Africa.

know how you would like me to proceed and I will contact Michele at the Pentagon with our proposed course of action. I
am sorry to bother you with another schedule issues with the demands of other events.

With all best wishes, Kurt
