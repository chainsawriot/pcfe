Our old friend Ed Klein is back with another book. I assume that Matt and I can call bullshit on him?

      Phillippe:
      Hey there. Carl Campanile of the NY Post here.
      Just a heads up.
      I got excerpts on Edward Klein's new book on President Obama entitled "Amateur."
     The book claims that in August of 2011, Bill Clinton urged Hillary, in front of longtime friends visiting them in
Chappaqua, to quit her job as secretary of state and challenge Obama in the 2012 primary.
      Does Secretary of State Clinton have any comment?
     Thanks. Carl.
