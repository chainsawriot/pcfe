Yousef called early this evening from Abu Dhabi, where he had watched President's press conference with MBZ. He said
MBZ was still very concerned about previous WH statements, and image of "pushing Mubarak out the door before you
know what will come next", but according to Yousef, MBZ thought the President's comments today were "more
balanced and a step in the right direction."                                                                         1.4(B)
                                                                                           I emphasized our basic    1.4(D)
concerns, need for speed in getting dialogue started, no recurrence of violence, and importance of Mubarak receding  B1
quickly from center of political system.
