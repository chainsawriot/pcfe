Dear Madam Secretary,

I am so totally thrilled and ready to work for you. Thank you so much for the opportunity. Everyone at State worked to
make it happen and many of your former colleagues including and most especially Senator Kerry, Senator Lugar, Senator
Mikulski, Senator Isakson and Senator Cardin were extraordinary. As you may already know, Senator Isakson, as a
                                          worked unceasingly and even got Senator Inhofe to issue a statement of support.   B6
Happy to join all three rings of the circus!

Thank you,
Wendy
