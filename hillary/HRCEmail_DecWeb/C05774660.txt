Wanted to remind you about calls I mentioned friday night. Ellen/NSC have asked you to call kerry, lugar, and 5 foreign
ministers
      are making similar calls. You will get call sheets tonite.
The calls are to Kerry, Lugar, Australian FM Smith, Japanese FM Okada, FM Lavrov,        South Korean FM Yu, FM Yang.
Plan would be to call Kerry and Lugar in the morning and then foreign calls in afternoon.
You ok with all this? You will have all paper you need before u make calls.
