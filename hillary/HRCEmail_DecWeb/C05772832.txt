Dear Hillary,

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to serve the development community as Chair of the OECD Development
Committee (the DAC). I write to inform you that I will complete my second term as Chair at the end of this
calendar year and that I have decided not to seek re-election for a third term. I will return to the University of
Minnesota Humphrey School where I have a tenured professorship.

With your support, we have managed to bring the DAC into a new era of development cooperation. The agreement
we reached in Busan, Korea represented a major breakthrough. We have now established the Global Partnership for
Effective Development Cooperation, a global structure that will oversee a new system of country ownership, better
coordination between providers of assistance from the North and the South, a more rational and effective
international architecture for assistance and a new whole-of-government approach to development. Your
participation in this effort and your support for the follow-on work was crucial as it enabled us to engage many
more actors including other government departments, civil society and the private sector.

The DAC itself is today a stronger institution. When I came here the changing global environment raised serious
questions about the relevance of the "donors club." However, we immediately reached out to the emerging
economies, endorsed a new "Global Relations" strategy of engagement and made commitments at Busan that will
enable donors to lower transaction costs and achieve results with our newly empowered partners. We have
restructured the committee and re-energized subsidiary bodies that are contributing to better policies in conflict and
fragility; sustainable development, democratic governance and statistical measurement and transparency. We have
made a major contribution to the OECD's .Strategy on Development, an initiative that you announced during the
2011 OECD ministerial. This will encourage more cross-committee work of the type that created the Tax and
Development Initiative which you and the USG so effectively promoted.

I have been in this position at an exciting time and I feel that I was able to use my experience as a former
Administrator of USAID to promote real change. The next period will be a time of consolidation, equally
important, but of less interest to me. I will do all in my power to assure that my successor has the experience and
capacity to carry on. On the top of my agenda is a book on the institutions that effect American foreign policyâ€”
congress, the media, the foundations, think tanks, universities and the people of the State Department and USAID.
At some point I may ask for an interview with you on this subject, but that is for later.




Ms. Hilary Rodham Clinton
Secretary of State
United States of America

Again, I thank you for giving me another opportunity to serve. It is time for me to reflect, to teach young public
policy students and to give my fifteen year old daughter a chance to go to one of the better universities (she has
your note on her bureau!). I gather that after four highly successful years in a grueling job, something like that may
sound attractive to you as well. Thank you for your outstanding service to our country. I hope after a few years of
reflection that you will be back in some capacity. You will always have my support!


                                                Best personal regards,




                                                  J. Brian Atwood
