Dear Cheryl,

Good Saturday morning.

Our distinguished Secretary has returned from yet another long and important trip and the DNC convention has
concluded. Both were important in their own ways. The convention was a successful one in my view and I think there's
almost universal consensus the highlight was President Clinton's speech. It was a masterful and powerful one, building
on the First Lady's Tuesday night performance. President Obama did what he needed to do in his speech, but the
continuing fragile US economy is a concern moving toward November.




Respectfully,

 Mack
