It's from a Finnish Magazine. Dan & I working on a few jokes for meet & greet.

Reading his bio, he's an athlete, outdoor enthusiast, into camping. Was also "a boatman rowing wooden dories
down the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon for nearly ten years.". Won body building championships
in Colorado several years in a row.
