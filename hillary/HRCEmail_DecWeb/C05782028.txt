Subject: New EJ Settlement Approvals

Hello All,

Today, the Minister of Interior, Eli Yishai, announced that he had extended final approval to three large
settlement plans in East Jerusalem. According to his spokesperson, 3 plans were approved:

Plan 11085 Ramat Shlomo : 1600 Units
Plan 11647 Pisgat Zev - 625 Units
Plan 5834 B 2337 Units - Givat Ha-Matos

While largely correct, this press release is incorrect in one key aspect, and misleading in another. The Ramat
Shlomo scheme CANNOT have possibly received final approval since it was never actually published for
public review after the Biden visit (although during the visit it was decided to do so). The Givat Hamatos
scheme has indeed received final approval, but addtional planning (reparcellaton) will be needed before tenders
are issued and permits granted. The reparcellation schemes are already before the Municipal Planning
Committee, and their approval may be only months away. When the press pointed out these inaccuracies to
Yishai's spokesperson, he remained adamant, asserting that the tenders on all of these plans would be
forthcoming shortly.

The decision that apparently was taken regarding Ramat Shlomo (contrary to the approval reported) was to
actually publish the plan for objections in anticipation of hearings and formal approval.

These approvals come on the heels of the approval of Har Homa C No. 10310 for 983 units and Har Homa B
for public buildings and 50 units, both of which have received final approval (meaning tenders are now
possible).

Some context:

The numbers: this means that in less than one week, Israeli has significantly expedited the contraction of 5595
residential units in East Jerusalem, which signifies an 11% increase in the number of units built in EJ since
1967, 930% larger than all the government supported Palestinian homes built in East Jerusalem since 67 - and
all in one week. We can anticipate in a matter of a few short weeks tenders for the construction of 1658 new
units a 3.3% increase in the number of EJ settlement units, 276% more than those built for Palestinian with GOI
support since 1967.

The substance: two of these schemes (Har Homa C and Givat Hamatos) significantly alter the potential border
between Israel and Palestine, and construction of Givat Hamatos would to all intents and purposes preclude
including Palestinian Beit Zafafa in Palestine (making the implementation of the Clinton parameters or the
Geneva initiative virtually impossible. The Pisgat Zev plan welds the settlement to Beit Hanina, making the
creation of a reasonable border regime in the area more difficult.

Asked to comment this past Sunday on the approval of Har Homa C, we noted:


"Commentary?
Well, since these approvals are not generally announced in a press release, someone wanted this noticed, and to
send a message:

What's the message?
To the bureaucracy: all brakes are off, expedite EJ construction schemes.
To the Palestinians, for whom Har Homa is the most sensitive of settlements: don't expect help from us on
restarting talks.
To the Israeli public and international community: GOI is buying into the settler spin that the housing shortage
can be solved by settlement expansion.
To the US. EU etc.: a shot across the bow. The Palestinians are going unilateral with UNGA, we are going
unilateral on the settlements.

This means there is more to come..."

After today's announcements, we stand behind every word of our previous analysis.

Attached is a map to cheer you all up.


Best,
