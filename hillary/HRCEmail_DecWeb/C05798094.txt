Subject: THANK YOU and response to your question

Dear Hillary,




Regarding the Clinton Foundation leadership: I feel -- as do MANY -- passionate and impatient to see
leadership that could unite CGI and the Foundation in more strategic, thoughtful engagement of both
philanthropic contribution and investment resources.

So, who?

I could suggest other names, but that's not actually helpful absent a process framework for vetting candidates
and moving the search through to conclusion. I'd be glad to help, but efforts will only get us to the goal if
coordinated and contributed as a team effort.

Let me know what I can do.

With great appreciation and love,

Jan
