Pat Lang on the Syrian scuds below...

If Lang's skepticism is in any way credible then... Making public statements by acknowledging unsubstantiated intel is
not exactly solid; if disproved or never proved, one is revealed to be hollow. How about analysis first, and citing
authority of CIA, putting it on the spot, before very possibly lending credence to a disinformation operation? Does Israel
need reassurance on its own claims here? Unless this is part of a larger diplomatic movement that involves serious
pressure to come soon on Israel. Otherwise, back to square one, making statements without evidence and disclosing
that the Obama administration is spooked by the Israeli inspired propaganda campaign against it involving everything
from ads signed by Eli Weisel to statements signed by Harry Reid, et al, encouraging more of same. Unless of course you
actually have the intel nailed down. Cheers, Sid

 ""If these reports turn out to be true, we are going to have to review the full range of tools that are available to us in
order to make Syria reverse what would be an incendiary, provocative action," Assistant Secretary of State Jeffrey
Feltman told the House Foreign Affairs Committee last week, moments after making a strong pitch for the first U.S.
ambassador in Damascus since 2005. Administration officials have suggested that the Scuds may not have reached
Hezbollah in Lebanon; in that case the strong statements may be preventative. What is known for sure is that Syria has
facilitated the transfer of thousands of rockets and missiles to Hezbollah since 2006 in blatant violation of the U.N.
resolution that ended that summer's war in Lebanon. So why persist with the "engagement" policy? "President Assad is .
.. making decisions that could send the region into war," was Mr. Feltman's answer. "He's listening to Ahmadinejad.
He's listening to Hassan Nasrallah. He needs to listen to us, too."

"If these reports turn out to be true..."

Well, are they or aren't they? Israel asserts that Syria has transferred some of these old, liquid fueled ballistic missiles to
Hizbullah to drag around in the hills, fiddling with the dangerous fuel and oxidizers. What would be the point? Hizbullah
is already in possession of a large and effective collection of short and long range rocketry.
Israel is an interested party in this matter. Are we to take their word for it? What does US intelligence say of this?
This Hiatt editorial quoted Jeffrey Feltman a lot. Feltman's bias is clear. Why is he still at the State Department as
Assistant Secretary for the Near East? Don't we need a new ambassador in Iceland? pl
