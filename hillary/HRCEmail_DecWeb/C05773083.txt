      From: Sig Hecker
      Subject: Quick-look heads up about DPRK visit
      Date: Saturday, November 13, 2010

      Report of visit to a 2,000-centrifuge uranium enrichment plant and construction of a
      small Light-Water Reactor at the Yongbyon Nuclear Complex, Nov. 12, 2010.
      Visit by Siegfried Hecker, John Lewis and Robert Carlin, Stanford University

      1) A 25 to 30 MW-electric (100 MW-thermal) experimental LWR is being constructed
      close to the 5 MWe gas-graphite reactor location at Yongbyon (Jack Pritchard was shown
      this site one week ago). We were told that since this is their first LWR design, they
      decided to build a small proto-type reactor to gain design, construction and operational
      experience before they build larger LWRs. The target date for operation of the proto-type
      LWR is 2012 (which appears much too optimistic). We were told that they will be able to
      produce all components indigenously and enrich and make their own fuel.
      Current status: Excavation of the site to 7.1 meters deep was begun July 31, 2010, a
      concrete pad was poured and the containment shell of reinforced concrete is now taking
      shape. The containment structure is 22 m diameter, 0.9 m thick and will be 40 m high. It
      will contain 4 tonnes of uranium oxide fuel, enriched to 3.5 % U-235. It will generate
      electricity for the surrounding communities and be tied to the national grid.

      2) At the fuel fabrication facility site, we were shown an industrial-scale uranium
      centrifuge enrichment facility across the street from the six-story uranium processing
      building. It was housed in a building with a cascade hall 100 m long, containing 2,000
      centrifuges (we were told that number and it appears reasonable on the basis of our
      observations). It was a remarkable and unexpected sight from the observation windows of
      the second-floor control room. The centrifuges are all connected in cascades (we were
      told six cascades). The dimensions of the exterior casings appeared to be approximately 8
      in. diameter by 6 ft tall. We were told that the rotor materials were alloys containing iron
      (their words) — which, mostly likely makes them P-2-like models with maraging steel
      rotors. We were also told that although they were patterned after URENCO and Japanese
      models, they were produced indigenously. The control room was ultra-modern with
      digital electronics, computers and flat-panel displays showing the cascade flow diagrams
      and process parameters. We were told that the facility was operating and was producing
      low-enriched uranium.
      They started construction in April 2009. The capacity of the facility was claimed to be
      8,000 kg-SWU. A preliminary calculation shows that this capacity is sufficient to
       produce 2 tonnes of uranium per year (ample for the small reactor). However, if it were
      reconfigured to make HEU, it could produce — 40 kg of 90% U-235 per year.

      Additional detail will be provided later, along with a report of discussions with Ministry
      of Foreign Affairs officials about the motivation and policy implications. When
      questioned by news media at the Beijing airport upon our arrival this morning, we made a
      brief statement about the LWR construction. We do not plan to make the uranium
      enrichment information public until we brief you and other administration officials.
