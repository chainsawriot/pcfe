Subject: Ban and High Level name and DRC

Here in Tokyo, Ban sought me out (again) to plead for our name because he has to announce asap. Again I told him I'd
do so by tomorrow.



Also, he wants to work w us on response to events in DRC because of death of UN peacekeeper. Can you follow up w AF,
WH, etc?
