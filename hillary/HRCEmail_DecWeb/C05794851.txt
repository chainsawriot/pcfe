  SUBJECT: Introduction to USAID Frontiers in Development Publication


        USAID asked you to write an introduction for their upcoming publication
  Frontiers in Development. We've attached a draft for your review and approval.

         This book will be a compilation of essays on new approaches in
  development, which USAID is preparing in advance of their Frontiers in
  Development conference this June. USAID describes the publication as similar to
  an issue of Foreign Affairs, but focused exclusively on development.

        It will consist of long essays from several eading thinkers in development,
  as well as 19 shorter essays written by working-level staff at USAID and outside
  development practitioners. These shorter contributions were chosen through an
  essay contest. The prominent contributors include:

     •   Admiral James Stavridis, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe
     •   Bill Gates, Co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
     ®   Indra Nooyi, CEO of PepsiCo
     o   Emilia Pires, Finance Minister of Timor-Leste
     •   Paul Collier, Author and Professor of Economics at Oxford University
     •   John DeGioia, President of Georgetown University
     •   Judith Rodin, President of the Rockefeller Foundation •
     •   Eleni Gabre-Madhin, Founder and CEO of Ethiopia Commodity Exchange
     •   Michael Kremer, Professor of Economics at Harvard Kennedy School

         Your contribution would both open the publication and provide an overview
  of our new approach to development work at the State Department and USAID.
  Administrator Shah will also have a contribution. We think it's a good opportunity
  to reinforce your message about doing development differently with an influential
  audience.
