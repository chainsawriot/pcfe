Just received a call from the DSCC- apparently a MSG in Athens committed suicide in the REACT room at the Embassy.
Info still being gathered as to the specifics, but he was allegedly agitated about something and ran from the group into
the REACT room where he then shot himself. DRSO Marty Rath is acting and notifications are being made.
