Subject: URGENT -- for S CALL WITH BAHRAINI FM

S is scheduled to call the Bahraini FM Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmad al-Khalifa. The BCL was prepared before the overnight
Bahraini raid on what was publicly seen as peaceful protestors sleeping in Manama's Pearl Square. The Bahraini
Government claims that the protestors were armed, and moderate Arab news channels are broadcasting pictures of
swords, pistols, knives, etc. that were supposedly discovered in the protest encampment. Reports are that five
protestors were killed and many injured (but these numbers aren't verified and could go in either direction); the
Bahraini government claims that scores of police were injured in what was by all accounts a very ugly clash. Our chargé
in Manama, Stephanie Williams, believes that, from the GOB perspective, the protestors crossed a red line in criticizing
the Royal Family and calling for the fall of the regime.

The BCL we prepared is no longer relevant. I suggest the following:

Subject: Manama Update, 1345 Local/0545 EST

    Jeff — Per your request, here is comprehensive update on where we are in terms of the developing
    situation in Bahrain. In addition to the timeline below, we've heard that a GCC extraordinary Foreign
    Ministerial is being held this afternoon/evening after which the Foreign Minister will hold a press
    conference. I heard from the Minister's office that the call with S is confirmed for 1530 our time and we
    understand that SECDEF will be speaking with the Crown Prince an hour later.

    In our view, the next 24 hours will be critical given that the funerals of those who died today will most
    likely be held tomorrow and there were already plans underway for a mass rally after Friday prayers.

    In terms of points for calls, I would recommend that




    A timeline of events so far:

    •    0315: MOI dispersed demonstrators at Pearl round-about using tear gas and batons. Heavy police
         presence remains at this location. Many vehicles in the area damaged.
