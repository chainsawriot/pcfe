A few quick updates during what has been a thankfully pretty quiet week in the world.




                           I'm giving it to you in this shape because I would very much like your steer on whether it is
headed in the right or wrong direction, and your guidance on changes/additions/subtractions. Happy to discuss at your
convenience. I'm sharing a copy of Bill, Jim, Derek, and CDM.

4.   I am sending for your review a draft memo prepared by SRAP on the various political/diplomatic processes
underway in AfPak.




6.    Finally, I am sending readouts of Jeff's conversations with Adel and Saad Hariri on Lebanon that are worth your
read.
