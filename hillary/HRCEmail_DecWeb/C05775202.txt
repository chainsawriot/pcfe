Subject: Tonight's ABC World News Request for Comment

    Would appreciate your comment or guidance on the following:


ABC News has learned that European and US officials are on high alert for a possible series of coordinated terror attacks
in the US, UK, France and Germany.


We understand there is a "credible but not specific threat" of possible commando style raids on economic or soft
targets, perhaps similar to the Mumbai attack. We're told the threat information is based on the interrogation of a
    suspected German terrorist who was captured on his way to Europe in late summer and is now being held at Bagram
    airbase in Afghanistan


Can you please give me a call at 212-456-6450? (also left message on your cell and office phone)

Thanks,
    Rhonda Schwartz
