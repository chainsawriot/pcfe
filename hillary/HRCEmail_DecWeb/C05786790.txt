Subject: US-Israeli spy suspect set to return home to NYC (AP)

NEW YORK (AP) - A U.S.-Israeli citizen imprisoned in Egypt for four months on allegations he spied for
Israel is expected to return home to New York City after gaining his freedom in a prisoner swap between the
two countries.
   Ilan Grapel is scheduled to arrive at John F. Kennedy International Airport at 10 a.m. EDT Saturday, escorted
by his mother and U.S. Rep. Gary Ackerman.
   Twenty-seven-year-old Grapel is from Oakland Gardens, Queens, and once worked for Ackerman's office.
   He was released Thursday in a deal that helped ease tensions between Egypt and Israel.
   Egypt traded Grapel for 25 Egyptians held in Israeli jails.
   Israel has denied that Grapel spied for the country, as did his family and friends.
   Grapel was volunteering at a legal aid group in Cairo when he was arrested.
