Thanks for sticking with the Pakistan "apology" issue. We're in a much better place today, and it wouldn't have
happened if you hadn't persisted.

Jake will update you on a few other issues, including John Kerry's latest from his Gulf friends.
                                          which sets the stage for a solid announcement when you're in Cambodia next



Have a great Fourth.

Bill
