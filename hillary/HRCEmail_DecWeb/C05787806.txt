Wonderful hearing from you and, I too, kept expecting to run into you at the White House. Let's try to arrange either

Hi there!

I just thought you'd like to know that our dear
                                                             Seems like a long time ago.

I keep thinking I'll run into you over here at the White House since I see your name on the schedule so frequently. I've
got another few months here before my detail expires and I head back to HHS, so maybe I'll see you yet.

Hope you are well.
Andrea
