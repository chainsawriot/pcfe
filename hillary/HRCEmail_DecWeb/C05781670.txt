Thanks. I'll see what I can do, although at moment I'm scheduled to return from Cairo Thurs am. Tantawi, PM and other
senior players only avail Tues-Wed. Will do my best. Hope you have a good weekend.

                                                  to see what we can do to accelerate hikers issue. Jake will be on too.   B5

He just told me he won't be in Egypt while you are there because of the AU Summit. He leaves Monday but will return
on July I and would be pleased to see you then. How does that square w your info about schedule?
