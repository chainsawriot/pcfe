Subject:                          Update



Madam Secretary,
First plenary was 3 hours and as complex as expected. Doing NO press briefing since in process. Will reconvene in about
an hour. Will likely work for some hours in plenary, bilats or small groups. A lot of discussion but not yet where we want
to be. Good unity of our side but the tough road we expected. About all to be said on low side at this point. Will try to
call Bill secure later or write high side note when we can.
Wendy
