Per prior email, we are back to drawing board. Here is the last brainstorming list, with a few new additions. Let me
know your thoughts.

If we can't nail down a new candidate within the next couple weeks, we likely will need to only have the two delegates
PPO sent over as we won't be able to get someone through the clearance/vetting process in time.

                                             but will plan to do so later today or tomorrow unless you want me to hold f01B5
any reason.                                                                                                               B6
