Subject: Chelsea Clinton

Phil: Chelsea Clinton is in Kyiv with her husband, Marc, at the invitation of oligarch, Viktor Pinchuk. She spoke this
afternoon before 300 young university and graduate level students. Mariella and I were there along with a huge media
presence.

Chelsea was really effective with the students handling questions as varied as: how are you effective working with your
Dad on philanthropy, the greatest inspirations in life (after her parents, her recently deceased Grandma, Nelson Mandela
and researchers in Silicon Valley), growing up as the daughter of Bill and Hillary, and her favorite rock group. She is
going to speak at a Pinchuk seminar at Davos as well this week, perhaps along with Alec Ross.

If the occasion presents itself, I thought you might want to tell Chelsea's mother that she did great. A great job cultivating
a positive image of the US here. No exaggeration. The views of a hardened diplomat.

Best, jft
