MEMO FOR THE SECRETARY

FROM:          Carlyn Reichel and Josh Daniel

SUBJECT: Introduction to USAID Frontiers in Development Publication


     USAID asked you to write an introduction for their upcoming publication Frontiers in
Development. We've attached a draft for your review and approval.

      This book will be a compilation of essays on new approaches in development, which
USAID is preparing in advance of their Frontiers in Development conference this June. USAID
describes the publication as similar to an issue of Foreign Affairs, but focused exclusively on
development.

       It will consist of long essays from several leading thinkers in development, as well as 19
shorter essays written by working-level staff at USAID and outside development
practitioners. These shorter contributions were chosen through an essay contest. The
prominent contributors include:

      • Admiral James Stavridis, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe
      • Bill Gates, Co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

   •    Indra Nooyi, CEO of PepsiCo
   •    Emilia Pires, Finance Minister of Timor-Leste
   •    Paul Collier, Author and Professor of Economics at Oxford University
   •    John DeGioia, President of Georgetown University
   •    Judith Rodin, President of the Rockefeller Foundation
   •    Eleni Gabre-Madhin, Founder and CEO of Ethiopia Commodity Exchange
   •    Michael Kremer, Professor of Economics at Harvard Kennedy School

Your contribution would both open the publication and provide an overview of our new
approach to development work at the State Department and USAID. Administrator Shah will
also have a contribution. We think it's a good opportunity to reinforce your message about
doing development differently with an influential audience.
