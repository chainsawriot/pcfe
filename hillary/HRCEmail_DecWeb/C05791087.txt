Subject: UPDATE: Obama says time for killing of Syrian citizens to end (Reuters)

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The international community must band together in pressuring Syrian leader
Bashar al-Assad to step down, President Barack Obama said on Friday, as rescue workers began evacuating
wounded civilians from a besieged Syrian city.

   "All of us seeing the terrible pictures coming out of Syria and Horns recently recognize it is absolutely
imperative for the international community to rally in sending a clear message to President Assad that it is time
for a transition," Obama told reporters.

  "It is prime time to stop the killing of Syrian citizens by their own government," he said after a meeting with
Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt of Denmark.
