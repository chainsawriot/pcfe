SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED

DHS

    •      Pat Kennedy noted he will attend a DC today on screening. It's clear that DHS is still struggling to figure out a
           way to move beyond the post-Christmas screening construct.

    •      Pat also reported he has spoken to DHS about a recent trend of late-night calls to Consular Affairs and Ops
           raising questions about certain passengers on incoming flights. Often they will not request visa revocation, but
           simply want to "share" certain derogatory information without a request for any specific action.

CONGRESSIONAL ISSUES

    •      Cheryl and Rich discussed the possibility of Rich attending today's DC on Haiti to discuss the Haiti Supplemental.

    •      H is helping with Preval's schedule on the Hill next week. He wants to see Speaker Pelosi, but she generally does
           not have one-on-one meetings with foreign leaders.

    •      We are doing the last briefing on the UK and Australia Defense Trade Treaties. They won't be approved before
           the President goes to Australia, but SFRC intends to press forward and hopes to have a vote at the March 23
           business session.

      •    Rich asked if the Secretary still wants to see Senator Leahy on Kopassus. Trying to get a readout of Kopassus
           leaders' meetings with Leahy and Rieser.
