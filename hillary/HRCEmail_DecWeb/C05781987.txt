The meeting was positive. Our friends listened to our thoughts, sought clarification on a couple of points, and indicated
that they regarded the presentation as positive.

Explaining that they needed to report the message immediately, our
friends returned to the office at about the 25-minute mark. Senior
friend predicted we would have a positive response soon. He had no/no
points of his own to present.

We are ert laguardia to catch a 1400 return.
