We have a couple of options on the plane. Its a 40 minute flight.


- Baked Chicken Breast with Quinoa Pilaf (quinoa, carrots, green onion, celery, green and red pepper, garlic and
almonds)


- strawberry and banana protein shake.


- various snacks.


I left new versions of your last 2 remarks. For the World Affairs Council speech -       sent additional edits last night   B5
after you already had it. So the version that you have now reflects those edits plus the ones you gave this morning. Not
major changes, mostly in the Afghan section.
