Statement by the White House Press Secretary




The United States congratulates Dr. Mohamed Morsi on his historic victory in Egypt's Presidential election, and we
congratulate the Egyptian people for this milestone in their transition to democracy.




We look forward to working together with President-elect Morsi and the government he forms, on the basis of mutual
respect, to advance the many shared interests between Egypt and the United States. At this time, we believe that it is
important for the newly elected Egyptian government to take steps to advance national unity by reaching out to all
parties and constituencies, and by respecting the rights of all Egyptian citizens â€” including women and religious
minorities such as Coptic Christians. Millions of Egyptians voted in the election, and President-elect Morsi and the new
Egyptian government have both the legitimacy and responsibility of representing a diverse and courageous citizenry.




The United States will continue to sustain our long-standing partnership with Egypt as it consolidates its democracy. We
commend the Presidential Election Commission and the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) for their role in
supporting a free and fair election, and look forward to the SCAF fulfilling its commitment to transition to a
democratically-elected government. We believe it is essential for the Egyptian government to continue to fulfill Egypt's
role as a pillar of regional peace, security and stability. And we will stand with the Egyptian people as they pursue their
aspirations for democracy, dignity, and opportunity, and fulfill the promise of their revolution.
