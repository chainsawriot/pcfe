Miguel —

That's great news. Everyone here likes you and appreciates your earnestness.

                                          Menendez is generally frustrated with the selection of candidates for W.          B6
Hem posts and has asked me to put together pts for a call to Hilary centered on the quality and experience of candidates    B5
nominated for posts in the region.
