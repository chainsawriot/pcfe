I just spoke with Frank in Kabul,
       He'll be back on Monday, and Pat, he said he'd like to get time on your schedule if possible to discuss a way
forward.

Sorry just seeing this..

This is the first I'm hearing



I'm still waiting on Marc/Frank to send me more information                so Mike Hammer is better prepared should
we get questions on her.

Steve -- if you have not reached out already, I can follow up with Marc/Frank on both

Thx
