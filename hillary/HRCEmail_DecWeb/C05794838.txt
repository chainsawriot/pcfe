Agree broadly with Anne's paper. Just a few quick comments




-- We should focus carefully on core CT and Treaty priorities, and lay down clear private markers with MB and others on
protection of basic rights; esp women and minorities. We should prepare to engage ambitiously on economic issues as
soon as new govt is in place, ideally to come in right behind an IMF deal with debt relief, cash transfer, and maybe even
reopening door to FTA over next few years.

-- You'd be best person to represent US at Presidential inauguration in Cairo at beginning of July. That would send a
powerful signal of our interest in getting off on sound footing with new Egypt. We might consider a follow-on trip
(maybe me and McDonough, as one example) ten days or so afterward, to engage more systematically with new govt
and esp what we can do to help economically. (Ramadan starts on July 20, so would need to do follow-on visit before
then.)

All best,

Bill
