Our friend Cynthia is back for her annual Nightline special on you - this time though she'd like to do a piece about you
and SecDef Gates and come to Australia to catch you two and interview you two together. Gates is gung ho, so if you're
ok we'll set up some time for a joint interview in Australia.
