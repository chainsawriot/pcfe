                                                                I suggest that our press line be something like the
following:                                                                                                     B1
                                                                                                               1.4(B)
                                                                                                               1.4(D)
                                                                                                               B5
      We will await the conclusions of the jirga before we comment


      We have always supported Afghan sovereignty and have been
working hard to increase Afghan capacities. We share the same goals.

       This includes the capacity for Afghans to conduct their own
military operations and handle detentions




But John and I are not happy campers.


Late news- K has asked to see John and me. We are trying to work a time tomorrow. Appreciate any overnight guidance.
On top of everything else,I have some kind of bug and am going to have to call it a day. David Pearce is available for
follow up.
