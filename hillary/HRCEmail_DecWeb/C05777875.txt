Jake,

Any chance you'd have a few moments to discuss the evolution of HRC's thinking on how to address Egypt protests? She
seems to be supplying the administration's spine on these matters (Biden looked like he thought it was 1985 yesterday).

I'm writing the main U.S. react story for tomorrow, which seems likely to lead with Clinton.




Thks, Mark
