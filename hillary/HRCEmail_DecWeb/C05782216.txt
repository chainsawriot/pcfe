Cheryl,
Unless you think otherwise, please share following with Secretary. Thank you.
Wendy

Dear Madam Secretary,
I deeply regret that I am not yet on board to help carry the enormous load on you and on my future colleagues, when
confirmed. I am staying in touch with Bill and Tom Shannon, and others to try to stay current so ready to go. Hearing is
now scheduled for September 7 and we have any number of Republican friends lined up to help if needed. I expect to be
in the Department much of next week getting rebriefed and having 'murder board' and teeing up the hearing. I very
much look forward to being part of your team as soon as possible.
Best,
Wendy
