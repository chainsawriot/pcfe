FYI --

According to Danny Seidemann, Al Jazeera English is going to report within a few hours that they have received
transcripts of negotiating meetings ranging from 1999-2010, including, they claim, of a meeting between Mitchell and
Erekat on October 21 2009 in which Erekat was supposedly willing to give up on Palestinian sovereignty over the Haram.

Danny agreed to go on Al Jazeera English to discuss Jerusalem issues prior to being made aware of this by producers; he
said he didn't want us to be surprised by the reports.
