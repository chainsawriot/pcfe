David - while Cairo is preparing the authoritative transcript, Stephanie and I wanted you to have the quick gist of the
part at the end:

We will send a letter to the Israeli PM. To affirm that resumption of, negotiations requires settlement cessation, 1967
lines, and releasing pre-Oslo prisoners. The letter will include a number of points including background, references to
past agreements, current violations etc.

We will also say that we cannot accept the status quo. By the way the PA no longer exists. The Civil Administration was
reinstated... (Cites 1650 military order.) We will say that the PA is no longer in existence and we cannot stay like this.

We will send similar letters to other countries.

We will give chance to respond.

We will go to the UNSC, UNGA, and the application of the Geneva conventions. So, maybe the international
organizations can do us 'good' where the Quartet was unable to do so.
We know that we went to the UNESCO we were punished twice by US congress. We anticipated obstacles..

We will do this within days.

HBJ responded that we will support you on what you need to preserve the interest of the Palestinian people.
