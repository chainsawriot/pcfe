Subject: Update on Political Situation

PM Gillard has called a ballot for Monday morning Canberra time. Insiders agree she will win handily
but disagree over the actual margin of victory. Her supporters claim she will secure over 75 of the 103
votes. Rudd supporters claim the margin is closer (60-43). Gillard has called on the loser of the ballot
to go to the backbench and disclaim any further designs on the leadership.
