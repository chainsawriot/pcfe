Just landed Dulles. Reports of increased shelling, no access for ICRC etc are alarming. This could be Asad's reply to the
Friends' Conference. There are, I think, some things we could do to bring this to a screeching halt. They are kinetic, from
the air and would involve discreet targets. A clear warning/ultimatum should precede. Happy to deliver the ultimatum
personally. Ironically as a former military guy I am not/not predisposed to this sort of operation: not in the least. And
Iraq 2003 is out of the question. But we may be at the point where Asad has really decided to go for it, perhaps because
the entire kitchen sink - short of millitary intervention - has been thrown at him.
                                                                 I'd like to surface this for discussion unless you believe S
would oppose consideration of it. Thanks. F.
