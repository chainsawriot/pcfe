Subject: Cuba

I spoke with Marco Aurelio Garcia this morning about Alan Gross and Dilma's upcoming trip to
Cuba. Following up on a conversation I had with him several days earlier, I underscored our interest
in securing Gross' release. I walked him through our efforts up to this point, and noted that mixed
messages from the Cubans in New York, and their disastrous handling of the Richardson visit, had
raised real doubts about their willingness or ability to resolve this problem. I said we needed direct
communication with Raul Castro, and I asked for Dilma to raise this issue with the Cuban president
when they meet this coming week.

Marco Aurelio agreed to raise this request with Dilma. While he could not anticipate her response, he
said that she is aware of the Gross case, understands its importance, and would like to find a
successful resolution to it. (Earlier in the week he had told me that the GOB would remain seized with
this issue and was prepared to be helpful to both sides.)

Marco Aurelio is currently in Porto Alegre, but is returning to Brasilia later today. He is then traveling
on Sunday to Salvador da Bahia with Dilma to participate in a Holocaust Remembrance
ceremony. Both will depart for Cuba directly from Salvador. I will speak with him before he leaves for
Cuba.
