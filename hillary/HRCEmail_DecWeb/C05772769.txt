David came to see me

He shared that he :enuinely thought the meeting would be more productive w/o him and that he really has good
transparency                I pushed him and he said he honestly appreciated the support but thought this was not
necessary or prudent from negotiations standpoint - esp since            are so tightly in sync on info-sharing and
strategy.

                     I shared your desires and David's thoughts and that given David's counsel, I would connect back w/
you re not having him participate.

So for our list when we connect. On calls from 7am - 930am
