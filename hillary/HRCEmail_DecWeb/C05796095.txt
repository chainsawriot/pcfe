Not the sort of Monday I like to send you with barely any office time! Yes, the only paper you will not have tonight is the
P5+1 update since that is still being worked on and updated with classified materials.

Subject: Schedule

MS — Happy Easter! Please find below the final draft of tomorrow. One adjustment — Legal ruled that we needed
to do the signings with Brazil at State (as opposed to at the Chamber of Commerce) so we separated that out as a
15-minute event in the Treaty Room in the afternoon. Also added a meeting with Mark Grossman who would like
to give you his latest update as well as P5+1 with Wendy and team at Jake's direction. Thank you!
