Subject: RE: (SBU) Israel-Turkey Update: Lieberman Signals Moderation; Deep Concern with Erdogan's Latest Statement

While presenting my credentials at the MFA this morning, MFA Director General Rafi Barak indicated his expectation
(although not certainty) that the inner cabinet would in the near future approve the pending deal with Turkey, despite
the FM's opposition to it. Like Dermer, he thought the lawyers' and the IDF Chief of Staffs view that the soldiers would
gain greater legal protection through the deal, while not universally held, would carry the day. This outcome is
beginning to coalesce as the consensus expectation, although the political turmoil and distraction of the housing
protests remains a wild card.

Subject: (SBU) Israel-Turkey Update: Lieberman Signals Moderation; Deep Concern with Erdogan's Latest Statement

Today's developments from the Israel side:

FM Lieberman gave a press statement Sunday morning on the margins of the regular Sunday
morning full Cabinet meeting. He said he was for improving relations with Turkey, that it is
in the interests of both countries, but he was opposed to giving an apology. However, 1.4(B)
new element - carried in today's tabloid Yediot (and in English YNet) was his statementiA(D)
do not expect this to lead to a Coalition crisis even if there will be an apology."    B1




The inner cabinet did not meet today, despite Maariv and other press reports that it
would. Dermer said it had not been scheduled yet, but he expects it soon. He said the PM
and much of the government were consumed today with initiatives to respond to the growing
street protests over housing shortages and low wages.

Comment: The PM has what he needs from Lieberman to go forward. In our communications in the next few days, we
will stress that Erdogan's latest statement and the housing protests should not provide another excuse to delay. My first
opportunity will be when I present my credentials to the MFA tomorrow.
