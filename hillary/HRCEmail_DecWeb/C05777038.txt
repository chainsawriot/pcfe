In the spirit of celebrating successes I do think Earl has been very strong in Afghanistan and has a great partnership with
Amb E.

That is terrific to hear. I don't have the comparative experience, but this is definitely an energized mission. In fact, our
reps gave the two best presentations of the whole ROC drill.

Amidst all of the flurry of activity over PSCs, I don't want more time to go by before I give you my reaction to the mission
situation in Kabul. I have been going to Kabul for 4 years now, and with the staff turnover, I have worked with a number
of mission directors and their deputies.




Under Earl's leadership, the mission is operating the most effectively I have ever seen it. He has put together a
phenomenal team, they are all working together as a tightly knit team in a productive and efficient manner. Their
challenges are great, but morale is high and everyone works well together. I think Earl, Bob, Kevin, Linda and Roy are all
doing a fantastic job.
