Mike and Esther:

I wanted to share my thinking with you for going forward. I am copying Pat and Wendy for their imformation.

As you know, the Secretary created this DAS position in this Administration to facilitate a series of objectives, including
furthering the effective implementation of our human rights agenda in multilateral for a (which includes now the
HRC). And while this position did not exist in prior Administrations, we believed it was (and is) critical to playing a larger
multilateral leadership role on these issues.

In the interim, I have asked Heather to work with Esther to codify the revised position description for this 10 DAS
position so that Esther can move forward with hiring recommendations.

My goal in the end is to achieve effective process and policy implementation in this important area — and to count on
your respective openness to constructive criticism and your leadership in helping to shepherd your teams to this place.

Many thanks and I will be following up.

Best.
