Nancy —

Every once in a while you come across something that makes you realize anew what a great organization we work for.

As we speak, eight officers are combing websites all over the world to make sure we have a complete list of cables that
have been leaked. The eight officers speak the following languages, and are combing websites accordingly: Burmese,
French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Chinese, Arabic, Hebrew, Swedish, Hungarian, Swahili, and Chichewa, the latter a
tribal language from Malawi learned from Peace Corps days.

No wonder State has the most comprehensive list of leaked cables — and that colleagues from DOD, DIA, and CIA are
seeking access to it.

Cheers,

Chat
