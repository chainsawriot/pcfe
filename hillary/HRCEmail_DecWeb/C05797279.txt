Secretary Clinton was spectacular today! Cogent, clear, articulate and certainly the most well-informed person in the
room. Her intelligence, leadership and poise is what we need more of in public service. We are a stronger, smarter
more capable nation with her continued involvement
in public service. Please pass along our regards.

We are pleased that her health is greatly improved. We wish her and
the HRC team well in your respective next endeavors. If, given my background and training in government contracts, I
can assist with the best value contracting issues raised during the hearing at State or in other areas or endeavors, I hope
you all will not hesitate to let me know.

Eric
