Why don't they go w non-profit insurance companies instead of cooperatives like the Old Blues?

So after being prepared to put out very long press paper, with a fully drafted bill (though still needing work) waiting in
the wings, the strategy has utterly shifted to going back to discussing health care at 30,000 feet tomorrow evening
because Baucus is moving. He will announce tomorrow he is marking up next week. They are thinking their push has
made him move so now it's counterproductive to lay out very specific details. The speech is being totally redrafted, and
I think we may just end up putting out a one-pager.

The Baucus news is close hold; as is, of course, all of this.
