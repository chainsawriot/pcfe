Thank you for your letter of 14 February 2012, in reply to my letter of 21 October
2011
I welcome your suggestion to resume dialogue and your readiness to address the
international community's concerns about your nuclear programme. The dialogue will
have to focus on this key issue. It goes without saying that we remain ready to also
address other areas of interest to you and to look into ideas you might put forward.
However, at this stage, the main focus of our efforts will have to be on building
confidence by developing concrete and practical steps.
We remain convinced that initially we could work towards the shared objective to
engage in a constructive dialogue on the basis of reciprocity and a step-by-step
approach based on practical and specific suggestions for confidence building
measures. In this regard, we remain committed to the practical and specific
suggestions which we have put forward. We also recall our readiness to consider any
proposals you might wish to make on your side. These confidence building steps
should form first elements of a phased approach which would eventually lead to a full
settlement between us, involving the full implementation by Iran of UNSC and IAEA
Board of Governors' resolutions.
Our overall goal remains a comprehensive negotiated, long-term solution which
restores international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear
programme, while respecting Iran's right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy
consistent with the NPT.
I am also convinced that, on the basis of Iran's readiness to engage seriously and
without pre-conditions in meaningful discussions on concrete confidence building
steps concerning your nuclear programme, we will be able to open positive
perspectives for negotiations and to make progress in efforts to take fundamental
steps for sustainable co-operation which will allow us to overcome the existing deficit
of confidence in the nature of the Iranian nuclear programme, and bring benefits for
all sides.
Therefore, looking forward to a sustained process of dialogue aimed at producing
concrete results and in order not to repeat the experience of Istanbul, I would propose
that we resume our talks at a mutually convenient date and venue as soon as
possible.
In practical terms, our deputies could get together in the near future in order to
prepare for the first round of our resumed talks.
Yours sincerely,



Catherine Ashton
