There was an open-mike situation in Seoul where POTUS was caught saying to M that he was hemmed in on missile
defense in an election year.

It is not good -- at all -- but I think Mark may be pushing it a bit far.

This could be about the stupidest thing ever said by a president in foreign policy.

To explicitly say that he is laying low on nuclear defense policies because of his election right now and tell your
opponent that is to politicize all foreign policy, evidence weakness that can be exploited by others, and undermine the
administration's credibility.

This is one I'm glad I don't have to figure out how to retract but you will surely be asked if your decisions and positions
are part of the election campaign and bat that down definitively. Or even consider resigning if it's the case -- American
foreign and strategic nuclear policy can't be one way before an election and another after it -- and certainly you can't tell
your opponents that or from al qaeda on down they will figure out how to use that.

They are going to have to walk this back somehow and you need to affirm that it's only good policy that drives State.

 Maybe I'm overreacting but this turns etch a sketch into child's play.
