 •      USAID takes seriously any allegations of criminal or otherwise illegal behavior by entities that
        receive USAID funds.




 •      USAID became aware of the allegations against ISS-SafeNet in February. In response, USAID's
        newly established Vetting Support Unit (VSU) initiated a formal vetting of the private security
        subcontractor ISS-SafeNet.




 •      When we get the results of the vetting, we will take appropriate action.
