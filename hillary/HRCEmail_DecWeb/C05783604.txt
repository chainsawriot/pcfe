As I indicated in our Thursday am briefing of S, much to her skepticism I am sure, italy seems to be improving -- although
serious risks remain.
Below is Amb Thorne's latest reporting:

After Wednesday Italy moved, Berlusconi offered resignation, Napolitano accelerated approval of austerity measures
and formation of new govt. Formal resignation and appointment of Mario Monti due Sunday night. Lot of political
bickering going on but general direction fixed. Cast of new characters may change.
                         Merkle and Sarkosy have also chimed in. Spreads down off the peak but still very high. Italy
knows what it has to do.

I hope Thorne is right -- that italy knows what it has to do. We shall see if Monte can get along with the fractious
politicians and can keep the public with him. He is very smart -- but his political and motivational skills will be tested.
