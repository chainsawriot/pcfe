Dear Madam Secretary,

I hope you are well.

I contacted Cheryl Mills to schedule a brief meeting with you some time during the Chiefs of Mission
Conference. She referred my request to Lona Valmoro, but knowing what a difficult week it will be, Cheryl
also suggested I send you something in writing.

New GOS
I know you have had a couple of encounters, in person and by phone, with Spain's Foreign Minister Garcia-
Margallo. I have now met individually with each member of the new GOS, and last week I attended a working
lunch, with the Vice President and the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Defense and Interior. It was just the five of
us, and it was called to review our entire bilateral agenda.

Now that I fully understand the priorities and direction of the new government, I'd like to share my impressions
with you, and I'd like specifically to discuss the following:

USTR 301 Watch List




GOS Interest in Economic Statecraft
A good news story, the GOS wants to follow your example by elevating economic statecraft as an important
component of their foreign policy. The Mission I lead in Spain has made this a top priority, and I was very
pleased to have been invited to your Global Business Conference to share Embassy Madrid's best practices. I
think you'd be interested in some of our activities, alone and in concert with the GOS, to create jobs and
economic growth in the U.S.

Service Innovation Summit
In addition to these matters which I'd like to discuss with you, I want to bring to your attention a conference our
Embassy will host in Madrid, at the end of this month, having to do with volunteering and community
service. This Service Innovation Summit is the product of a public private partnership between Embassy
Madrid and Meridian House, and it is intended to encourage the growth of volunteering and community service
in Spain. Although the Spanish lack a strong tradition of civil society, as exists in the United States, they
understand that challenging times require the participation of every citizen in addressing the problems of their
communities and their nation. There is a growing appetite in Spain for engaging citizens in community service,
and the Embassy has undertaken a number of initiatives to support this. The Service Innovation Summit will
bring experts and service leaders from the United States to Madrid to share best practices and to learn from one
another.

We have received enormous and enthusiastic support for this Summit. His Royal Highness, the Prince of
Asturias will give the opening address. Ann Stock, Kris Balderston, and Jonathan Greenblatt, from The White
House Office of Social Innovation and Civic Participation, along with Arianna Huffington, Jose Andres, Alan
Khazei and many more American leaders have agreed to join us in Madrid. We believe the Mayor of Madrid
will announce at the Summit that her city will become the second international city to participate in the Cities of
Service Program begun by New York's Mayor Bloomberg.

In light of our shared passion for service, I thought you'd like to know what the Embassy in Madrid is doing to
promote this in Spain.


Lastly, as I noted to Cheryl, during a recent meeting with His Majesty King Juan Carlos, he asked me to convey
his warmest personal wishes to you.

I look forward to seeing you at the Chiefs of Mission Conference, and if it is possible, spending a few minutes
discussing these bilateral issues.

Many thanks,

Alan
