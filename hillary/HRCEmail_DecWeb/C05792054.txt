Caitlin:

Just got off the phone with Ambassador Crocker. We're all in agreement.



Ambassador has told the Afghan leadership how critical it is that we are in synch and we had already reached out for a
meeting with the Palace spokesman, asap. We'll let you know how that goes.

Best
Eileen

Thanks, Caitlin.




Also, I understand it will be presented to the Afghan parliament to ratify only after it is signed.

There may be pressure to sign sooner here once ready, a larger/monumental ceremony in DC before Chicago



Best,

Gavin

Kabul, I'm sorry to email you on your day off. I see you are on this email thread.

Do you have any language on this you can share w/us? We are also giving PA here a heads up on this.

Thanks,
Renee

Renee, in Laura's absence...

We just spoke to Amb Grossman. Secretary approved the SPA this morning. White House and Embassy have been
informed.

We will do official front channel pronto instructing Amb Crocker to conclude (initial?) SPA.

This story will break fast. MG wants to ensure we have our public messaging right. At minimum, we need press
guidance fast -

Having said this, let me step out of the way and let you follow up through normal comms channels.

Thank you!
