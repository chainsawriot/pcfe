Cheryl:
S will see President Aliyev in Munich. He will surely raise ambassador issue. Question is whether S can, or
should, give him a name. She will want at a minimum to say "I have heard your message/ we will nominate
someone of stature whose appointment will demonstrate our commitment to this relationship." But can she
actually tell him who is being nominated or is that premature?
Thx.
