Subject: Positive Slovenia Candidate Jankovic Leads Polls (SBU)

(SBU) Further to December 4, Afternoon Brief No. 1, Embassy Ljubljana reports that Ljubljana Mayor Zoran
Jankovic has surprisingly polled slightly ahead of long-time front-runner Slovene Democratic Party leader and
former PM Janez Jansa. With all votes counted, Jankovic leads with 29 percent of the vote compared to Jansa's
26 percent. According to precedent, Jankovic's win will give him the first chance to form a coalition
government, which may be difficult given most of the other parties that crossed the threshold are closer to
Jansa. If Jankovic proves unable to a coalition, Jansa could return to power. Voter turnout was about 64
percent, which was less than predicted.
