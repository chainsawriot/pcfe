  Nothing more than this. AP is reporting a ground assault and Syria desk says they have lost contact with Horns too, last
  reports were that they were seeing Syrian military for the first time in weeks.

  Looks like it's happening. No contact with activists inside for last 18 hours. Before that shells falling every 20 seconds or
  so. And reports of ground forces moving in. I don't think there is much to be done now apart from deploying all assets to
  expose what is to come (unless Annan can convince the Russians to secure a pause to get wounded out at least, though
  I'd be surprised if that happened.) Once they finish off Horns, they will likely move to Idlib, maybe Rastan. So this could
  repeat itself, with all the same dilemmas for us.

  You all are probably hearing the same, but please pass on if not (I'm on my mobile).

  Tom
