Subject: Very good news

Colleagues,

U/S Sherman asked that I share the good news with you: the bridging text tabled by Amb. Davies and his team has been
agreed to by the French, Russians, and others (including one minor technical edit), and is locked. Importantly all,
including French and Russians, have agreed to co-sponsor. The Chinese are not officially on board yet -- they are
checking with their minister for the formal endorsement, and are hard at work to secure that as soon as possible given
the late hour, but we believe the prospects for a unified co-sponsorship are very good.

Under Secretary Sherman is in a meeting at the moment, but asked me to send you all a note of thanks on her behalf for
the extraordinary work that has been done by this group: We have reached a positive conclusion and have a locked
text--the one discussed on this morning's conference call, including the Russian suggestion of the added September 21
date. Everyone, with the exception of our Chinese colleagues who are working hard to share their government's
position with the group soon, has agreed to this text, and has agreed to co-sponsor it.

We thank our Chinese colleagues, as noted above, for their continued efforts to reply soonest with their answer on the
text and co-sponsorship. We very much look forward to the vote at the Board of Governors later this week.

Sincerely on U/S Sherman's behalf,

Chris Grantham
