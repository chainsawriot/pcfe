Subject: Message from SFRC staff briefing on Haiti




Jack and Cheryl,

Earlier today I briefed SFRC staff about working with the UN in Haiti.




Message: Sen. Kerry's staffer on 10 issues, Stephen Feldstein, on behalf of Sens. Kerry and Lugar asked that I convey
that they would like State to leverage the outpouring of support to increase actual contributions from other countries in
the region and other donors. They were interested in how fast real money would follow the recent pledges to the UN
Flash Appeal. Also, a question was raised about how much China had given.




FYI, I was joined by DOD A/S for the Americas Paul Stockton and two JCS representatives
The session went well and demonstrated inter-agency cooperation. HFAC has asked for a similar briefing next week. H
and 10 will follow up.




Esther
