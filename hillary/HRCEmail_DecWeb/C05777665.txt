Colleagues - I wanted to share the President's statement just issued about David Kato's murder in Uganda; it touches
directly on                      Look forward to seeing you all next week. Many thanks. David

For Immediate Release                                                                                 January 27, 2011


                          Statement by the President on the Killing of David Kato

I am deeply saddened to learn of the murder of David Kato. In Uganda, David showed tremendous
courage in speaking out against hate. He was a powerful advocate for fairness and freedom. The
United States mourns his murder, and we recommit ourselves to David's work.

At home and around the world, LGBT persons continue to be subjected to unconscionable bullying,
discrimination, and hate. In the weeks preceding David Kato's murder in Uganda, five members of
the LGBT community in Honduras were also murdered. It is essential that the Governments of
Uganda and Honduras investigate these killings and hold the perpetrators accountable.

LGBT rights are not special rights; they are human rights. My Administration will continue to
strongly support human rights and assistance work on behalf of LGBT persons abroad. We do this

because we recognize the threat faced by leaders like David Kato, and we share their commitment to
advancing freedom, fairness, and equality for all.
