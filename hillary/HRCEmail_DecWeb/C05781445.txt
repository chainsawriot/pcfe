Dan and Jake,

If the Cardin call does happen today, I was just cleaning out my "Cardin" files and stumbled across a letter from
         dated June 21, 2010 asking us to look into the case of

                                                                                                     You might want to
work that in somehow. She should get credit for delivering on Cardin's concerns,

Mike
