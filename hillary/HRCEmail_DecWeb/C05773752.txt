Jake,

I just received an award recommendation from the military for a US civilian (Dale Kramer) in the field for heroic
action. The civilian was embedded with a special forces team when it came under Taliban fire (IED and machine gun) in
Paktya. At that point, Dale grabbed a machine gun and proceeded for twenty minutes to provide suppressing fire so
that the entire team could withdraw from the scene of the attack. We will look into the specific and seek a away for the
civilian to be recognized by S, but this is also an important anecdote for the public relations effort you mentioned
yesterday and that we will discuss later today.
