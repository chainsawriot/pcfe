Subject: Heads Up

I got a call a few minutes ago from Ned Martel of the Washington Post. He is doing a story on an alleged White House
contemplation with replacing Tim Geithner with Hillary Clinton. His angle was that, among other things, they decided not to
pursue it because of the prospect of moving a substantial percentage of the Clinton team to Treasury and the relentlessness
with which Cheryl Mills pursued the December 2008 agreement between the President-elect Obama and Senator Clinton
about her prerogatives in forming her own team. I told her we dealt with a steady diet of rumors about the VP swap, but I
never heard this rumor. I also suggested by the time Tim allegedly offered to leave, HRC was arguably the administration's
most effective performer (along with Gates). It was highly unlikely the President would want to break up that tandem that was
working so well. When he mentioned trouble with the White House over placements, I said there was a joke going around
Washington that Clinton campaign supporters were more successful in getting jobs in the Obama administration than Obama
campaign staffers. At the end of the process, Cheryl Mills was very effective in building a team that has worked successfully on
behalf of the President and Secretary.

Over to you guys. I'll go back to grading final semester papers.
