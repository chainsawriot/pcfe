Hillary,

I am so sorry!! I just saw this email, I haven't checked my         account because of all that is going on. Will do so more
regularly now!

So things have descended so far.down the rabbit hole, that there is terrible paranoia about everything, so all of this is
totally between you and me.

I hope it's not annoying to write this, but there isn't a day that goes by that I don't think how different things would be
on this issue if life had worked out differently. I know you have admonished me to look forward, but on this issue of all
issues, it is hard. The President's policy intincts are to do good and decent things, but the rest of the Administration is
just, well, beyond complicated. It's a bit too much for email.

So there is a totally new strategy, as you can probably read in the paper. The idea is to lay out specifics of a full plan.
There is talk of drafting a full bill; though we may never put that out. The proposal will make decisions on almost all
issues for a complete plan, and while it's a tad lower than the House bill, it still aspires to cover everyone. In fact, it will
not be so different than what has emerged on the Hill in its broad form; but it will take positions on the public plan and
exclusion-like policies (though, as of this writing as far as I know, no totally final decisions have been made on these, and
things are still getting litigated). As you can read, they are totally focused on Snowe; while many have wanted to bring
the bill price tag down, she's been pretty liberal on keeping the price tag up. All of the substance could be upended
because the political folks are in a very different place - they want a smaller bill that they think they can sell better to the
Hill - but the hour is growing late for significant changes. But I have to say, the atmosphere is pretty murky on
everything.

It is, as has been said, a high risk, high reward strategy. I'm very worried that they are trying to solve a communications
problem, when we have a policy problem.

I can't think of someone who would be more helpful than you. This entire process is being pretty much wholly run by
Rahm.

On another issue - a few weeks ago on my vacation I had some thoughts that I thought might be helpful to you. If it's
not too impertinent, I'd like to send them to you after I work on them a bit more.

Neera

Neera--Hope you've had a good, albeit, busy summer and are a little rested up in prep for the full court health care push.
What is happening on that front? Is there a new strategy? I know POTUS will speak on 9/9. Will we hear the specifics of
what the Admin wants Congress to do? Let me know if I can help? H
