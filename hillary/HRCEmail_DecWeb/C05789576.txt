Subject: Rudd's Resignation

All, I've provided on the high side my candid insights on the resignation and its implications for
leadership challenges. We are still working through the practical implications on DFAT administration,
and who might be appointed to replace him. In the meantime, Dennis Richardson will cover his
portfolio. I will be checking the high side later this evening but please feel free to email me on this
system if you would like to discuss.
