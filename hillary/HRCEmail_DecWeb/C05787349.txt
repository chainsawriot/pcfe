In the last two weeks I sent in w my work an unopened letter that a Hispanic woman TSA employee at La Guardia gave
me and asked if I could help her. I wrote on the envelope where it came from and asked for a report about what she
asked and whether she could be helped. I saw her again tonight and she asked me if I would be able to help her. I told
her she would be getting a response.

Does anyone know the status of this?
