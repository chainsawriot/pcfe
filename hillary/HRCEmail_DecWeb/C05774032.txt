Thx. There's a lot of good stuff in there but needed work. Did you get any advice from the team in Virginia?

Megan had a long, and I think productive, conversation with Judith about the speech this morning. You are absolutely
right on the tone, and Judith helped Megan work through adjustments



I just spoke with Megan, who is now taking another turn through it.

Madam Secretary, Tamara Wittes and Alex Djerassi from NEA have been working with Megan this morning on what we
in NEA, at least (and obviously we defer to you!), see as the real opportunity of the speech: to lay out a simple theme
about Cairo that has somehow gotten lost --

I will have more to say when I see you on the plane, but I wanted to share some thoughts from Judith McHale, that are
not in reaction to the speech which I doubt she's seen, but which more generally address the question of communicating
w Muslim audiences.



Judith mentions a recent piece by Joe Nye which is also worth reading that I will forward to you. Thx.

Muslim, engagement
