Subject: Mexico

Dear Madam Secretary - I wanted to let you that our Mexico diaspora project has really taken off. I also wanted to
inform you that in addition to Mexico I have made a decision to focus on education for this next phase of my life.
Accordingly, I have joined the national boards of Teach for America and the KIPP Foundation.

I'm trying to entice          to join Teach For All, the global arm of TFA as we are launching an Ensena por Mexico
program this year an opening a KIPP school in Torreon.

We have discovered that as Mexican Americans, our most valuable contribution to Mexico is serving as a conduit for US
NGO's who have an interest in working in Mexico. Eg, Henry Cisneros is on national board of Habitat for Humanity and
we facilitating their entry into Mexico.

I'd love to brief you in more detail at some point but for now, if you were to acknowledge to     hat the Teach for All
project is exciting, that would be most welcome. She has so much respect and affection for you as do O. Her connection
to you would give her an unbelievably powerful imprimatur.

She would be great and I am totally convinced that if we are to reverse Mexico's tragic trajectory we must focus on its
youth. The thing I like about both TFA and KIPP is that they not only focus on academics but on developing young people
into great citizens and leaders. That's what Mexico needs.

Warmly, jose villarreal
Jose H. Villarreal
