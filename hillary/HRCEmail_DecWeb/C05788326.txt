Subject: HbJ on Syria/UNSC

Hi from Berlin. Qatari PM Hamad bin Jassim just called. He urged that UNSC discussions on Syria be postponed until
Monday. He said that the UK is pushing for Saturday.

If the UNSC meeting is Saturday, he said, only Arab League Secretary General Nabil ElAraby will represent the Arabs. If
the meeting can wait until Monday, Hbi will go, too. It's all in the scheduling, he said, arguing that waiting from
Saturday to Monday shouldn't be a problem.

I noted that all I could do is pass on the request. I noted that I have no insights into procedures and scheduling for the
UNSC. He said, answering my prodding, that he couldn't be in NYC until Sunday night.

Comment: I don't know the UNSC schedule.                                                                                      B5
