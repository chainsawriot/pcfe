Can't for the life of me figure out what just made me think of this....

But I did NOT/NOT receive sufficient appreciation for the below. Only Jake reacted. It took HOURS to get the formatting
right. Literally hours to ensure it would work on every size font.

Without positive reinforcement I'm not sure I can continue to really invest myself in these missives/diatribes.

Monica & Shilpa -

With Jake coming and going, CPM doing the same, and Huma rejoining the roadshow after all this time of defaulting to
Jake, we know it's tough to figure out who should jump in the car with the Secretary. So I've created this flowchart to
help you make that determination:



Huma Here? YES

    I Huma in Limo

   NO SUV? YES

    I      +Jake in Limo
