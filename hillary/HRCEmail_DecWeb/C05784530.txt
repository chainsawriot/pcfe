Sorry — Original vote count was 49-37, so 14 not voting. List is below. Ben Nelson has been telling folks he mistakenly
voted no. Rubio has been telling folks in Miami, including Amb Aponte, that he asked Reid to move to reconsider so he,
Rubio, could have a few days to work on Republicans he thinks are "gettable". Extraordinary.

Not Voting

Baucus (D-MT)
Blunt (R-MO)
Burr (R-NC)
Coburn (R-OK)
Cornyn (R-TX)
Graham (R-SC)
Heller (R-NV)
Kirk (R-IL)
Lee (R-UT)
Merkley (D-OR)

I don't specifically, but he may have felt this was an easy vote to give DeMint.
