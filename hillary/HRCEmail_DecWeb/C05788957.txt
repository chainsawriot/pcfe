Many thanks. Just got a tweet that said S's speech to UNSC was being broadcast live in Syria in Arabic. I sent out a tweet
that said consistent w/ S's philosophy, she was using UNSC to talk directly to Syrian people and not just other govts -
inspired move.

You may know about this case, but I got the following message from Rebecca Hamilton, who is a real Africa expert,
particularly re Sudan. Apparently the guy described below was arrested 6 days ago; Sudan activists have heard rumors
he is in Kober Prison, but nothing has been confirmed. His parents have no chance of getting information out of the
Sudanese government, but they think an inquiry from us could help. Seems like something we would/should do,
particularly now.

Nagi Musa is the co-founder of Sudan's nascent youth movement for democracy. A 22-year old college student when
Sudan's 2010 national elections were held, he saw the need, to start educating his fellow citizens about their voting
rights. After the elections those efforts led to the birth of Girifna (for Fed Up) - a youth-driven movement pushing for
peaceful change in Sudan. They hold rallies, run educational activities, and last year organized for aid to be sent to South
Sudanese victims of the Abyei incursion. Nagi is at the movement's core. Because he can speak English he has been the
interface with most Western journalists asking questions about democracy in Sudan. And it's his tech-savvy that has
built Girifna's online and social media presence.
