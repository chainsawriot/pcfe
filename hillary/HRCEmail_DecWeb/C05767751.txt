Subject:                              Thank you!



You made legions of people happy yesterday with your speech and continuing commitment to the cause. They didn't
want to leave the State Department! It was also carried live through an arrangement with C-Span so many positive
comments are rolling in. Tim Wirth said the speech was especially well crafted in ways to help broaden the coalition for
family planning.

                                                                                                                           B6


Have a good trip.

trip should you want to discuss it.

Susie is eager to help us on the Fund. We are drafting an "investment portfolio" and she will take a look at it and also
help with potential supporters.

Safe travels.
