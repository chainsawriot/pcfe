 Dear Madeleine,

                                                  And we were so proud to see and hear you speak at the funeral.



 As we finish one tumultuous year, ending w the unacceptable raid on NG0s, including NDI, in Cairo, I am confident we
 will have much to discuss in the upcoming months!
