Subject: Lion Air Deal Update

Kurt — Wanted to get you an update - very pleased to say that we have nailed down the Lion Air deal and are ready to
sign the Agreement in Bali and eclipse the recent largest order ever for Boeing in Dubai (777s for Emirates) with
Indonesia. Indicated as much to the NSC last week and again yesterday (sent them the MOA as well as emails from
senior Execs saying it was done). I know Drew contacted the President's scheduler about the signing event yesterday
but we (and he as of this morning) have not heard back yet — hoping to before delegation leaves Honolulu.

This deal,                                                                                      It will be huge on the
economic impact and jobs front.




Many thanks,
Julie
