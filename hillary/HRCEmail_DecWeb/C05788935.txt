Jake: Would you be so kind as to pass this message on to the Secretary from Ambassador
Susman. Regards, Kelli

Dear Hillary:

The delegation for Prime Minister Cameron's official visit will include William Hague, George Osborne
and the new National Security Advisor Kim Darroch. I understand the plan on March 13 to be that
the President and First Lady will spend personal time with the Prime Minister and his wife. There are no
plans for Will, George or Kim. Would you be interested in a small dinner with the three of them and
their counterparts which I would host or do you have other ideas for an event for them? If there is not
an event planned the British Ambassador will take care of them. Let me know your thoughts.

Best wishes,
Louis
