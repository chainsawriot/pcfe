Jeff - after you dominate HACFO tomorrow, would be good to catch up on                           Also interested in Rexon's
views.




To this aim, the Security Council fully supports the initial six-point proposal submitted to the Syrian authorities, as
outlined by the Envoy to the Security Council on 16 March 2012, to:

Jake: Lynn Pascoe called me today on a different topic; you can rightly guess what that topic was, but             with it
tomorrow after the HACFO hearing.

Attached is the current draft PRST that is now under silence procedure for 0900 Wednesday. Readout of today's
discussions are below, which summarizes the adjustments made to the PRST. We believe this text                             B5


Assuming no one breaks silence, the UK has scheduled a Council meeting for 10am tomorrow to adopt the PRST.
Please advise soonest. Thanks.

READOUT

Security Council Ambassadors met March 20 to finalize a French-authored Presidential Statement (PRST) that would
express support for Joint Special Envoy Kofi Annan's efforts to resolve the Syrian crisis. Russia raised a few key
objections, but ultimately appeared to tentatively agree to the PRST as revised(attached). Russia's paramount concern
was that the enumeration of Annan's six-point plan in the French draft might not accurately reflect the written proposal
submitted to the Syrian government and therefore risked confusing the elements of the plan with the Syrians. He
proposed instead to attach the exact written proposal as an annex to the PRST. The UK PermRep said that he had just
spoken with Annan, who stated clearly that he did not want the full written proposal in the PRST, or an annex thereof,
but suggested that language could be drawn from his March 16 statement to the Council, which the UK circulated. Also
noting that he had just had spoken with Annan, the Russian PermRep suggested that Annan's statement be annexed to
the PRST. Ultimately, Council members agreed to replicate Annan's statement as closely as possible in the body of the
text. China then asked to drop a paragraph on humanitarian access it had proposed early that morning as the issue was
covered in Annan's plan.

Russia also objected to referring to Annan as the "Joint Special Envoy," noting that the General Assembly resolution on
which his mandate is based refers only to a "Special Envoy." Morocco pushed back firmly stating that the word "Joint"
was critical for the Arab League. Amb. DiCarlo and others said it would send a confusing signal to Annan and to the
Syrian government if the Council were now to appear to question the nature of his role. Russia and China persisted with
a legalistic argument, but ultimately agreed to referring to Annan as the "Joint Special Envoy" the first time he is
mentioned and thereafter simply as "the Envoy."

Russia's final objection was on the language calling for the Council to consider "further measures" if Annan's plan is not
implemented. France countered with "consider further steps as necessary," which Russia appeared to tacitly
accept. Council members agreed to add Russia's proposed language on Syria's "sovereignty, independence, and
territorial integrity."

The attached draft is now under silence until 9am tomorrow, March 21. If silence is not broken, it will likely be adopted
at 10am. At the end of today's negotiation, Russia accepted the UK's amendments to the draft press statement thus
that statement will also be read out once the PRST is agreed.
