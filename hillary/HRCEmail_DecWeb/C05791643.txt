I hope someone in the Administration can say something to make me feel better about today's outcome on the
ATT negotiations.

In 2008 I walked up and down the streets of my rural, mostly Republican community in mid-Michigan, trying to
persuade my neighbors to vote for Barack Obama. That won't be happening this year. Though I can't imagine
voting for Romney, I'm so upset over the ATT outcome that I may just sit out this election. Unlike Guantanamo
and the wars, this one was so easy. And they still managed not to get it right.

Somehow I hope the outcome looks better from where you sit.
