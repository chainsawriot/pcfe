 SPOKANE, Wash. -- Former        U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker, one of the most decorated State Department
 diplomats in the last half century, was arrested on August 14 by the Washington State Patrol for investigation
 of hit-and-run, DUI in Spokane Valley.

            The 63-year-old Spokane native was arrested at the intersection of Sprague Ave. and Pines Road at on
            August 14 by a state trooper after Crocker reportedly hit a car while driving a 2009 Ford Mustang
            convertible. The other driver was uninjured.

  The ticket from his arrest does not specify what his blood alcohol level was at the time of his arrest.

  The following day, Crocker pleaded not guilty to charges of hit-and-run and DUI. Both charges carried a
  $1,000 bail.

  Crocker is a career diplomat who has spent the last 30 years serving hot spots across the Middle East. In 1983,
  he was a diplomat serving in Lebanon when the American embassy in Beirut was hit by a truck laden with
  explosives, killing 63 people, including 17 Americans.

He served under President George W. Bush as ambassador to Iraq, having been appointed to the position
following President' Bush's 2007 State of the Union address where he announced the surge of American forces
into Iraq to quell the growing insurgency.

Crocker served as ambassador to Iraq through 2009 and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the
highest civilian honor that can be awarded, by Bush.

In April of 2011, Crocker came out of retirement after President Barack Obama nominated him to serve as
ambassador to Afghanistan. He was at the embassy last September when insurgents launched an assault on the
compound in Kabul which houses both the embassy and NATO headquarters. Seven people were killed and 19
were wounded during the attack, which lasted 19 hours.

Earlier this year, Crocker announced he was retiring due to a serious health issue that he previously had while
serving as ambassador to Iraq. His last day as ambassador was July 13.

According to Texas A & M University's website, Crocker is on leave from his position as dean, executive
professor and the Edward and Howard Kruse endowed chair at the Bush of School of Government and Public
Service.

At his initial court appearance, a judge ordered him not to consume alcohol or drugs with exception of
prescription drugs. He was told not drive while consuming drugs or alcohol, or after having done so. He must
also participate in random alcohol testing starting this Saturday, Aug. 25.

Crocker could not be reached for comment. Attorney Julie Twyford, who is representing Crocker, was in court
Thursday morning and was also unavailable for comment.

Crocker's next court appearance is scheduled for Sept. 12.
