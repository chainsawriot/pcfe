Insert "public" before diplomacy?

I'm w you and we should attach      to Public Dip since I thought the new position was about security. But maybe we
are selling    short and he should help define the new office mission. Let's also discuss.

Flagging for you an issue that my sensitivities did not pick up on to until now.




Chris Painter is coming on board to do cyber when I interviewed him it was to do cyber security but over the course of
the process apparently evolved to doing cyber issues. In that vein, it is clear he and Jim see that as meaning that all of
         ork is approved and coordinated through him consistent with the mandate of his office. In particular, one of
talking point bullets for folks after your speech is:




â€¢   As announced in the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, the Secretary is establishing the Office of the
Coordinator for Cyber [Security] Issues and has named Mr. Chris Painter as its head. [NOTE: Many submitted edits that
the office is titled Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues, as per the QDDR.]

I am confident Jim will identify the encompassing of the work and agenda           does as part of his goal; Phil Verveer also   B6
sent me a message last night indicating that he too thought it critical that Chris' role be clear that he has all cyber.




I am disinclined to mess with what    has been achieving so would seek to make that distinction clear, even if just an
exception of one. But where are you on this?
