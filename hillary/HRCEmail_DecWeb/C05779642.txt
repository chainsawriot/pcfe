Subject:                           Couple items



First, we're trying to figure out a topic for your Holbrooke speech in Berlin. What do you think about doing a reprise, in
Europe, of your Asia Society speech on AfPak? Driving the same message again to a different audience makes some
sense to me.

Second, we are still working hard on your economic statecraft speech. We can have it ready next week - the week of the
11th - if you'd like, or the following week. It's a tough nut but we're getting there.

Third, would like to discuss Iran when I'm back. We're working on a short secprez for you for this week.

As a reminder, I'm out of the office tomorrow and Tues, but dialed in and I will get you tps for the POTUS mtg.
