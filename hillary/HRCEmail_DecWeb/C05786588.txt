Subject: NY lawmaker to bring home US-Israeli (AP)

 WASHINGTON (AP) - A U.S. congressman has arrived in Israel to bring home a U.S.-Israeli citizen who was
arrested in Egypt four months ago on suspicions of espionage.
   A statement from Rep. Gary Ackerman on Wednesday said he traveled to Israel to bring home Ilan Grape!, a
Queens, N.Y., constituent. Grapel is expected to be released Thursday afternoon. The timing on his return to
New York is uncertain.
   The 27-year-old Grapel was arrested June 12 during the height of Egypt's uprising, which ousted President
Hosni Mubarak.
   Egypt accused Grapel of being a Mossad agent trying to sabotage the revolution. But it gave no evidence to
support the claims, and even in Egypt, the arrest was widely ridiculed.
   Israel on Tuesday approved a deal to swap 25 Egyptian prisoners for Grape!.
