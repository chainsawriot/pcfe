The plans are still developing and no date has been set. NIH has detailed a staff person to lead this and we will update
you in mid-August.

Has NHI set the dates for this conference yet? Are we recommending that the Secretary considers going?

This will be an important conference. NIH is also launching a set of evaluation grants early next week on women and
girls' health that the Secretary may mention in her remarks at the Mother's Day event on Tuesday. The grants support
the implementation of the Global Health Initiative by studying how best to implement programs that improve the health
of woman and girls and, in turn, whole communities. NIH is doing great work on women's health generally.

Subject: Fall Maternal Mortality conference cohosted by NHI and GHI

Dear Colleagues,

I want to highlight for you that the NIH is hosting a two-day, invitation-only Fall 2011 conference on Maternal
Mortality and the Global Health Initiative: Evidence for Action. The Global Health Initiative established a
target to reduce maternal mortality by 30 percent across GHI-assisted countries. The goals of the conference
are to articulate "what we know and what we need to know" in maternal mortality; identify critical
interventions that should be available across GHI countries and identify barriers that prevent effective
implementation of these interventions.

I am writing to flag this for you as a possible event for the Secretary. NIH is, of course, open to finding a date that would
work well for the Secretary. Please let me know if you have questions at this stage and I will keep you informed.

Yours,

Lois Quam
