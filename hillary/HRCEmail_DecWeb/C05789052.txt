DETAILS

I initiated the telephone call to hsr at 1820 this evening.

- ri yong-ho visit. I told han that the usg's decision to approve a visa for ri's visit was a concrete demonstration of
washington's intent to take steps to advance the relationship now that there was agreement on the denuclearization
pre-steps. I noted, however, that rok ambassador lim sung-nam's attendance at the track II conference and request to
meet there with ri had a natural bearing on the possibility of holding a meeting between ri and usg officials along the
lines hsr suggested during his march 2 new york channel call. Per coordination with nss/asia, I told hsr that, (1) should
vfm ri and amb lim meet in new york and (2) if the atmosphere in u.s.-dprk relations remained positive, I thought it was
likely that the usg would consider positively sending nss korea director syd seiler and me to new york for a subsequent
meeting with vfm ri. Hsr promised to convey the message to pyongyang immediately.

Ngo meeting in beijing. Separately, I informed hsr that I had received his e-mail from earlier this afternoon in which he
conveyed pyongyang's proposal that u.s. ngo's involved in providing nutritional assistance to the dprk travel to beijing
this week to conclude mou's with kapes (below). I told hsr that we were looking into the matter and that I would
respond as soon as possible. Informally, I observed that, as a practical matter, it might be difficult for u.s. ngo's to reach
beijing on such short notice.
