Tom-


 First, thank you for your very kind message. And thanks too for your personal support for me and our team during this
very difficult time.


  Secondly, thanks for your leadership at the NSC. We've got some real opportunities because you're there. I am looking
forward to the work ahead.

 And, finally, may you and your family have a very Happy New Year. I know the sacrifices that come w public service.
They are often borne most painfully not by those of us in the arena, but by those whom we love the most.

 Here's to 2011 and all we can do on behalf of our beloved country--H
