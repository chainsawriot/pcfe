I believe passionately that what we have done to strengthen public diplomacy should be an
important part of your legacy and I want to do everything we can to make sure that happens. You
have personally done an enormous amount to demonstrate that we understand that in today's
interconnected world we must proactively engage with people everywhere if we are to achieve our
foreign policy goals and objectives. We are working hard to operationalize your approach and help
realize your vision for diplomacy for the 21st century. While much remains to be done we have laid a
strong foundation upon which to build and strengthen our efforts.
