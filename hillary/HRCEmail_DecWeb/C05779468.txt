Subject: Molho and Brussels

I spoke with Molho today as he wanted to know our thinking on Brussels.
I said on balance we wanted to go ahead with it, as cancelling would appear to be an abandonment of the process, post-
veto. I said the meetings would be an opportunity to hear from the two sides, but we did not anticipate breaking new
ground or issuing a statement. They would be known to the press, but not open to the media.

Although the call was courteous, Molho is now reluctant to attend. He said 'we're not that stupid - we know what's
coming in a month and we don't want to play along'. He planned to consult the PM and get back to me. I underscored
we had no intention of an outcome from these meetings in Brussels and cancellation would reinforce the feeling of
paralysis and make it much harder to control others in the EU and Russia. I reviewed Russian positions of late as an
example and in contrast to Moiho's positive assessment of them at our last meeting. Molho admitted that Friday's vote
showed who Israel's real friends were on important matters.
