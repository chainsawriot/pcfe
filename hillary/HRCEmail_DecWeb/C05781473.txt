Subject: grapel case

I spoke to the Prime Minister about the Grapel case one on one today. He had already spoken a couple of weeks ago
with EGIS and I believe the ForMin had written to him as well. He seemed to accept that the case most probably was
not what the Egyptian press claimed—Israeli spy—although he also believed that Grapel had done illegal things in
Egypt. He did express some interest in avoiding a bilateral problem.
