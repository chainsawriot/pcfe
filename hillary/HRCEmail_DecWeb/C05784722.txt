Very cool and great timing. Now, Hillary should persuade the President to screen it for VIP guests at the White
House and leak it to the press.
You are all doing fantastic work.

 Cheryl/ Melanne,
 Has Hillary seen the terrific bio film of Aung San Suu Kyi's life starring Michelle Yeoh, directed by Luc
 Besson? If not, I highly recommend it to her and to you. I just watched an Academy screener of the film
 tonight--and I think it would be great for Hillary to host a showing at State (and for the President to show it at
 the White House screening room). Michelle Yeoh is quite wonderful, as his David Thewlis who plays her
 husband. The title of the film is The Lady, made by Europaccorp--Left Bank Pictures--France 2 Cinema--and
 might get an Academy nomination. I'm sure that Chris Dodd can arrange a screener for you, if he hasn't
 already.
 All the best for the holidays,
 Derek
