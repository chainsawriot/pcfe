Cheryl,

Hope you had a great Thanksgiving, and have a relatively quiet weekend.

I really appreciated your advice on my future (such as it is).




Please let me know if you have any other suggestions on how to navigate all this. Otherwise, I'll just sit tight, do my job,
and see what happens.

Take care,

Bill
