Subject: Update  1: Mali Transition Agreement to Install Interim President (SBU)

 (SBU) Embassy Bamako comments under the transition agreement reached between the CNRD and ECOWAS,
 President Toure would be removed, most likely by constitutional court decree, and the national assembly
 president would be installed as interim president. The pact does not define the CNRD's role in the transition.
 Post remains skeptical whether the agreement will resolve the situation, as the mutineers previously switched

positions and the agreement omits most of the relevant details on transition implementation. Post also notes if
the CNRD insists on a more active political role, it will be difficult to assert the mutiny has been reversed.

Subject: Malian Junta leader reportedly agrees to hand over power (SBU)

(SBU) The agreement was announced in a statement discussed by ECOWAS negotiator and Burkinabe Foreign
Minister Bassole, and signed by CNRD Captain Sanogo, according to press. Under the agreement, National
Assembly speaker Diouncounda Traore will head a transition government tasked with organizing elections in 40
days. Embassy Bamako comments it has not yet seen a signed agreement, and the junta has acted inconsistently
before. If an agreement has been reached, and the junta follows through, the constitutional court likely will
move quickly to institute the transition government.

(SBU) There is no change to Embassy Bamako's authorized departure status or plans.
