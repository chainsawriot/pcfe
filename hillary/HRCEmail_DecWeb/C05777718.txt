Cheryl,

I had a good conversation with Amb Jeffrey and he wants me to start immediately. I told him that I was ready to take on
this enormous challenge but first needed to talk with you on timing, the reporting chain and staff, plus transition on FtF
front (most important to me). On staffing, he wants S to persuade SecDef to appoint a 3-Star counterpoint for the
coordinator to work with on OSD side. He is looking at the model that was used to set up the first Iraq office in
Washington under Ambassador Ricciardone, Bob Godec, Jeannine Jackson etc. back in 2002/03. I was working on
Afghanistan then and had some interaction with the setup team. He could not recall if the team was part of NEA or part
of P back then.

He envisions that the "coordinator" will have three jobs related to the transition: be the communication link between
all the inter-agency players in DC and in Iraq, especially keeping the Embassy looped in; push the bureaucracy to carry
out commitments, especially the military; encourage creativity and flexibility on all fronts dealing with this
transition. There are five pieces: OSCI, police/justice training, USG presence, intel sharing/force protection and high-
end services (medical, medivac, Logcap etc.)

He mentioned that there will be a large transition conference next Friday. Amb Jeffrey, General Austin, Deputy
Secretary Nides and Pat Kennedy will all be attending. He recommended that I attend as well.

I am available to discuss this all with you in person or over the phone today, this weekend or next week. I am headed to
USAID this afternoon for Liberia's strategic review but can be reached on my blackberry

Thanks, Pat
