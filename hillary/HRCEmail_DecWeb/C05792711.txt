FROM KABUL



      currently at the hospital at Bagram Air Base; he arrived here yesterday. He was moved out of ICU this afternoon,
and will be put on a military hospital aircraft to Landstuhl, Germany, sometime between 0100-0500 local. He will
receive further treatment there.




I have been able to visit him several times; his spirits are very good and his thoughts are all for his family, his teammates
and his fallen comrades. He told me he deeply regrets being forced to leave Afghanistan this way. (He signed up for a
two-year tour, and had only begun this assignment in June.)

FYI â€” he has signed an unlimited privacy waiver.
