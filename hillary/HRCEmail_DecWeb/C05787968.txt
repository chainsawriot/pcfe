Cheryl,


Shepherd Smith, the religious leader who accompanied Kay Warren to meet the Secretary, called me. He was, of course,
appreciate of the opportunity to meet with the Secretary and you now and stands ready in the future to discuss any of
these matters.


He and Kay spent an hour on these topics
          She began the meeting by reassuring them that PEPFAR would remain in the State Department and not be
moved to USAID.


They also received assurances from Senate leaders that the report required by legislation on the cost efficiencies of
moving PEPFAR to USAID and related implications would not be used to engender further discussion on a PEPFAR.


Yours,


Lois
