Subject: Dutch to begin troop withdrawal from Afghanistan in August (SBU)




(SBU) Prime Minister Balkenende said the Netherlands will begin drawing down its 1600-member contingent - currently
stationed in Uruzgan province - in August 2010. The Netherland's coalition government collapsed February 20 when the
Labor Party and Balkenende's Christian Democratic Alliance disagreed over the country's commitment in Afghanistan.
