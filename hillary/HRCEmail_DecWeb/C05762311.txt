I will get you the language tomorrow.

Bill and I didn't get into the steps -- I'll ask him to sketch out his approach for you tomorrow.

                                              to discuss whether there were any other ways to get the result we wanted re
Georgia.                                                                                                                    B5
                                                                I tend to think Bill Burns has a good take on them;
does he have suggestions as to what steps we would take to realize his idea?
