'Hillary and I ...'
Much to the disappointment of the national political rumor mill, Hillary Clinton won't be President Obama's
running mate in 2012. But according to the transcript from tonight's Obama fundraiser with Bill Clinton, the
president trotted out this line leveraging his secretary of state's popularity in a campaign context:

Hillary and I we've spent the last three and a half years cleaning up after other folks' messes. (Applause.) And by the
way, we've got them -- we're starting to get them pretty cleaned up. (Applause.) The war in Iraq is over. (Applause.)
We're transitioning in Afghanistan. We've got the strongest allies we've ever seen. And al Qaeda is on the ropes.
(Applause.) So we've done what we said we'd do. (Applause.)

But when you've got the leading contender, the presumptive nominee, on the other side suddenly saying our
number one enemy isn't al Qaeda, it's Russia -- (laughter) -- I don't make that up. (Laughter.) I'm suddenly
thinking what -- maybe I didn't check the calendar this morning. (Laughter.) I didn't know we were back in
1975. (Laughter.)

The tricky thing for Democrats about Hillary Clinton's massive popularity is that the Hatch Act bars her from
actually hitting the trail as a surrogate, so they've got to figure out other ways -- like this one -- to make her a
campaign asset this year.
