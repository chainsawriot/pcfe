I saw President Abbas today to deliver the post-vote message. I'll report more on the other system. but aiven the lonn
weekend I wanted to pass along a few points.                                                                                 1.4(B)
                                                                                                                             1.4(D)
                                                                                                                             B1




                                                                     We agreed to meet again in the next few days to
have a more detailed discussion of the way forward.

Separately, after last night's vote, we touched base with a number of Abbas's aides to get a sense of the reaction, and
some contacts we have not seen in a while reached out to us.




The Palestinians' public messaging has been sharp. Shortly after the vote last night, Yasir Abed Rabbo told the media
that the Palestinians would "reconsider peace negotiations," claiming that the US use of the veto was "unbalanced" and
had damaged the peace process. Today, Abd Rabbo said the PLO would "go to the General Assembly of the United
Nations to adopt a resolution condemning settlements and asserting their illegality, before returning to the Security
Council."                                                                                                                         1.4(D)
                                                                         Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum called on the              B1
PLO to abandon the peace process, and described the veto as "an oppressive decision which disgraces the rights of the
Palestinian people and reveals the truth about US support for all of the crimes the Zionist enemy commits in its service."

On the ground, some local demonstrations have taken place. Shortly after the Security Council session, there were Fatah
rallies late last night (local time) in both Hebron and Ramallah. In Ramallah, a crowd estimated at around several
hundred marched to the Mugata'a, where Abbas briefly addressed them.                                                    1 4(B)
                                                                                                                        1.4(D)
                                                                                                                        B1

That said, Fatah Central Committee member Tawfiq Tirawi is calling publicly for a "day of rage" against "American
blackmail" on February 25, urging demonstrators to protest the veto after Friday prayers. The West Bank village of Beit
Ummar (Area C) has re-branded its weekly "popular resistance" protest against settlements and the separation barrier as
a protest against the US use of the veto; similar activities are planned for other villages. Clashes last night in Silwan in
East Jerusalem, and in the West Bank village of Umm al-Khair near Hebron, appear not to be related to events in New
York.

We have issued a warden notice announcing temporary travel restrictions for Routes 1 and 90 and suspending personal
travel to the West Bank through Monday; it is already being picked up in the press. I was also asked to cancel a planned
trip to Birzeit University, near Ramallah, at the request of university administration, who said they are concerned about the
potential for veto-related student demonstrations.
