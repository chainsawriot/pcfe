Madam Secretary, we are working on it. The SCAF is involved. They know who Secretary LaHood is and have had good
meetings with him, which helps. I did give Secretary LaHood a call just to say that we were doing everything we could
and I hoped we could resolve this in a couple of days. This NGO issue has been a huge drag on the relationship, just as
we face this entirely new political scene.


We very much look forward to seeing you in March.
Anne

Dear Anne,


He called me about his son and I told him you were working on it. And that we hoped to keep it quiet until you could
resolve. Ops has his number if you want to contact him directly if there is any news to share.


When I spoke w FM Amr this morning, he said he understood how important it was for our whole economic and security
agenda to resolve the NGO issue. Roiling the waters further over LaHood's son is not, however, the kind of positive step
we were hoping to see!


Thanks for all you're doing, Hillary
