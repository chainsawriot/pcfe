Wendy--

Thanks for all you're doing. I feel like you've been thrown into the very deep end of a very big pool. Lucky for us, you're a
superb swimmer! Btw your emails and my conversations w others, I feel fully informed. I look forward to talking w you
when I'm in the office Tuesday.

I hope you and your family have a happy and blessed new year and that the world does too! All best, H
