Esther:
  I'm not sure how you left it with the Secretary last evening, but I would recommend 10 send an update (Kelly Siekman
has sent them to me previously) to Huma, Phil, Jake, and the S_SpecialAssistants when the voting information is
available. You also may need to respond to this call request from Ferrero-Waldner, but Huma can advise if that is the
Secretary's view.
