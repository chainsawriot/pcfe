Hi Huma-If you are w/S would you pass her this note? Hopefully before she speaks to Senator Leahy? Thanks.

Madam Secretary-We have had a chance to review a draft of Senator Leahy's appropriations bill which is scheduled for
mark-up on Wednesday. In addition to the higher levels of funding that that I've relayed previously, the Chairman is
carrying language on a number of your priorities including:

Tunisia loan guarantee
Egypt debt relief
Enterprise fund authority for Egypt, Tunisia, Pakistan and. Jordan
Continuation of phases 1&2 of pay comparability Increase in the cap for A/S positions Broad transfer authority inside of
OCO Reauthorizing OPIC.

In short, the Chairman has been very good to us. I thought you should know that before you connect with him if you
haven't already. Sorry for the informality. Dave
