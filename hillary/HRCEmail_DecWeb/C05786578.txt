Subject:                          FW: YEMEN WOMEN BURN FACE VEILS TO PROTEST PRESIDENT SALEH



FYI




(SBU) The protesters burned veils and scarves in a televised Sana'a rally, media report. The Yemen desk
comments they were protesting the recently reported killings of women by security forces. The burning of
scarves and veils is a traditional form of tribal protest, but this is the first time the practice has been utilized for
political purposes. (Ops/Yemen desk e-mail, AP)
