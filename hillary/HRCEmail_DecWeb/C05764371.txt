Darius:

Congratulations to you.


While this is a huge loss for the MCC and us, it is a big win for Africare and for those of us continuing to invest in Africa's
future.

I am looking forward to supporting you and the work that you do and hopefully, remaining connected.

Best.

Subject: I have decided to leave MCC

Friends,

I have been offered the job of President and CEO of Africare, a US-based NGO focused on Africa's development.

I have decided to take it and will start there in January.

Accordingly, I intend to resign from
MCC at the end of December.

By then, hopefully, Daniel will have been confirmed and he'll be firmly at the helm of MCC.

In the meantime, I will continue to: lead the organization, make sure MCC continues to give him all the support he needs
for his confirmation, and ensure that he hits the ground running to lead MCC when he takes over.

Darius
