Subject:                          Chu-Clinton dialogue



Hi Cheryl- I was talking to Carlos about the Chu-Clinton dialogue and wanted to provide you with a few points from my
experience over the past few years. To be perfectly blunt, to make DOE the principal contact with energy ministries is
patently ridiculous. If that had been the case, I would have had little to do over the past three years. I would estimate
that seventy-five percent of my work has been with energy ministries, primarily energy ministers. When we deal with
other countries on energy security issues, we are often working on issues that relate to domestic issues within the
country. Those issues, which invariably have international ramifications, e.g., pipelines, are almost always handled by
the energy ministries. DOE has little or no capability to be the primary interlocutor on these issues and to make the
necessary links between energy security and political and economic security. Having said this, we should coordinate with
DOE and in certain isolated situations it may make sense for DOE to take the lead. Best, Dick
