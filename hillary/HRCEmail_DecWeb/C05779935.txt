I raised this idea over the weekend, but know how much you had going on and it obviously cannot be done overnight.
As it happened, I was meeting                   today on something else and mentioned it to him.



                                                                            I can get some S/P people to help flesh it out
if you are interested. AM

This may be a crazy idea, but as far as we can tell we need ideas. Suppose we launched a "Pledge for Palestine"
campaign that copies Warren Buffet's "The Giving Pledge" campaign, described below — he's trying to get 40 billionaires
to give away most of their money. I had asked some S/P folks to think about how we might take that campaign global to
help change the attitudes of elites in places like Pakistan and Latin America, but perhaps Warren Buffet could be
convinced to lend his name — or perhaps Michael Bloomberg or Danny Abraham (together with a very wealthy Muslim) -
to a similar Pledge for Palestine campaign. Such a campaign among billionaires/multi-millionaires around the world
would reflect a strong vote of confidence in the building of a Palestinian state and could offset the ending of the
moratorium for Palestinians (there would also be a certain shaming effect re Israelis, who would be building settlements
in the face of a pledge for peace). With even 30 calls to the right people in the Clinton fundraising network it should be
possible to generate a substantial enough amount quickly enough to capture the public imagination on the heels of the
 President's speech and, critically, to serve as an expression of global solidarity with the Palestinians and but also a
meaningful promise of material improvements for Palestinians on the West Bank. That could significantly bolster Abbas
 in a way that could help him stay in the talks. This is what diplomacy beyond the state should mean.

A brief description of the Buffett campaign is below; a longer description with the people Buffett has approached is
attached.

Warren Buffet's "The Giving Pledge"

WHAT: Launched by Warren Buffett during the Summer of 2010, the Giving Pledge is an effort to invite the wealthiest
individuals and families in America to commit to giving the majority of their wealth to the philanthropic causes and
charitable organizations of their choice either during their lifetime or after their death. Each person who chooses to
pledge will make this statement publicly, along with a letter explaining their decision to pledge. At an annual event,
those who take the pledge will come together to share ideas and learn from each other.
