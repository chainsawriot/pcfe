I spoke to PPO -- they did not have a say in these appointments.

Under the International Religious Freedom Act which governs this Commission, "three Commissioners are selected by
the President, two by the leaders of the President's party in Congress, and four by the congressional leaders of the party
not in the White House."

One of the individuals below was selected by Boehner, the other by McConnell.

WASHINGTON (ABP) â€” Two new commissioners appointed to an independent panel that advises the State Department
on international religious freedom violations are drawing criticism for holding views described as out of the mainstream.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) picked Zuhdi Jasser, president and founder of the American Islamic
Forum for Democracy, for his choice on a bipartisan panel appointed by leadership of both houses of Congress and the
White House.

Jasser fills a slot vacated by Southern Baptist Convention Religious Liberty Commission President Richard Land, who was
appointed in September 2001 by President George W. Bush and then reappointed, after rotating off briefly, by Senate
Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) in 2005, Land was ineligible for reappointment due to newly imposed term limits.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations described Jasser as a "mere sock puppet for Islam haters and an enabler of
Islamophobia."

The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom's other new member, appointed by House Speaker
John Boehner (R-Ohio), is Princeton University professor Robert George, who has faced questions about his own ties to
anti-Muslim organizations.

George, a Catholic, is also co-author, with Southern Baptists Timothy George and Chuck Colson, of the Manhattan
Declaration, a 2009 conservative document that has recently drawn attention for comparisons to a historic declaration
by church leaders opposed to Nazi Germany in the 1930s.

With Land's departure, the commission's only remaining Baptist is William Shaw, immediate past president of the
National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc., and pastor of White Rock Baptist Church in Philadelphia, appointed by President
Obama. There are three remaining vacant positions yet to be filled.
