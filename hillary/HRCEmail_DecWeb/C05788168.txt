Subject:                           new yorker piece on Obama



I have a tough quote on the Obama campaign against us in the primary in the piece. I'm sorry if this creates any
problem. But I was asked a factual question (in a public forum), and I answered with the reality that I saw. Below is a
link to the page my quote is on.

Hope you're well, and my again my apologies if this is a problem.
