Will follow up on Thaci, NSA, Alec and NY travel. I haven't heard about Lobo but will ask about his schedule.

Subject: Schedule issues

1) When Thaci comes, pls be sure MCC Pres Yohannes is in mtg

2) I'd like to arrange a visit before July to the National Security Agency. Gen Alexander heads it. I would take Jake and
maybe Cheryl FM Hague visited on his last trip and it was a little odd that I hadn't.

3) I want to see Alec Ross in next few weeks.

4) I heard Pres Lobo of Honduras is coming to DC week of 3/26. What's his schedule?

5) I have a meeting in NY at 4 on April 27th at Marcum LLP where I went two weeks ago so will need to take the 2pm
shuttle to NY on that Friday.
Also, pls tell Bill's office about it because he will go too.

6) I'd like to take the late shuttle (is it 9pm?) to NY next Wed 4/5 after Cheryl's dinner and back to DC on 4/8 on the 7pm
shuttle.

7) If I go to Durban on S Africa trip, I'd like to stay at the Oyster Box Hotel
