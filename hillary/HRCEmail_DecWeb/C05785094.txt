From my team:


Francis Collins will be meeting with Trevor Mundel (Gates' new global health lead) next TUESDAY, DECEMBER 20TH. They
will be discussing a range of issues and cooperative activities, but Dr. Collins will almost certainly bring up the issue of
cookstoves with Dr. Mundel. (We are advocating that Dr. Collins do so, following up on your conversation).


They will raise cookstoves in the context of NIH's interest in supporting clinical evaluation through randomized control
trials and other tools. They are aware that there are mixed views on investments in cookstoves at Gates, and hope to
have a conversation on why NIH believes this is an important initiative.


They believe Gates feels there is a need for more evaluation and foundational research on effects of unvented stoves to
build the case for investment. With Dr. Mundel's new role, this is a good moment for a conversation on NIH's views and
where there is room for collaboration this topic, as NIH is currently supporting a number of projects assessing the effects
of improved cookstoves in low/middle income countries where Gates already works.
