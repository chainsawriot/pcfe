Subject:                          Some updates



A few updates — hi side has been down so I haven't seen classified emails in the past few hours. I'll be in around 930 or
10 tomorrow.


      1. Waiver update




Dave Adams confirmed that the plan is for the FY 12 budget language to close on Saturday, and the "final"
language will be available on Sunday. We don't have much time to move on the edits, but H is doing all it can.




Tom wants to underscore that this is still very much NOT in the bag. It may all fall apart. But we're working it.


      2.   NDAA update


Not much beyond what I emailed you. At a minimum, your call bought us time — Levin and McCain back to negotiating
language.


      3.   Force Posture NSC readout

Bill can give you a fuller readout tomorrow.


    4. Syria oped


A new draft will be in your book tonight.




    6. IF speech


Eric Schmitt grabbed Mike Posner afterward and said he would like to help amplify the speech because he thought it
needed to be broadcast far and wide. Very positive reviews from others in the audience.
