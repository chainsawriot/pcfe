Thanks in particular to you for all your work - you are getting specific shout-outs from your partners in this effort for
your support of the ground game in Geneva for the last 5 months, on both the statement in march and the resolution
today.

Many thanks

The resolution on human rights for Igbt people-- first one in history-- just passed at Human Rights Council.

Pakistan called vote.

Vote was
Yes 23
Abstain 3
No 19

With US cosponsoring.

There were some fireworks--and the atmosphere was somewhat raucous. But all well in the end.

Team Geneva-- amb donahoe, melanie, mark, and esp sarah did great work.
Really historic stuff.

Congrats also due to wes and shane and the rest of the dc team too-- working on all the demarches and organizing last
minute phone calls etc.



A big win for human rights--expanding the circle of who counts as fully human, affirming the universality of human
rights.

Dan
