They have now accepted our bail money, thus removing the roadblock that has bedeviled us for the past two days. The
lawyers and our people are going back to the court, then to the prosecutors' office for some final paperwork.

If this goes okay, we will stage our amcits and third country personnel in about thirty minutes to depart.

We had some back and forth with the plane last night and ended up paying a $8000 fine for our allegedly improper flight
plan. (This sort of practice was common I understand during the evacuation, with "gratuities" even being paid to the air
traffic controllers.) Our crew was hassled and slept in the plane. We paid the fine, and now the plane has permission
to depart.

Two generals, one from Interior and one from Military intelligence, are at the airport, presumably to facilitate the
departure.
