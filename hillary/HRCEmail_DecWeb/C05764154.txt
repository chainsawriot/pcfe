SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSFIEID

I have been in meetings most of the day, but wanted you all to have a quick synopsis of this morning's meetings.




            Jack said that Congresswomzn Lowey .upas upset over a number of things, including no heads-up on problems
            with Armorguard, no notification on decision to attend UNDP Board meetings headed by Iran, and
            repfcgrammrig of money from education and other things to energy projects in Pakistan. There was a great
            ,;e.;                   a.;■.:1iSS;011 of the UNDP issue and we are trying to get more details on why this was not
            seised to the attention of Piincipals. in addition, Harold noted that there is a requirement that we send a report
            Lo V;'12 ficli within 30 days of a decision not to abide by the prohibition on attending meetings chaired by a state
                        of tet-roc.

                        :.'orc noted a series of calls being made to the Hill on missile defense. In the subsequent meeting, Phil

            to brie; iJA O. the Warsaw meetings did not go weli, but the Poles were restrained in public comments, while
            uie PFap,ue meetings went better, but the Czechs had immediately delivered a headline to the press -- "U.S.
            C,,it'f -Ci.e9S        snield in Central Europe, Russians happy." Phil was off to brief the Hill, but expected a fairly
            dif-fif7.ult time there.

        We are trying to get all the clearances on the strategy paper for the Secretary on the Goldstone
        Report. Meanwhile, Jack noted that the Israelis are pressing hard for a stronger U.S. public response against the
        report.

Afghanistan /Pakistan

    4, Apparently,                        Hill briefings on Afghanistan and Pakistan yesterday went very badly. Senator
        Reid said that it was the "worst briefing" he had had in 25 years. They were very upset that Petraeus,
                    z:nd Hulbi (JOKE weir not there, and that they had not received the McChrystal Report in advance.
