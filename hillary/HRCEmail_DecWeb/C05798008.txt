Subject: a letter to Princeton

Dear Hillary,

I was so glad to see the pictures of you this week back at work; you look great and the affection of the entire
Department was evident. I heard from Jake that you got sent enough flowers to open a florist's shop!                           B6




                                                                                                                               B6

                                                                                  I will seek your counsel as soon as it is
 possible, but truly, what I most want to see is you getting a real break.

 All best,
 AM
