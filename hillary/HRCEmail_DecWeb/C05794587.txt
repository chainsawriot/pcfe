Hillary,

I just want to offer my personal condolences over the loss of four fine foreign service officers. The Ambassador
was a perfect role model of the kind of person we need representing us around the world, and the others had so
much to give -- and already had given so much.

I know it has been a hard week for you, and I wanted simply to express my sympathy and tell you I was
thinking of you.

Bob Gates
