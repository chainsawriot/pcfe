Here is a read-out of the meeting with Kyl in Az. Lots of follow-up questions and take-backs, but Jim Miller sensed Kyl was
looking for a way to help us in the lame duck (though he didn't say so explicitly). The schedulers are still working on a
meeting wed between you, the vp and kyl.

Below is high level summary of meeting (thanks to Natalie)

Will provide more later today

Summary


•          BLUF: Sen. Kyl said briefing was very helpful; very much appreciated the spirit of it; looks like the
questions are being answered. He said he would like to absorb all of this; would like Administration to fill in
loose ends discussed at meeting. He is looking at VP/SecState meeting as one decision point, but unsure will
have time to talk to colleagues before Wednesday.

•          Sen Kyl noted several times the challenge is to absorb all of this in time to evaluate and educate the
Senate in order to move New START in lame duck session. This is a lot at the last minute (no fault of anyone).

•          Need to tell the appropriators about all of this and the contingencies, so they will not be surprised
later on. The more transparency, the earlier, the better.

•          Sen Kyl worries about budget hawks and doves. Although the presumed logic that it will be easier to
get funding if New START is ratified is probably right, even with New START, need to ascertain that we have
done all we can do to ensure funding for the future.

•         Need to ascertain views of Republican colleagues in House and Senate; need Administration's help
with Democrats. He noted we can take their temperatures with respect to long-term commitment (referenced
hand-written graph for CMRR/UPF).

•         Sen Kyl was to call Senators Kerry and Sessions Friday afternoon.
