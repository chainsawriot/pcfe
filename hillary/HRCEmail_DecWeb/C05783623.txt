We could certainly ask for a plane on Tuesday.
Here are my thoughts on the Tuesday schedule:
Two Open Government events -- we could ask Bill Burns to cover.
Speech at USGLC -- would need to cancel
                         It's the only day of their conference.
International Security Advisory Board -- Ellen can cover.
                                 can reschedule.
              -- can have Bill cover and report back.

Subject: HELP!

I feel an obligation to go to Betty Ford's funeral which I just learned is on Tuesday--yikes! What can be done to salvage
the Tuesday schedule? And could I get a plane to go?
