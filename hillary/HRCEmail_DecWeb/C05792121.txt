Subject:                          McCarthy era remorse



Madam Secretary,
The historian is a work of a memo for you that was formally tasked, to let you know whether the Department has ever
issued a formal apology, where appropriate, for the foreign service officers who were drummed out or had their careers
diminished by the McCarthy era. It appears that other than an AFSA event in the 70's, nothing has occurred. Each
individual seems to have a different story line- some resigned in protest, some dismissed, some reinstated by court but
never succeeded further in careers. The historian aims to have a memo for you by September. 6.
Wendy
