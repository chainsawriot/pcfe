Subject: Greek Coalition Negotiations

I spoke to both Mr. Samaras and Mr. Venizelos this morning. They both underscored the need to form
a coalition government as quickly as possible, and believe that this will likely consist of their two
parties (New Democracy and PASOK) as well as the Democratic Left. Right now, this would give the
new government roughly 179 seats in Parliament (out of a total of 300). The only difference between
the two is that Venizelos would prefer to go directly to the second round where all the party leaders
are called in for a meeting with the President and where it would be made crystal clear that SYRIZA is
unwilling to join a government of national unity. Once that has been established, he would then join
the coalition with New Democracy. In contrast, Samaras thinks this is a waste of time since SYRIZA has
already made clear that it will not join any coalition. Despite this difference, both men recognize
that it is essential to form a government as quickly as possible - if not today, then by tomorrow.

Both Samaras and Venizelos expressed their appreciation for the role that the USG has played
throughout this crisis and during the election campaign. Samaras added that the White House
statement on the election results was very helpful. They noted that they looked forward.to working
closely with the U.S. in the days and weeks ahead.
