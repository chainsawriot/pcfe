Subject: 15 detained in Serbia after US embassy attack (AP)


BELGRADE - (AP) Police say 15 people suspected of belonging to an extremist Islamic sect have been
detained in southern Serbia.
   The arrests in Sandzak early Saturday were made after a man from the Muslim-dominated region of Serbia
fire with an automatic weapon outside the U.S. Embassy in neighboring Bosnia Friday in what authorities called
a terrorist attack.
   A policeman and the gunman were wounded. The embassy said none of its employees was hurt.
   The shooter was identified as Mevlid Jasarevic from Novi Pazar, the administrative capital of Sandzak.
Serbian officials say he is the follower of the Wahhabis, a conservative Islamic sect that is rooted in Saudi
Arabia and linked to religious militants in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
   Serbian police say the raid in Sandzak was carried out by an anti-terrorist unit.
