Cheryl,



As I'm sure you're aware I've had the privilege of leading our Embassy through an extraordinary
period of transformation, including the move to normalize diplomatic relations and appoint an
ambassador, one of the important indicators of success. Much of the progress that we've seen
over the last few months is thanks to the game changing visit of the Secretary last December.




Regards,
Michael

 PS - I depart for Washington Friday morning but will have periodic access to email and can also

Things seem to be moving at warped speed in Burma â€” I hope they continue on a positive path.

Best.

Cheryl,

Since the Secretary's visit last December the pace of activity has only picked up. As I'm sure you
know there's a great deal of excitement out here over the April lrst election and what a good
election could mean for Burma/U.S. relations.

                                                                                                         you

Michael
