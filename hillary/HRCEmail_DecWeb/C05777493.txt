Just spoke with Joe Conason for first time. He sounds remarkably well, all things considered. Big relief.

Leaking diplomatic dispatches used to be a recognized diplomatic art. In the not


too distant past, American ambassadors in Central America or the Middle East

ignoring their cables would share them with correspondents, knowing that news


reports would have a better chance of reaching the secretary of state's desk


than almost any memo the ambassadors wrote themselves.


The very essence of diplomacy between nations in the old days—maybe even


yesterday—lay in knowing the difference between official communications,


unofficial. ones, and those that, being leaked, might be denied. (During the


American Civil War, the U.S. secretary of state once read a confidential


dispatch word for word to the correspondent for the London Times, just to make


sure the British foreign secretary got his point ... unofficially.) All of these

modes had their uses for signaling intent, saving face, or stepping back from a


brink. And they still do, as the 250,000 U.S. State Department cables that have


begun appearing on Wikileaks.ch amply demonstrate.


Video muted: click volume for sound Cartoonist Takes on WikiLeaks Animator Mark


Fiore examines the consequences of the whistleblower site's recent online


leaking of classified U.S government cables.


Inside State, in the ferocious competition for the attention of the secretary,


candor and accuracy were also part of the game. Cables with pithy descriptions


of Russia's president and prime minister as "Batman and Robin" are more likely


to be read than those that are blandly academic. And who can forget the cable


describing Libyan leader Muammar Kaddafi's Ukrainian nurse who travels


"everywhere with the leader." "The guy who wrote this had it nailed!" says a


veteran CIA officer who read the Kaddafi dispatch. "Without this kind of


writing, the cables would be dull as butter."


One of the great ironies of the latest WikiLeaks dump, in fact, is that the


industrial quantities of pilfered State Department documents actually show


American diplomats doing their jobs the way diplomats should, and doing them


very well indeed. When the cables detail corruption at the top of the Afghan


government, the Saudi king's desire to be rid of the Iranian threat, the


personality quirks of European leaders, or the state of the Russian mafiacracy,


the reporting is very much in line with what the press has already told the


    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777493 Date: 12/31/2015
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777493 Date: 12/31/2015




public. There's no big disconnect about the facts; no evidence—in the recent


cables at least—that the United States government is trying to deceive the


public or itself. And when it comes to taking action, far from confirming the


increasingly commonplace image of a waning superpower and a feckless State


Department, the WikiLeaks cables show that American diplomats draw on the full


range of tools at their disposal, the soft power of persuasion and the hard'


power of economic and even covert military action, especially in the fight


against Al Qaeda.


"Diplomacy is about a mix," says Joseph Nye, a former head of the National


Intelligence Council, who coined the term "soft power." ".The cables reveal how


effective most American diplomats really are." Do they always get what they


want? No. There are endless compromises and work-arounds. But Harvard's


cold-eyed realist Stephen M. Walt notes that the cables leaked so far show that,


still, "everybody around the world wants Uncle Sucker to solve their problems."


As Walt wrote on ForeignPolicy.com, "It is still striking how many pies the


United States has its fingers in, and how others keep expecting us to supply the


ingredients, do most of the baking, and clean up the kitchen afterwards." Sir


Christopher Meyer, former British ambassador to Washington, suggests with


typical reserve that "the chaps in the field are doing pretty well," while Roger


Cohen, the veteran foreign correspondent and columnist for The New York Times,


is absolutely frank in his admiration for the people writing those cables:

"Let's hear it for the men and women of the U.S. Foreign Service!"


But there's also a real risk that this slow-motion avalanche of 250,000


documents, 11,000 of them classified "secret," will diminish or destroy the


nuance at the heart of the diplomatic arts. The founder of WikiLeaks, Australian


computer hacker Julian Assange, claims he's acting in the interest of "justice"


and "transparency." "1 enjoy helping people who are vulnerable," he told Per


Spiegel last summer, "and I enjoy crushing bastards." But Ryan Crocker, the U.S.


ambassador who helped pull Iraq back from the edge of total chaos in 2007, sms


up a common view among diplomats when he says, "Assange is an anarchist-he's not


really interested in getting at important policy issues-just expose it all."


Assange finds discretion suspect, as if its sole purpose were to conceal


information. And it is certainly worth considering that argument, given the way


some American administrations used secrecy to lead the public astray with tragic


consequences in Vietnam, Nicaragua, and Iraq. But, in fact, the WikiLeaks


documents revealed so far show diplomats doing just the opposite: using their


reporting skills to try to illuminate the complexities of the countries where


they serve, and their negotiating skills to reduce the threat of war, whether


 with North Korea or in the Middle East.


 The Iranian case offers the most detailed and complex picture of American


 diplomacy revealed by WikiLeaks so far. China, Russia, Turkey, Arab allies, and


 European partners are all part of the picture. To push tougher sanctions on Iran


    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777493 Date: 12/31/2015

through the U.N. Security Council, for instance, the United States had o bring


Beijing on board. But China looks to Iran for critical supplies of oil. So the


Obama administration went to the Saudis. Did King Abdullah want Uncle Suo'ker Lo


"cut off the head of the snake" by unleashing a military strike? Well, maybe 1_


would be smarter for Abdullah to guarantee oil for China if Iran threatened to


cut off the supply following China's approval of tougher sanctions. The deal was


sealed. As president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations Les Gelb sums


up the strategy: "If the world wants to slow or.even -revent Iran's mar C! to


nuclear weaponry, this is a key path to doing so."


Despite the barrage of headlines shouting over how soar their relationship has


become, the cables reveal Washington and Moscow woring on intimate terms to


blunt Iran. The account of an exchange between top Russian and American


officials in February paints a portrait not oL Cold. War-era adversaries who can


barely sip vodka together, but of intelligence comrades coote ating closely. In


Washington, a member of        Russian Security Counciloffered          senior State


Department official a analysis of         an's latest efforts to improve the accuracy


and. range of its medium-range Shahab-3 ballistic missiles. A ranking member of


the FSE(Russia's intelligence service) reoounted how his agency uncovered sham


companies set up by both Iran and North Korea to buy military hardware such as


"measuring devices, high precision amplifiers, pressure indicators, various


composite materials, and technology to create new missile engi_nes." What's clea r

from such cables is that the much-discussed "reset" of American relations with


Russia has gone far deeper than just about anyone outside government understood.


The campaign to isolate Iran continued in Turkey. Also in February U.S. Defense


Secretary Robert Gates, whose CIA background includes a lot of diplomacy, met


with his counterpart in Ankara. In the run-up to the meeting, Turkish Prime


Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan had made public statements playing down concerns


over Iran's nuclear ambitions, saying they were just "gossip," but in the


private talks with the head of the Pentagon, the Turkish defense minister,


Mehmet Vecdi Gonul, dispensed with the posturing. Ankara was "concerned about


the Iranian threat," he said. And contrary to public statements by Turkish


officials playing down the need for a Europe-wide missile defense shield, the


murks and the U.S. appear in the cables to be horse-trading over possible sites


for a program on Turkish soil.


Gates pushed the point. He told the Turks that there was "a good chance" the


Israelis would take it upon themselves to strike militarily against Iran, and


suggested that Turkey might want to bolster its own defenses against Iranian


retaliations—a position much more alarmist than any senior American official has


taken in public, but also one useful to encourage tougher action by Ankara.


Has this diplomacy been successful in stopping Iran's nuclear program? Not so


far. But it may well have helped avert a war. Back in June 2009, Israeli Defense


Minister Ehud Barak was quoted in another of the leaked cables saving there were


    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777493 Date: 12/31/2015
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777493 Date: 12/31/2015




only six to 18 months left for military action that could stop or stall the


Iranian nuclear program. That deadline is now upon us, but the war is not. Of


course, covert action, presumably including the introduction of the


ultrasophisticated Stuxnet virus into Iran's computers, has also slowed the


program, but that's not covered in the WikiLeaks cables.


Indeed, the sheer volume of the WikiLeaks trove tends to give the impression


it's a complete picture of American diplomacy when, in fact, it's not. Thus even


The New York Times concluded that the cables at its disposal showed a lack of


depth, and a paucity of contacts, in the American reporting from Moscow. At one


level that may be true. But, then, the Times makes no mention of the fact that


one of Russia's most important spymasters defected to the United States last


summer, since the highly secret circumstances surrounding that case are not


included in Assange's relatively low-level dump.


One of the most sensitive pieces of information that did get exposure last week


was about what's already been reported in the press as a covert CIA program


targeting Al Qaeda in Yemen from the air. It's not really a secret that Yemen's


President Ali Abdullah Saleh has allowed this to go on, but he needed to be able


to deny it for internal political reasons. In many cultures in the world, lies


are acceptable, even when they are known to be lies, as a way to avoid


showdowns. But now we have Saleh quoted in an official State Department cable


telling U.S. Gen. David Petraeus last January, "We'll continue saying the bombs


    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777493 Date: 12/31/2015

are ours, not yours," followed by Yemen's deputy prime minister joking about


lying to the Yemeni Parliament. "That sort of thing strikes right at the heart


of a covert-action program where deniability is such an important thing," says


Michael Sheehan, a former State Department ambassador-at-large for


counterterrorism.


In the wake of such revelations, we can expect to see—or rather not see—even


more diplomatic traffic hidden away at higher classification levels. Ever since


the September 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, the government has


been fighting to break down the bureaucratic walls among agencies. Until then,


they kept their information in figurative "silos" or "stovepipes," and often


refused to share. That created massive blind spots that helped open the way for


Al Qaeda to attack. Since 9/11, some cable traffic has been distributed much


more widely. But in the wake of WikiLeaks, efforts already are underway to


curtail that practice. Last week the State Department reportedly cut off the


U.S. military's access to its Secret Internet Protocol Router Network, known as


SIPRNet, which is believed to have been the opening exploited by the leaker


feeding cables to Assange. And that's just the beginning of the internal


lockdown. "Sensitive meetings will get smaller," says Sheehan. "Less will be


said, and definitely less will be written. There will be a lack of candor. And


all of that will increase the chance of miscommunication."


The good job that American diplomats have been able to do in the last few years
