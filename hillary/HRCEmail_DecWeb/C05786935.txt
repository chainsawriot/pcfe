The Nasa Administrator has been seeking to see you since July. Lona has been deftly putting them
off given your schedule.

They have reached out to me

See below.

Yes, Ma'am. International space cooperation (which is an overall positive point in U.S. foreign policy efforts), new non-
traditional space partnerships in furtherance of the Administration's policies, and China-related issues, are probably the
chief items.

Thanks again.

Haller.

Hi, Cheryl! I appreciate Lona's reply, and wonder if you could ask her to get back to me next week with
suggestions for dates/times in December that might be good for a 30-minute meeting between Secretary Clinton
and the NASA Administrator? Thanks, as always.

 Thanks, Lona. No worries. I hope you will all get some much-needed rest from your most
 recent travels, too!


 We were thinking sometime in Deceniber for a quick meeting. Can we consider that, please?


 Thanks again.

        Good morning, Lona. I hope that this note finds you well.




        As you can see from the exchange below, the NASA Administrator, Gen. Bolden,
        will be the Guest of Honor for the Department of State's Marine Corps Birthday
        Celebration on November 3, 2011. I am wondering whether this might provide
        an opportunity for a brief meeting with the Secretary on that date, perhaps on the
        margins of the event at the State Department. If not, I would be grateful to
        receive your suggested dates on which the Secretary may be available between
        October and early 2012.



        Thank you, as always, for your assistance.

               personnel of the State Department in celebrating
               the 236th birthday of our Corps.
