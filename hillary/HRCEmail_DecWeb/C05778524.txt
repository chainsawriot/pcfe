Re; options. If actual transitional steps can be taken this part of crisis might begin to dissipate.

Re: Latest intel on Egypt and new options




I.                      New intel, based on Tyler Drumheller's sources:




1.        The army is staying out of the street fighting. The pro-Mubarak group


provoking the fighting is a small group of former security and police, quite


violent but not significant politically. The army is not getting involving.


2.        The army doesn't want to humiliate Mubarak. They will not force him to


do anything further. But a flashpoint looms. Egypt can only go for a few more

days before there is a food crisis. The army is central to food distribution.


Within days as a result of a food crisis the army will feel there must be a


resolution. In the meantime, the army will do not anything else. Mubarak has dug


in his heels. The army wanted him out, but will not do more against him. The


army remains in touch with Muslim Brotherhood, which is not driving the


revolution but waiting. The army is still in control.




II.                    New options




1.        The old constitution established that the president could be president


for life. Mubarak could call for a constitutional committee to be formed


immediately involving all elements of Egyptian politics to amend the


constitution abolishing that provision. Mubarak, in fact, mentioned this in his


speech, but failed to include any mechanism to realize it. Calling into being a


committee would build on what he has already said and begin to end his rule in


reality. He could announce that Suleiman would be head of the committee and


perhaps El Baradei would be vice chairman.


2.        After that announcement and movement begins toward the constitutional


committee, and only afterward, Suleiman and the committee could reach out to the


United Nations requesting that the UN would come in at the Egyptian request to


act as guarantors of free and fair elections and to reassure all elements in

Egypt that no party or group will have an unfair advantage. The Egyptians are


very sensitive about being seen as a Third World country or as a colony, looking


down upon by Europeans. So the international monitoring of the elections has to


come at the Egyptian requestâ€”and in sequence after the constitutional changes.
