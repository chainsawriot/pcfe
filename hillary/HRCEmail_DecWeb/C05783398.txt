DIYARBAKIR (Reuters) - Kurdish militants killed 26 Turkish soldiers near the border with Iraq on Wednesday, officials
said, in one of the deadliest attacks since the rebels took up arms against the Turkish state three decades
ago.      Turkish commandos crossed 3-4 km (1.9 to 2.5 miles) into northern Iraq in pursuit of the rebels following the
attacks in Cukurca and Yuksekova districts of Hakkari province, military sources said. At least 16 soldiers were also
wounded in the attacks.        The sources said there were sporadic clashes between the troops and Kurdistan Workers'
Party (PKK) rebels in the border area, while helicopter gunships overflew the site.       Turkish media reported Turkish
warplanes, which have launched retaliatory air strikes on Kurdish rebel targets in northern Iraq after past attacks, had
taken off from a base in the city of Diyarbakir.     Underlying the gravity of the situation, Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan
immediately cancelled a visit to Kazakhstan and convened an emergency meeting with the interior and defence
ministers, along with intelligence chiefs and top generals.      Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu also cancelled a
planned trip to Serbia on Wednesday.          President Abdullah Gul said: "The struggle will continue until this terror is
ended and everything will be done to finish the job." He said military commanders were travelling to the area. Turkey's
armed forces could not be reached for comment. The PKK did not immediately claim responsibility for the attacks.
