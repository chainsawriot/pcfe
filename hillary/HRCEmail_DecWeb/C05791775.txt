On another subject, Glyn just called. They now would like to put this statement out at 9 am tomorrow morning, 11 pm
Pyongyang time. That would be before your hearings tomorrow. They are prepared to supply you with everything you'll
need in the way of QA, but are worried about waiting because (1) it is starting to leak, and (2) the closer they get to the
LMB speech, the harder it will be to manage the ROKs.

I think it should be fine and you can be part of the story. But wanted to make sure you're okay.

We believe we may have positive movement from the court. Lawyers are on the way over to brief us. I don't want to
get hopes up. More later.
