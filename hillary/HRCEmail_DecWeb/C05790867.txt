Cheryl,

Just a quick note to let you know that Brett did a fully stellar job at today's hearing. Both Lugar and Risch indicated they
would support his nominees and thanked him repeatedly for his detailed and thoughtful answers. Casey opened the
hearing by allowing Brett to address his critics on management/ experience, which set the stage really nicely.
All in all, it was a great hearing.

Thanks,
Josh
