I haven't seen the details of the midwife announcement yet. Are you sure it's a done deal? Huma is pushing to get it
done so I'm copying her.

Also, I remember the Afghan woman cabinet rep at the dialogue saying they needed a network of doctors and hospitals,
not just midwives. Any progress on that front?

I wanted to tell you a few things about Afghanistan before you head off.




You have a major women's health announcement for the Kabul Conference. It was not easy to get it done working with
USAID, but it will make a difference.

It includes doubling midwives. We have been talking to GE (follow up to your conversation in Shanghai) and they are
considering what they might do there. It will take more weeks to figure that out but they are definitely interested.




As you may have seen, there have been a number of op eds this past week on the future of Afghan women. Human
Rights Watch released their report on guarantees for women in the reconciliation process. Tom Malinowski met with
Karzai this week, and I will send you his readout in a separate email.




You will be doing a meeting with Afghan women and the Danish FM (and maybe Lady Ashton) prior to your going to the
Conference. This will send a powerful signal to the women that their interests will continue to be represented at the
conference and beyond. There will be an Afghan woman from civil society speaking at the conference.




On the assistance front, you should know that there was a study done by SIGAR on the disposition of assistance
earmarked by Congress specifically for Afghan women. The report covers seven years, but notes that to the present day,
it is not clear how decisions get made and where the money has gone. We are attempting to put a process in place to
achieve a transparent and coordinated strategy for programs that benefit Afghan women that shows where the
resources are going, how the decisions are made and what is the actual impact of the assistance.
