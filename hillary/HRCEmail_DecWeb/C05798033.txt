Confidential fyi â€” going to try to talk to her quickly today and then longer week after next.

Subject: Re: Time to talk

I can wait. I have two issues. First, there are a few projects (e.g., Data 2X) which someone needs to follow post-
departure because they will get off track if we don't pay attention. I am happy to do that, but want to be sure I am
"authorized" to do that on her behalf.




I am going away from February 5 to 10, but am available other than that. Maybe we could grab lunch or coffee when life
is calmer.

Does it need to be pre-departure?

If so yes

 I've been trying to stay away but am wondering if you have a few minutes to talk before we leave.
