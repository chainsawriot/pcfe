AQAP Attack in Yemen

The United States strongly condemns today's attack against Yemeni military forces that killed over 70 soldiers and
wounded dozens more. We extend our deepest condolences to the friends and loved ones of the victims of this heinous
attack. The United States remains committed to counterterrorism efforts in Yemen and we will continue to support
President Hadi and the Yemeni people as they work to realize their aspirations for a brighter and more prosperous
future.
