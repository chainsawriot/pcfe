Subject:                       DOE, Energy and India



Just to illustrate the complexity at times to get a seat at the table: next week the Secretary will host
the Strategic Dialogue with India. There is a short session (a few minutes) on energy. Dan Poneman
will give the presentation on energy. I will not even be in the room.

As part of the India engagements next week, Wendy will host "Foreign Office Consultations" with the
Foreign Secretary, and I will participate in that. The Foreign Secretary specifically requested this after
my trip to India, He wanted to continue the discussion we had on energy security issues.

There is an Energy Dialogue that DOE has hosted with India since 2005. It precedes the Strategic
Dialogue. I could try to create a working group under that to continue our exchanges on Energy
Security, but I am not sure that this is the best course. Another option is just to keep meeting under
the auspices of Wendy's group. But there is still the issue of who speaks on energy when S convenes
these kinds of bilateral meetings. Right now, it is not the Energy Resources Bureau that she created.

I just wanted you to see that sometimes, even in our own building. It is not simple to undo the legacy
where DOE has had the primary (sometimes only) seat at the table on energy issues.
