Ms. Mills,



As the former United States Senator from Georgia and now Secretary of the American Battle Monuments
Commission, it's my privilege to write a personal recommendation for Mr.

     is highly respected by his colleagues for his willingness to help anyone at any time he can. He is very well organized
and detailed in all that he does. I found him to be consistently pleasant, tackling all assignments with dedication and a
smile.

He worked with an intensity that is admirable. He was a highly thoughtful and expressive communicator. He would make
a great asset to any organization or any government agency. Again, I'm honor to know him in my lifetime.

I highly recommend                  for employment.                                                                                                                     B6


Sincerely,




Max Cleland
Secretary
