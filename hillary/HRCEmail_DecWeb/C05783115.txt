POLITICO Breaking News

Embattled White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley has asked his deputy Pete Rouse to take over some of the day-
to-day functions of the West Wing to smooth operations, a move that has been in the works for several weeks,
according to senior administration officials.

Daley had come under fire internally for his management style and recent comments he made to POLITICO's
Roger Simon in an interview that was granted without clearance from the White House communications staff,
according to administration officials. Rouse previously served as Obama's interim chief of staff. The news of
Daley's revised role was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.
