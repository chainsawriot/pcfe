UN's Annan: Iran should be part of Syria solution
GENEVA (AP) -- U.N. envoy Kofi Annan says he believes Iran should be involved in efforts to end the violence in Syria.

Annan says he is working to convene a so-called ' contact group' meeting on Syria in Geneva on June 30.

The United States has vehemently opposed the involvement of Iran demanded by Russia.

Annan says the composition of the meeting is one of the sticking points that may not be resolved until next week.

The former U.N. secretary-general told reporters in Geneva on Friday that        "I have made it quite clear that I believe
Iran should be part of the solution."
