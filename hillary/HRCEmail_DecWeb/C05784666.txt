Worth skimming the below, which basically amounts to Panetta saying he (somewhat desperately) wants to
announce any Libya wounded warrior initiative.

CAPT Kirby, a pleasure to e-meet you.

We're appreciative of Pentagon's great progress on this issue. It obviously remains the highest priority for the new Libyan
government and a great opportunity for the U.S. to demonstrate post-conflict commitment.

Please let me know if I can be of any assistance. In Washington until Friday: jaredcaplan

CC'ing Ambassador Cretz, Tripoli.

Best,
Jared Caplan
PAO Tripoli

Jared, this is to introduce you to CAPT John Kirby of my team -- he is Pentagon spokesman and point of contact on ongoing
developments on likely US medical assistance initiative for Libya. We're aware this likely won't be finalized until Thursday -- but
Secretary Panetta will want to be the one to announce it, since the idea originated with him. John, Jared is PAO Tripoli for the
Embassy and a longtime friend.

Jared, I bcc'd you on the email below.

Best,

Doug

Subject: Libya - Medical Assistance

We believe Secretary Panetta remains interested in announcing any medical assistance initiative we will be taking re Libya. He would
be able to do so with the press now travelling with him on the Asia trip. We are following developments on this through AFRICOM
and USD/P. Tom Davis at AFRICOM will handle any press issues in theatre. John Kirby is OSD/PA's point of contact on this, and
will need to know if/when we are ready to make any announcement; he will work through George Little, travelling with SecDef, to get
appropriate TPs and context to the Secretary. We are, of course, holding for green lights from appropriate entities -- but just wanted to
remind you all of this so SecDef is the one announcing rather than reading about it.

Many thanks,

Doug
