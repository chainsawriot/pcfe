Dear Heather and Cheryl,




Thanks again for nominating me to the East-West Center Board. I had a long meeting with the Center President
when he was in Washington recently, and I look forward to my first Board Meeting in Honolulu later this week.
I've promised Heather a report on my return.

My very best regards to you both, along with the Secretary,
Margaret

Margaret Carpenter
