Great. I just spoke with Phil and he agreed that we can work in some additional language on institutional reform with a
proviso to the effect of "Secretary Gates will have more to say about this subject when he speaks to you tomorrow."

Best,
Tomicah

Thanks. I'll wait for the next draft. I'm in no hurry since we're in good shape and agree we need to be sure all views are
heard first.

Is the speech now being reviewed? I think the basics are there, aitho I am aware that every word will be parsed. Also, I
think we should endorse institutional reform to support that agenda.
