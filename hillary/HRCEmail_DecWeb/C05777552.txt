As you wish. You just need to understand that I can explain to the press corps that I work with every day why I am not in
Azerbaijan. It is about diplomacy and not headlines. It is very difficult to explain why the State Department spokesman is
not present at a direct negotiation between the Palestinians and the Israelis, one of the administration's highest
priorities and an event at which there will be a significant number of media. Whether we have a lot to say or a little to
say, this will be a global media event and the State Department spokesman will not be there. I do understand our
strategy, that we are going to keep our words sparse, given the sensitivity of the negotiations. And to one journalist
from the paper of record who said he assumed I would be on the trip. When I hesitated and said I was not sure and then
explained that we were making a deliberate calculation regarding our PD strategy, he then remarked that this means the

undermines the trip and ultimately the Secretary. I am a team player and will remain a team player, but this is a decision
that comes with a cost, including my credibility as the spokesman.

Have we arrived at a decision? I believe based on what the President said in his news conference — laying out that we
have asked the PM explicitly to extend the moratorium — will yield significant coverage here tomorrow and a reaction in
the region. This has PD implications for the meetings. What does the Secretary want me to do — be there to help with
messaging or stay here? My vote is to be there, but at this stage I just need to know.
