Re: Latest intel on Egypt and new options




   I.         New Intel, based on Tyler Drumheller's sources:

   1. The army is staying out of the street fighting. The pro-Mubarak group provoking the fighting is a small
      group of former security and police, quite violent but not significant politically. The army is not getting
      involving.
   2. The army doesn't want to humiliate Mubarak. They will not force him to do anything further. But a
      flashpoint looms. Egypt can only go for a few more days before there is a food crisis. The army is
      central to food distribution. Within days as a result of a food crisis the army will feel there must be a
      resolution. In the meantime, the army will do not anything else. Mubarak has dug in his heels. The army
      wanted him out, but will not do more against him. The army remains in touch with Muslim Brotherhood,
      which is not driving the revolution but waiting. The army is still in control.

   II.        New options

             1. The old constitution established that the president could be president for life. Mubarak could call
                 for a constitutional committee to be formed immediately involving all elements of Egyptian
                 politics to amend the constitution abolishing that provision. Mubarak, in fact, mentioned this in
                 his speech, but failed to include any mechanism to realize it. Calling into being a committee
                 would build on what he has already said and begin to end his rule in reality. He could announce
                 that Suleiman would be head of the committee and perhaps El Baradei would be vice chairman.

 2. After that announcement and movement begins toward the constitutional committee, and only
     afterward, Suleiman and the committee could reach out to the United Nations requesting that the
     UN would come in at the Egyptian request to act as guarantors of free and fair elections and to
     reassure all elements in Egypt that no party or group will have an unfair advantage. The
     Egyptians are very sensitive about being seen as a Third World country or as a colony, looking
     down upon by Europeans. So the international monitoring of the elections has to come at the
     Egyptian requestâ€”and in sequence after the constitutional changes.
