Dear Cheryl and Paul,
I just witnessed a moment I had to share. Martelly introduced himself to Desmond Tutu and Archbishop Tutu said to
him, "You were the first black country to set yourself free. You inspired us."

Your joint work on Haiti will ultimately lead to a new round of inspiration for the world.

Best,
Tjada
