I spoke w President Colom today. He said they had lost 44 people and have considerable damage including bridges that
have washed away. Fortunately the rains stopped today-- although he is very concerned about the upcoming rainy
season.


                                                                                                    -- the Embassy
provided 3 NAS helos (with a team of 19 emergency workers) for emergency response to the flooding and landslides .

President Colom expressed his gratitude for Embassy support. I took advantage of the call to also tell him that we have
reprogrammed $4.38m to Guatemala for reconstruction for which he was also very grateful.

As you may know President Colom has repeatedly asked whether he might be able to get a meeting w the President--




We think that a meeting is impt not only because of Guatemala's key role in the Merida plus initiative and the fragility of
Guatemalan institutions-- but also because of the up-coming revelations of the Cutler study-- (the Tuskegee like
experiments in Guatemala). It strikes us that we will be in a better position to react to that damaging news (with its
negative connotations beyond the bilateral relationship) within the context of a clear and positive engagement w
Guatemala.

President Colom said that he will be at UNGA on the 19 or 20th and I intend to see him then-- perhaps if a POTUS
meeting does not materialize you might consider whether such a meeting could fit into your schedule.

Best Regards,

Arturo
