Subject: Serious Incident at APEC

Heads up:

At 0245 today local in Honolulu an off-duty DS agent there TDY for APEC was involved in trying to break up an
altercation at a McDonalds, during which he drew his weapon and shot an individual, killing him. The agent is in the
custody of the Honolulu PD. We have agents on the spot assisting in the investigation, and others there separately to
support the agent. It does not look good: the agent was the ony one involved in the altercation who had a weapon, and
                                 HPD has lead, FBI is also involved.

Kurt Tong and Lynn Dent are aware. We have provided brief note to Ops Ctr simply saying we're aware of the incident
and investigation is under way.

That's all I have for now. More as I get it. I                                  Back in DC tomorrow Sunday.
