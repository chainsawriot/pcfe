The actual statement from Der Zeitung: "We should not have published the altered picture, and we
have conveyed our regrets and apologies to the White House and to the State Department."

The publisher Albert Friedman has apologized publicly, noting that the paper should not have altered an official WH
photo. He was interviewed by CNN and CNN reports that Friedman has called the White House and State Department
to apologize (not sure who he called). Friedman said he has nothing against the Secretary. He said that the paper should
simply not have published the photo (rather than distort it) in accordance with their "religious belief on modesty" and
showing women.

Ben:

As you may have heard, a conservative New York based newspaper, Der Zeitung, photo-shopped
Secretary Clinton and Audrey Tomason out of the Sit Room Bin Laden photo. Not only is this totally
outrageous, it is unacceptable and a clear violation of White House regulations concerning the use
of official photos. I am requesting that the White House issue a formal complaint to Der Zeitung and
request an apology to Secretary Clinton and Ms. Tomason.

Thanks for your help.

Judith
