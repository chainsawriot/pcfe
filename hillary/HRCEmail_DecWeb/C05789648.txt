Subject:

  Dear Cheryl,
  Thank you for the invitation to participate in the Global Chief of Mission Conference earlier this week. It was
  quite impressive and I was honored to represent the business community during this important discussion.

  As I mentioned during the panel, we serve customers and clients in more than 100 countries, and our
  relationships with our US embassies and consulates in those countries are incredibly important to us. Your
  team and those abroad in our mission to advance the interests of the United Sates are critical partners and
  they can help smooth the way for US companies to excel in their activities.

  If we can help the embassy staff in any way to understand better the issues we face, expand their industry
  expertise, provide our own insights, help partner in an endeavor or help to represent US capabilities and
  commitment to the country, please do not
  hesitate to call on us.
  I look forward to seeing you again soon and do hope you will thank the Secretary for our nice conversation
  over lunch.

Best,
Anne
