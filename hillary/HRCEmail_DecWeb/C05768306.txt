Glenn-- thanks. I'm just leaving the airport where we had a very positive arrival ceremony with MOD, senior army and
FACh officials, and MFA. Good coverage on ABC news and CNN. I highlighted the quick response time and the near
doubling of airbridge capability to hard hit Concepcion which these aircraft provide. Thanks again! Paul.

Sir,

Your two C-130s landed safe at Arturo Merino Benitez International Airport in Santiago, Chile at 1858 and 1905Z. They will
integrate into FACh's operations and will be available to fly relief missions tomorrow morning.

VR,
Glenn
