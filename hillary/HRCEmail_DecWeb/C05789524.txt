           still has not cleared L/Ethics.


           already has her DS clearance, ID badge and email address. So we are ready to go as soon as they clear her.

Katy/Rich are aware this is a priority for us to move, but having difficulty getting the General Counsel to respond. I have
reached out t           to make sure she is aware of hold up and can help push this.

Thx

L/Ethics is still reviewing. They are aiming to have the clearance completed end of this week/early next week, but
understand her form is complicated and L did not have the position description to review it against until last week.

In the meantime _is coming in for a security briefing on Wednesday and asked if she could get any briefing
materials to bring her up to speed. I reached out to Kamala on this.
