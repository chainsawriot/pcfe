It was great to hear your voice, but I was frustrated with myself for not having turned on the cell ringer after a meeting,
so missed you. I will watch it like a hawk, so pls try whenever convenient for you. Mobile should reach me anywhere.

I am enjoying engaging with State on the Summit on Impact Investing being organized by Kris B.'s team, led by an
outstanding young AID Foreign Service Officer, Lala Faiz. A small planning session 1/20 has maxed at 70, with key private
sector, government and ngos nationwide clamoring to get in. Assetmark founder Ron Cordes, who sold his firm to
Genentech and now is dedicated fulltime to advancing impact investing (CGI commitment 2010), young California
venture capitalist and prof Sean Foote and I are Lala's "kitchen cabinet". Very exciting and good, even at a distance, to
be working to further your goals.

Your internal message to the State team beginning 2011 was inspirational -- so right to start with Amb Holbrooke. What
a loss and a tragedy. To see in print the scope of your travel in 2010 alone was staggering. I really, really hope you can
address the Skoll World Forum in Oxford end of March this year. The social entrepreneurs Skoll convenes and supports
are truly the "foot soldiers" for building economies that work for all, and that create the kind of opportunity that
engenders stability and peace. You'd love the energy and the inspiration of the Skoll convening. Jeff Skoll is making this
his life's work.

I mourn the dissolution of ShoreBank, but the two banks continue to operate under new ownership as mission-focused
CDFIs, and the affiliates spun out as independent entities. Most of them continue strong. ShoreBank International,
where I am now full-time, is in final stages of switching out SBK holding company ownership with new investors. The first
investor will internationalize our ownership in tremendously positive way. SBI CEO & President Laurie Spengler is a star
who reminds me of you, and it's gratifying to be part of building her top management team.

I truly hope 2011 is opening in great health, happiness and some balance (I) for you and Bill and all the family.

Jan
