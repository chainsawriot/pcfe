Subject: Update on marking strategy for USAID grantees in Pakistan




Quick note to update you on our discusssions with the 11 USAID grantees who joined InterAction's letter proposing an
alternative marking strategy for Pakistan.




As you know, we denied InterAction's proposal and told the 11 grantees that we would discuss their particular
marking strategies with each of them separately.




7 of the 11 grantees now have compliant marking strategies. Discussions with 4 grantees continue, but we are hopeful
that all will agree to a compliant strategy.




Thanks for your support. Mark
