Saw Levitte for an hour this morning at Elysee and Alliot-Marie's chief of staff (now wondering what his boss' departure
tomorrow will bring) at Quai last night. Highlights:

On Libya, French strongly supportive of our measures, rapid move in same direction by EU, and earliest possible UNSCR
(ideally before Monday). I made clear we would not oppose ICC and support strong accountability provisions. Levitte
repeated Fr concerns on NATO role. Believes Qadhafi's fall or exit "matter of days.". Convinced UN should play main
organizing role for support for post-Q Libya, wants to work with us on concept. Need to find solid Arab (ideally) head of .
mission. Recognizes all huge challenges.

Quai focused mostly on getting 30 remaining Fr diplomats out of Tripoli today via mil airfield, and we talked about our
experience.

Levitte positive about Egypt and Tunisia, acknowledging that we should coordinate our support. Concerned about
Algeria, but no easy answers, more optimistic about Morocco. Doesn't think this is time to lean on Mor re W Sahara, too
much else unsettled in region.

Big push from Levitte on peace process. Said Euro conviction growing that we need to move boldly, lay out vision for A-I
peace as part of broader strategy for supporting pol and econ change in region. Said EU and US should coordinate
ambitious approach to Maghreb, Egypt and perhaps others on liberalized trade. Only way to encourage healthy
economies and bolster pol transitions, while avoiding migration pressures that EU govts can't cope with. Wants to talk
more with us. Still hopes for Quartet Min in Paris on margins of G8 FMs.

Levitte said Sarko Turkey visit yday "not easy". Tough on EU accession and Iran. L said Fr moving asap re SWIFT steps and
think this is key moment to tighten sanctions. Not optimistic re March BOG res, had heard same neg vibes from
Prikhodko that I heard from Ryab.

L very upbeat in gent on improvements in rels with Russia, believes MD and WTO main opportunities for 2011.
