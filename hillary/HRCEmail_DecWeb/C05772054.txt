cheryl:
  first and most, my great thanks to you and hillary for sticking by dick these last two years. it meant everything to him
(and me) in an otherwise messy universe.nwhom i've known and worked with for decades, is interested in a senior
engergy positon in the department. he has the whole package of skillsâ€”strategic/policy, bureaucratic and diplomatic.

 superb strate ically and in diplomatic and bureaucratic skills, and he's a joy to work with. Along with his strong
background at             he has a track record of fighting for the very energy measures that motivate this administration.
Happy to talk futher. lesgelb P.S.
