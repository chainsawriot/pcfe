I spoke to Eugene yesterday who told me that
                          Eugene's understanding is that
                                                                           hence the email circulated last night.
Eugene and I agreed that we should meet with DHS either Monday or Tues to move this along asap. As mentioned, I am
travelling Tues-Frid.

David; please can you followup with Eugene and DHS to set meeting time? Please email if you need me. I will be on
blackberry.

Thanks all!
Julissa
