Distinguished Service Awards are unique in that they are granted at the Secretary's initiative and discretion without
going through any other kind of meritorious review process. If someone in the Department believes the Secretary
should consider someone for the award, the FAM directs sending a memo to the Executive Secretary to bring to the
Secretary's attention. Since I have been in this job, I've received two such recommendations:



                                                                  After consultation, we determined that the
Secretary's Distinguished Honor Award (which requires review by the Department's awards committee, which provided
approval this week) would be more appropriate. That was based on my sense that the Distinguished Service Award is
more appropriate as a person wraps up his/her career in the federal government, and that a Distinguished Honor Award
who makes a significant contribution to US foreign policy interests over a more limited scope.

I'll look into what other awards have gone out before I arrived.                               I'll see who   B6
others received them.

Hi Cheryl,

Today we received Marc Grossman's nomination of Karl Eikenberry to receive the Secretary's Distinguished
Service Award (the same one she gave to Anne-Marie and Jim Steinberg).
