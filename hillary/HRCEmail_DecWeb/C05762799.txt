UPDATE (May 29):               is under consideration, but the appointment is not a done deal. Apparently he has
been asked to fill out a raft of background forms (one involves listing all the foreign nationals a candidate
encountered over a period of years, an endeavor that would take             the length of Obama's first term).




                          - one people who follow the appointments process down here know is very much par
for the course.
