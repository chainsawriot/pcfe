Subject: Scots police, UK govt to meet over Libyan defector (Reuters)

LONDON, April 3 (Reuters) - British officials will meet Scottish prosecutors on Monday to arrange a police
interview with Libyan defector Moussa Koussa over the Lockerbie bombing, British Foreign Secretary William
Hague said.

   Former Libyan foreign minister Koussa fled to Britain from war-torn Libya on Wednesday in a public
relations coup for Western governments who are backing rebel attempts to oust Gaddafi from power.

   Families of some of the 270 people who died when Pan Am flight 103 exploded over the southern Scottish
town of Lockerbie in 1988 have demanded that Koussa -- a former Libyan spy chief -- should be handed over to
Scottish investigators immediately.

   Scottish police have asked to quiz Koussa, who has been in contact with British officials in an undisclosed
location.

  "My officials are discussing with the Crown Office (Scottish prosecutors) tomorrow how to go about that,"
Hague told the BBC on Sunday. "We want more information about past events."

   The. Scottish government, a devolved body, has faced intense criticism for freeing the only person convicted
for the bombing. Libyan Abdel Basset al-Megrahi was allowed to return home in 2009 because he was judged
to be terminally ill with cancer.

    Koussa is believed to have played a key role in the release of Megrahi, who is still alive.

    Scotland's justice minister Kenny MacAskill said the interview could potentially lead to further prosecutions.

  "It's never been suggested by anybody that the Lockerbie bombing was carried out by one man alone,"
MacAskill said.

   The British government has said no deal is on the table for anyone from Gaddafi's regime, emphasising that
those on British soil remain subject to UK law.

   "There will be no immunity -- he (Koussa) hasn't asked for that," Hague said. "He's not under arrest but he is
having discussions with my officials and it's important that those discussions are able to continue."

   Hague, who has spoken to Koussa, said he would update parliament on Monday and try to give more details
on the Libyan's defection and his meetings with UK officials.

    Britain's Conservative-led government, in power since May 2010, has condemned Megrahi's release and
criticised the previous Labour administration for restoring ties with Libya in return for Gaddafi ending his
pursuit of banned weapons.
