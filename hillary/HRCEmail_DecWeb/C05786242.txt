Madam Secretary,

Thank you for giving me this opportunity as we begin the new year. It is always a privilege to be a small part of making
history and trying to help you create a more secure and prosperous world. Your team is great and it is a pleasure to work
with them.

I leave tomorrow afternoon for Riyadh and then on to Emirates. If a certain traveler travels, will also stop in Yemen in
between though likely will be postponed. So will be back Thursday or Friday morning depending. I think Bill and Jake are
briefed on everything from holidays but, of course, am available by phone this weekend or from abroad by regular or
secure phone as needed.

I hope you have caught a few rays of family and sun in between many calls, and moments of memory of your mother,
and that you, President Clinton, Chelsea, Mark and your whole family have a wonderful new year.

Best,
Wendy
