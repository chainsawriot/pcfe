Subject:                            We will always have Paris..



Greetings, the last time we saw each other was Paris, I believe, right after the fall of Qaddafi. Although Libya is still
messy, I think your efforts to keep the world's focus on removing Qaddafi and helping avoid a slaughter there
last year will be long remembered.




       In any event, in Paris I mentioned the possibility of arranging some off the record events with key journalists and
influential types for you in your last year as Secretary of State. Although Bloomberg is not the right place for it any
more, I am also President of the Atlantic Partnership in NYC and Washington, which could be a perfect venue for such
events, if you are still interested.

In the meantime, I did want to ask you about coming to see you in Washington in connection with my work for Andrew,
in order to promote some international opportunities for the State of New York, for which I hope you still have a soft
spot. I have also heard from some colleagues that you have set up a foreign affairs board analogous to the Pentagon's
Defense Policy Board.




                               In any event, I hope I can get in to see you in Washington, or if it suited you better, on
one of your rare downtimes in New York.

Best regards, your friend,

Jamie
