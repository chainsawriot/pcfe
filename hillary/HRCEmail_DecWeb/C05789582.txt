Steve just called me to report on his phoner with Jim. Steve made a yeomanly but unsuccessful effort to get Jim
to attend the meeting, then discussed with Jim how his views on Iran could be reflected. Jim said he'd call me
and give me his views over the phone and I'm welcome to pass them along to the group. That's fine by me,
although let's see what he has to say and, among ourselves, decide whether it's worth my being the messenger
(among other things, it will take up time from people who are actually in attendance, it calls attention to Jim's
absence, potentially in both respects creating an undesirable precedent. Then, it turns out, Steve offered up to
Jim the idea of phoning in for the Iran discussion. I told Steve I found that exceedingly unlikely, given that the
whole discussion is classified, and I can't imagine that Jim's got a STU-III (or whatever you folks use these
days)â€”and, once again, even if it were permissible, it could be more disruptive than contributory. Long/short, I
promised to pass along the idea, but left Steve with my view that it was highly unlikely.
