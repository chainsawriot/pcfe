Subject: FW: Urgent UNGA Resolution to be Introduced Monday

PIs see below, just received from Amb Rice, regarding Arab League intent to move forward with a GA resolution on
Palestinian statehood:



An Arab leader has informed me in confidence that the Arab League will introduce UNGA resolution on Monday making
Pal an observer state. The PA is not driving this, an Arab initiative despite parallel effort in UNSC. They expect some Euro
votes (ie Norway and the solid pro-Pal. EU). Don't seem interested in negotiating to get more. They seek a vote next
week.
