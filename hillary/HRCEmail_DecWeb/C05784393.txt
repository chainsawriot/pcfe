Dear Madame Secretary:

I have just returned from South Sudan and Sudan. The situation in the border states of South Kordofan and Blue Nile
(the Two Areas) remains precarious with ongoing fighting and no near prospects of political talks. A potential
humanitarian crisis is looming there that will pose serious political choices for us and our allies.




           Meanwhile the economic situation in Sudan is becoming serious as foreign exchange earnings are down, the
Sudanese pound is depreciating, and prices are rising. Small sporadic demonstrations about economic hardships have
taken place, though not posing yet any serious political threat.

The Two Areas. Fighting in Southern Kordofan has quieted somewhat as the GOS focuses on a renewed offensive in Blue
Nile.

        Reports of serious food shortages in both the Two Areas and estimates of several hundred thousand people
displaced creates fear of a colossal humanitarian disaster in the near future. The GOS has however allowed no
international agency to reach the areas under SPLA control where most of the danger exists. Pressure is growing for
initiating a cross-border assistance program without approval of the GOS. But the GOS has threatened strong retaliation,
against NGOs operating elsewhere in Sudan such as Darfur, and even closing embassies if this happens.
                                            Nevertheless, we are doing contingency planning shou s t is set e on y way
to avoid disaster. I have pressed the GOS on the need for it to open access to an international humanitarian agency and
warned them of this growing pressure for cross-border aid. I have enlisted the Africa Union, the Government of Qatar,
and our European allies all to press the GOS on this matter.

                                                                                                                     1.4(D)
                                                                                                                     B1




Darfur. More promising the GOS will launch its new peace agreement this week with the small Liberty and Justice
Movement (UM). While most armed groups in Darfur have not signed on to this agreement, it will test the readiness of
the GOS to make significant progress on reconciliation, compensation to victims, and other steps toward peace. Qatar
has staked much on this agreement which was negotiated in Doha. The Qatari Deputy Prime Minister is accompanying
the UM leader on his initial post-agreement tour in Darfur, and Qatar is putting up significant sums to finance the
agreement.

                                                                                           We have urged the armed
movements to put far more emphasis on a political platform for negotiation and will host a workshop on Darfur in
November to which the UM and the other armed groups are expected to participate.




He asked for a written copy of all my remarks in the meeting on US policy in Sudan, which I presume he will distribute to
other officials.

Next steps. We will be facing several weeks of more fighting in the Two Areas, and slow progress on north-south issues
as both countries assess their policies and each other's strengths, and as anti-government fiehters test their ability to
provoke an "Arab Spring" in Sudan and topple the Bashir regime.
