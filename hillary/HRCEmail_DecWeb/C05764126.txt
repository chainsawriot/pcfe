This is from a woman in S/P who is a veteran of USAID. She raises some interesting points, particularly about the
coui itry-driven model and how it would apply in certain tricky cases. You probably have already thought about all of this
but I wanted to put it in front of you in case you haven't.

Lissa,

Fl.!qher to my bullets of yesterday, I'd like to get a couple of issues with nuances in front of you for when/if they are
          r.rt- ,)pirg for the Secretary's development speech:

AcctowiteAity: Ter ae:ms to be a call for greater accountability within our foreign assistance. Pis know that the US
                     (all sources) are the most assiduously managed aid programs in the world, in terms of financial
accountability. We are almost TOO careful to assure the proper flow and use of US taxpayers' dollars. So, if there's a
need to speak about accountability, we should emphasize increasing accountability for outcomes or impacts. Such a
commitment will require lengthening the span for results monitoring a bit and definitely improve rebuilding our

signing die         Declaration and its successor declarations, but has not moved in lock step with a number of donors (EU,
UK and European bilaterals, etc. to reconcile our assistance modalities to it.* However, implementing "local

Latin America (\Venezuela, Bolivia, Nicaragua and Ecuador), it could undermine real democratic development to hand
over "ownei.snip" to populist centralizers.... but these leaders are currently draping themselves in the Paris Declaration
fie;.:.ipping tree pressure on our embassies and USAID missions to channel everything through their systems. Similar
pressures are lelt in countries with corrupt governments in Africa. SO, we need to be sure the Secretary speaks of "local

have to happen along with the infrastructural ones.

Thanks for listening. Hope this helps in some small way.

Best, Tish
