                              November 15, Marshall Center

  CONTEXT

  Having signed the US-Tunisia Political and Economic Partnership last week, the
  enclosed conference proposal will fulfill one of the main objectives of the joint
  declaration announced this week (attachment 1), which reads in part:
         To galvanize the interests of potential investors in the Tunisian market, the
         Governments intend to undertake events that link potential investors to the
         Tunisian diaspora who are, indeed, among the best and most genuine exemplars
         of the benefits of doing business in Tunisia. To that end, the U.S. Overseas
         Private Investment Corporation intends to explore how to catalyze significant new
         American private sector investment in Tunisia, including expansion of small-to-
         medium enterprise lending, as well as opportunities in franchising, infrastructure,
         and renewable resources and clean technology in the country.

  Hosted by Special Representative Balderston, Ambassador Taylor, A/S Fernandez,
  OPIC CEO Littlefield, and other senior USG officials, this conference will bring
  together 300 US investors who are interested in deepening ties with Tunisia. A
  preliminary list will draw from the US Chamber of Commerce, Arab-American
  Chamber of Commerce, Jim Zogby's network through Partners for a New
  Beginning, the Tunisian American Young Professionals network, and the list of
  companies currently doing business in Tunisia (attachment 3). Secretary Clinton
  will conclude the day's session with closing remarks.
