Hi Cheryl.

Thank you for working with and supporting us on the VPs visit to LA.

We have 6 US Governors and 7 Party Secretaries\Governors from China that will engage with the VPs on Friday.

It has been interesting all around. We are not dancing in the end zone yet, but I believe tomorrow we will cross a major
milestone on efforts regarding subnational cooperation.

We spent some valuable time with Governor Brown and his team today and at dinner tonight. He may be in DC next
week to attend his first NGA meeting since being elected and his staff is looking at getting him to come to the
Department for a briefing.

This would be huge all around - to be able to get him to focus on something other than the budget - we know is a
monumental feast. Will keep you posted.

Looking forward to sharing when I get back and to getting on your calendar for drinks\dinner to discuss all.

Thanks again,

Reta Jo
