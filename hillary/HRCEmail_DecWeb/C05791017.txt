Dear Monica:

When convenient, would you print this cover email and the attachments in the order attached so that when I connect
with the Secretary she has the benefit of this background?

Thank you.

HRC:

I am sharing this traffic with you so you have background for us to discuss the best approach given the overture by
Secretary Chu on how to coordinate State and Energy efforts.

Best.

Carlos

I am happy to take the lead in working our positioning through w/ DOE if that is beneficial.




So welcome your recommendation - and if the second option fully reflects your best recommendation.

Cheryl, Jake, Huma:

This chain starts with an email from Secretary Chu to the Secretary following up on their meeting last week. It proposes
a Clinton-Chu memo to guide staff on international energy coordination. David Sandalow forwarded to me a copy of the
memo.




I would appreciate your guidance on what you think is most constructive way to move forward.

You probably have this through other channels, but just in case.

Dear Hillary,

Attached is a first draft of a memo that talked about during our recent breakfast. It is meant to be a high level
message that we should be sending out to members of our respective departments to insure that we cooperate
and collaborate in the best way possible, leaving the details to our assistant secretaries and others.

Comments and modifications are welcome.

Cheers,

Steve
