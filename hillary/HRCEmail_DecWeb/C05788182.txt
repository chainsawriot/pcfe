I spent over an hour with    mother and father today. Briefed on what we are doing to get       home but was very
realistic about odds for success. They were very happy with our effort.
We talked about other ideas if the               fails.

They had been on the Hill yesterday and were off to see Sen Kerry later this afternoon.
