Yes, which would mean you likely would not be in DC/office on Monday July 2nd and Tuesday July 3rd. I have nothing set
for you on either day to give you that option but found out on late Friday that there is one video we should do tomorrow
to give you that flexibility. (The UK family planning conference that we signed off on, the UK minister mentioned to you
at the USAID event.) We can work in for tomorrow.

And I'd like to leave tonight around 9:30.

Also, Bill and I are thinking that we will come down for the 4th of July event on the 8th floor but not sure yet so pls don't
share until we've discussed.

That would mean I would fly to NY once I return from Europe and then need a plane to fly back noon--2pm to Andrews.

Would that work?
