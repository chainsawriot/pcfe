AbZ was in Damascus on Sunday. He saw Bashar one-on-one. Bashar told him that he had "had it"
with Hamas, and that Hamas had put ridiculous conditions on reconciliation with Fatah. Bashar
acknowledged that he has differences with Abu Mazen, but that Abu Mazen is an honest, decent,
and honorably person, in comparison to Mishal. He also told AbZ that he wants to host Abu Mazen in
Damascus, in part to show Hamas that Bashar doesn't need them.

So this makes me think that the Syrians told Hamas to sign. And this is what Abu Mazen has said all
along: that he signed, and he wouldn't accept reservations or amendments, and that the burden is
on Hamas to sign. Basically, Abu Mazen probably thinks he was in the right all along and didn't
blink. Abu Mazen, for all we know, may not have even known that reconciliation would happen
today.

Dan Arbel just called me to get our reaction and to note what Bibi has said so far. I went through our
press guidance with Dan, and described to him the general outlines of what we understand to be in
the deal. I said we will study the details carefully when we get them, but it is clear even now that
there will be implications for the MEP and our bilateral relations with the Pals, assuming this deal goes
through. I did add, noting that I wasn't speaking on instructions but only offering a preliminary view,
that we continue for now to deal with the current PA government headed by Abu Mazen and Salam
as we have before. Echoing our talking point on Lebanon, I said that we'll evaluate a new
government once it is formed, and there may be consequences in our relationship, but we will cross
that bridge when we come to that. And I added, again as a preliminary view, that we would
encourage the GOI to do the same. Dan said he appreciated the comments and would convey
them. He said the preliminary GOI view is that this is yet another aspect of a disturbing trend among
the Palestinians: the conditions on returning to negotiations, the drive for unilateral action in NY in
September, and now this.

A very quick reaction:

Two elements of this have a direct bearing on U.S.-Pal relations: 1) the security forces, and 2) the
composition on the government. On the first, the deal described below sounds ok, i.e. there will be
separate security forces in Gaza and the West Bank. On the second, it's not so good. A government
of independents, will still have to meet Quartet principles for us to provide direct assistance. A
government without a political program is a problem if there is no affirmative affirmation of Q
principles. And I assume a government like this does not include Salam. The bottom line is that our
direct budget support to the PA will probably come to an end, and many of our other activities with
the PA including the training program for the PASF are in jeopardy.

This will also have a bearing on the MEP, and that will also probably not be positive.

Several Palestinian sources (including the lead Fatah negotiator) confirmed that significant progress
toward a Hamas-Fatah reconciliation deal will be announced at 8pm local time (1pm edt) in Cairo today,
where lead Fatah negotiator Amami al-Ahmad and Hamas Politburo Deputy Musa Abu Marzouq were
meeting under GOE auspices. Unconfirmed press reports suggest the actual signing ceremony will take
place in Cairo within a week, with both Abu Mazen and Khaled Mish'al in attendance.

As we've reported previously in other channels, Abbas's initiative and subsequent mediation efforts
(particularly the Turkish channel) had reduced the differences between the two sides to essentially one
issue each: Fatah's demand for presidential elections (which Hamas had refused), and Hamas's insistence
on some role in the interim PLO leadership (which Fatah had so far resisted).

The major development today is that, according to Fatah's lead negotiator, Harnas ceded the point on
presidential electiont, and finally agreed to sign the 2009 GOE paper on the basis of side understandings
between the factions.

The basic elements of the deal, according to the lead Fatah negotiator, are as follows:

-To prepare for elections including presidential, legislative and PLO National Council elections within one
year from the signing;

-To create a government of independents that will lead the PA during the interim period before elections
occur, with no political program or mandate, selected with the mutual agreement ("tawafuq") of both
factions. Names were not discussed during today's session;

-To maintain separate Gaza and West Bank security apparatuses during the interim period before
elections occur; and

-Resolution of longstanding disagreements over the interim PLO leadership and the formation of an
electoral court via formulas borrowed from the November 2009 Egyptian paper and subsequent Fatah-
Hamas consultations in Damascus (we do not yet have the full details but we suspect the basic formula is
mutual agreement on names for these bodies).

Earlier today, before this news broke, I saw Abu Mazen, who had not yet received an update from his
negotiators in Cairo. He said his instructions to the delegation had not changed from previous rounds,
namely that Hamas had to accept his March 16 initiative without modification. He expressed some
confidence that the regional environment had turned against Hamas because of Syria, but added that "I
doubt that Hamas will bring anything new" to the meetings in Cairo today." He also attributed the
Egyptian invitation not to substantive developments but rather to Egypt's desire to preserve its mediation
role in the face of increased Turkish activism.

I spoke to Sa'eb Erekat later in the day, and he downplayed the story somewhat, based on what he had
overheard when the Fatah negotiator updated Abu Mazen late today. According to Erekat's version,
what was agreed to were minutes of the Cairo session which reportedly stated that the election
commission would be formed by Abbas, but that the interim government wasn't discussed. At this point, it
is possible that Erekat was either not fully informed on the details or deliberately downplaying this, or
actually believes that this is something short of a fully-baked deal.

I was sitting with PM Fayyad privately when the news broke. He was unaware (as he is not involved in the
on-again, off-again Fatah-Hamas talks), and his initial: reaction was relief, given the funding and political
difficulties he was facing.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah movement hammered an agreement with the
rival Hamas group on Wednesday on forming an interim government and fixing a date for general election,
Egyptian intelligence said.

   "The consultations resulted in full understandings over all points of discussions, including setting up an
interim agreement with specific tasks and to set a date for election," Egyptian intelligence said in a statement.
