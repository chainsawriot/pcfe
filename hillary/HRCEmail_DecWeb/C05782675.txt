Dear Cheryl & Jake,

The Secretary had a very good conversation with                         yesterday. He has agreed to gracefully step            B6
aside, and the Secretary has asked me to work on a few things to help facilitate a smooth transition. These are listed
below.
                                                                                                                          B5
                                                                                                                          B6




F nally, the Secretary feels very strongly that    be handled with great dignity in this process. He is understandably         B6 ,
d sappointed, but is too much of a professional not to do the right thing. He has given us a very graceful way forward,
and it would be great if the White House could assist us in this transition.

Best,
Kurt

Dr. Kurt M. Campbell
Assistant Secretary of State
East Asian & Pacific Affairs
