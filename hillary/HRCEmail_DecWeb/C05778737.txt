Subject: Libyan mission just announced plans to bring Libya before the Security Council

The Libyan mission to the UN has just held a press conference, hosted by the deputy perm rep and the legal adviser,
who said they spoke for the entire mission. They made a plea to the international community to save their country, and
said they (in representing Libya) were planning to take steps to bring the situation in Libya to the Security Council. They
sided with the protesters and opposition, called for ICC involvement, asked that a no fly zone be declared, and called on
neighbors not interfere in Libya (presumably referring to foreign mercenaries).
