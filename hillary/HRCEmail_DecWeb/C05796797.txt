Thank you for hosting Yousef and the GU group today.

 I'm very happy that they are willing to institutionalize two of your significant achievements. I think the institute can become
both a global research center of excellence (since we need the data and oral histories), as well as a public forum on
issues affecting much of the world and involving women, peace and security. They also have a campus in Doha and a far-
fiuna alobal network of institutional connections we will be able to tao



Jack is prepared to meet with you at your convenience after you leave State.

What follows is a note of thanks from the young woman who has been working on the project in preparation for its formal
launch for being able to meet you.

From:

Thank you for letting me come today, it meant a lot to me. I'm a nobody compared to the others but I have so much
respect and admiration for her. Her speech at Glown changed my life and to even have the chance to meet her was
incredible.

One more thing,
You will be getting papers to sunset the Women Business Leaders Council (which actually expires and would have to be
renewed). Attached to it are thank you letters to the Council members. Once this formality is completed, I will be in touch
with the members regarding next steps.


Thanks again for everything.
