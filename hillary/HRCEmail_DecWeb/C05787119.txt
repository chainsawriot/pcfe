Subject: Re: Progress on Sudan

Just to let everyone know the Abyei agreement is not yet a done deal. The NCP has sent it to Khartoum for approval.
Probably won't hear til tommorow. SK negotiations will also resume tomorrow after delwgation returns from SK. So
"progress toward agreements" is what we have. Even "encouraging progress" but not yet home free.

Subject: Progress on Sudan

Dear Madame Secretary:

There has been some progress on both the Abyei situation and Southern Kordofan. Your visit to Addis
facilitated a breakthrough in both negotiations. Follow-up calls from Susan Rice and myself today
helped push through the agreements. As we suspected, Prime Minister Meles provide the high level
leadership to get final compromises.

                                                                                                                           B1
