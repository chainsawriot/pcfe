Jake:
I am on vacation this week, but wanted S to have the attached paper                                                      B5
                                                         There are three attachments, which Stephen Townley can get to
you on the high side. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions.

She may want to read this paper *before* she turns to the annotated agenda for tomw's meeting. As you will see, the
specific recommendations we suggest to her on the particular issues                             are best understood as
part of a broader recommendation we have about adopting an overall strategy to reclaim the initiative on GTMO
closure.
