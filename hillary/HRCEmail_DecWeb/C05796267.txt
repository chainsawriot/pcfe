NYT has agreed not to identify the affiliation of the former Seals or of the annex. However, because of the thrust of the
story as the loss of intel collection capability at a critical juncture, it will refer to the Agency's presence and activities--for
which he had good info, sadly.

Thanks, Tommy. I am just not optimistic about this at all. NYT has an obligation to its readers, you know. But we should
all remember that if this goeS forward we are in a no comment/no confirmation mode. We will let you know the
outcome.

I heard from Helene Cooper today. I told her we have no comment but think they should absolutely not report
this

Forgot to add in: intervention with Eric last night and the Bureau Chief an hour or so ago did not bring closure. We've said, off the
record, that IDing the officers and the facility will bring risk to anyone working in any annex around the world. And that inserting our
organization into the mix when the security situation at so many embassies is tenuous at best would be inflammatory. The next call is
planned for 5pm.

Just heard from NYT           4hat Eric Schmidt is working on a piece abt the Annex, and loss of platform. And he plans to print what it
was. I'm told "upper levels" are talking to each other. Flagging for this crew to make sure it's true.
