Hi Jake-

We submitted a Distinguished Honor award nomination for                            with the hope of getting this through the
committee so that, if approved, S could present it to       before she departs. I have followed up with the S/ES and HR
folks a few times but nothing I can do is prying this lose. With S's time now running so short, is there anything you may
be able to do to help us out on this? We suddenly realized when we did our last awards ceremony with
has never been properly recognized for everything he has done for                                               since 2009,
and I know it would mean a tremendous amount to him given how much he respects the Secretary.

Let me know what you think. I'm happy to follow-up with whomever I should.
Thanks!
Kate

Hi Debbie-

I just wanted to follow up on this Distinguished Honor award nomination for                   I know that the award
committee only meets once every few months. I'm wondering if there is any way to do this outside of the normal
awards cycle. We are trying to arrange for an                with the Secretary as part of
farewell. It looks like the S schedulers are looking at potentially doing this next Monday or Wednesday. If so, it would be
really wonderful if S could present this award to                                                               last day is
Friday, but we will bring him back for this photo).

Is there anything we can do to rush this? Thanks in advance for your help- I really appreciate it.

 Kate
