Thank you for approving this! I'm excited to try to do something good over there.

Also, a deeper and more heartfelt thanks for making this such a great place to work. My two hats more often put me in
front of Jake, so he's heard me say this and maybe you haven't: I actually can't believe how smoothly this place has run
over the years that I've been here. And I attribute it largely to the fact that a handful of people—starting with S. you,
Jake, Huma, PIR, D's (well, Jim's a case unto himself)—were all such consummate team players, good to each other and
good to all of us. Together you set the tone for the entire seventh floor and building. It's something I'm very sad to see
end (hopefully to be reconstituted down the road). And it's something—alongside all the other things people will
recognize you for—to be extremely proud of.

If I can ever be of help, I'm not hard to find.

Dan
