â€¢The planned public event has taken place in Tripoli and CNN, FOX, Al Arabiya, Radio Sawa and others were there to
 cover the first aircraft. Gene also did one-on-one interviews with CNN and FOX.

@Statedept and our regional media hubs have sent tweets to highlight + draw attention. We will get video and push
that out as well. We are also poised with NEA and PA press officers to handle media in Boston upon arrival there.

We'll be tracking press coverage.
