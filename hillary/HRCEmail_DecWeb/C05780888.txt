Only 2 quick issues to flag, both related to OSCE.

First, the Liths guided OSCE's selection of a new SecGen, Italian diplomat Lamberto Zannier. He starts tomorrow. Was
not easy for them as Chairman or for organization and if there is a second to flag would be nice grace note.

Second, head of OSCE mission in Bosnia is turning over this summer. Traditionally an American position and we have put
forward strong candidate. Russians are pushing for a Russian to take position -- given uncertainties with EU over OHR in
Bosnia, need to keep strong US presence as head of 500 plus person OSCE mission. Liths agree but looking to hear from
us -- I can raise with FM on margins if S cannot but if she has chance with him would be good.
Thanks!

PS: incredibly lovely evening -- our boss is amazing.
