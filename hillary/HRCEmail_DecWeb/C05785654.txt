Subject: RE:

Madame Secretary,

I have not worked on anything since I arrived here where the gap between the value of what we are doing and the
public perception of it is more out of sync.
                                  we have been on the receiving end of a series of negative stories about this program
and are now fighting to retain our funding on the Hill



In fact on the merits, since I arrived in September 2009, I've watched the program grow from just two grants awarded in
the last days of the Bush Administration that had languished without oversight for almost a year to a thriving group of
grantees and sub- grantees totaling $22 million. We have an excellent team in place and by the end of this month, we
will make another round of grants totaling about $28 million to a number of excellent organizations.



governments cracking down on their own people aren't just putting up firewalls, they're torturing people for their
passwords, infecting their computers with viruses, hacking their email accounts, and taking down their websites. Your
Internet Freedom speeches make clear that this issue is about defending people in their use of the open, content-
neutral Internet to tell their own stories.

Our Internet freedom program is supporting that objective, and while the projects are still very young, we're already
seeing results. In the last 18 months, we've supported a dozen different circumvention technologies, trained 5,000 of
the most high-risk activists, run cyber self-defense campaigns to raise awareness about how to keep safe when using
online tools in hostile environments, started funding brand new technology to secure mobile phones, and supported
cutting edge research on the emerging threats activists are facing.

Ironically, other governments and big foundations increasingly are looking to our program as the best-in-class model of
how to support activists and journalists in hostile Internet environments. I'm confident that this program will be part of
your legacy,

                                                                                                            We issued $6.5
million in grants last summer, on top of the $15 million that we inherited from the last Administration. In December, we
issued a solicitation for a further $30 million together with NEA. Normal grants processing takes 6 - 9 months (and
sometimes longer) to issue a solicitation, give people time to submit applications, evaluate them, notify Congress, and
then finalize grant agreements with successful organizations. Because Internet freedom is so urgent, we've moved that
timeline up--the Internet freedom team is evaluating proposals today and will notify Congress by the end of the month,
two months ahead of the most optimistic timelines for a normal grants.process. This is a new policy area, and the
Department didn't have a foreign policy strategy for Internet freedom until DRL led a collaborative process to develop a
strategy with the buy-in of actors around the Department and USAID that you signed in November. In short, we took
time to develop a strong program that will protect the safety and privacy of digital activists,




You're right that perception rules, and if anything, the place where we've fallen short is in public messaging around the
Internet freedom program. We're being beaten by a false narrative that we're slow, we don't care, and we don't have
capacity. This is far from the truth, and we're working full steam ahead to change the narrative. We've gotten some
small media coverage in the last two weeks and are working on a few bigger stories. Judith has been incredibly
supportive, and DRL's enhanced communications capacity will be hugely helpful in the coming weeks. I know a $15
million transfer seems like small potatoes, but I strongly believe that transferring this money will confuse the issue of
Internet freedom and undermine the Department's credibility on a defense of an open, content-neutral Internet. This
isn't about just enabling people to access blocked content--this is about a comprehensive program that keeps people out
of jail, on the streets, on blogs, in newspapers, telling their own stories.

Having been in DC's evidence-free zone longer than I care to recall, I do know that perception trumps facts every time so
we are in a deficit position from which to challenge these assertions.

I'm sorry that you keep having to deal with this. I'm confident that we are right on substance, that our programs are and
will continue to be effective at supporting people on the ground, saving them from real danger, giving them safe access.
We are about to distribute what will be the most competitive, cutting edge programming done for
democracy/development in the USG.

Dan

I am, as you might guess, concerned and surprised
              the facts she cites don't make us look good. What's the bottom line on what we've actually done?
