Cheryl:
I saw you from a distance at Julissa's very moving swearing in today but by the time I walked in your direction, the
ceremony was over and you had already left. I did, however, want to give you an update on my confirmation saga.

Last week Senator Murkowski (R-Alaska) spoke to White House contacts and indicated she was considering changing her
vote on my confirmation. She has asked to meet me, and an appointment is being sought. Additionally, I had a very
good conversation with Senator Menendez, who is now very engaged and is in the process of reconfirming Senator
Rubio's position as a "Yes" on my vote. Further, Menendez indicated he will be approaching a couple of Republicans
asking them to support me.

The objective is to obtain a total of 10 Republican votes. If we can persuade Senator Murkowski, and Senator Rubio
reconfirms his positive intent, we believe we have a total of 8 votes.

I did talk to Maria about these developments, but also wanted to share with you this important progress!

Thanks,
Mari Carmen
