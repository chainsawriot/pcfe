Sorry I missed your call earlier. Just a few quick updates on a fairly quiet day.

    1. You will have heard from Dave that we are stuck with the closure of the PLO office if they obtain membership in
       another agency, but got nowhere on the waiver.

    2.

                     But this is viewed as a positive sign. Meanwhile, on Friday, Secretary Panetta signed Mod 9 of
         ExOrd 1003 Victor, withdrawing the extant Rules of Engagement for US Forces - Iraq. This action provides the
         legal mechanism for ending all Iraq War authorities.

    3. The Stanekzai-Karzai meeting today was cancelled; it's potentially on for tomorrow.

    4. I met with                                          who told me that there is extensive debate on how to
       approach the China econ issue, which I can give you more color on tomorrow.

    5. Jeff is talking to ABZ tomorrow on the Gulf Security Forum, so we'll have more information before your lunch
       Tuesday on where things are and where they are headed.

    6.
