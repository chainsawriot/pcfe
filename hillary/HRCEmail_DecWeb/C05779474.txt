Ashton and Frattini each called me this afternoon in Tunis. Highlights:

Both on same general wave length on Egypt and Tunisia, consistent with impressions I sent back to S last night from
Cairo.

                                                                                                                      B1
                                                                                                                      1.4(B)
                                                                                                                      1.4(D)

Both would welcome call from S, and are eager to cooperate.
