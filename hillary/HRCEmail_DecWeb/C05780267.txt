Hi guys, Read-out of today's meeting on Syria UNSCR below. (I also talked to Curtis by phone and got more detail.)

                                                                                                                            1.4(D)

We'll know a bit more about vote counts after tomorrow's meeting with the Brazilians and South Africans, but will have
to decide at some point after that.

Joe
