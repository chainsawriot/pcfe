You were right -- convention entered into force without us signing.

Background:

Delegates from 107 nations agreed to the final draft of the treaty at the end of a ten-day meeting held in May 2008 in
Dublin, Ireland.[18] Its text was formally adopted on 30 May 2008 by 107 nations,[19] including 7 of the. 14 countries
that have used cluster bombs and 17 of the 34 countries that have produced them.[20]

The treaty was opposed by a number of countries that produce or stockpile significant quantities of cluster munitions,
including China, Russia, the United States, India, Israel, Pakistan and Brazil.[12] The U.S. has acknowledged huminitarian
concerns about the use of cluster munitions, but insisted that the proper venue for a discussion of cluster munitions was
the forum attached to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, which includes all major military powers.[21]
The U.S. has further stated that the development and introduction of "smart" cluster munitions, where each
submunition contains its own targeting and guidance system as well as an auto-self-destruct mechanism, means that the
problematic munitions are being moved away from in any case.[12] ln•2006, Barack Obama voted to support a legislative
measure to limit use of the bombs, while his general election opponent John McCain and his primary opponent Hillary
Clinton (now U.S. Secretary of State) both voted against it.[22]

The treaty allows certain types of weapons with submunitions that do not have the indiscriminate area effects or pose
the same unexploded ordnance risks as the prohibited weapons. These must contain no more than nine submunitions,
and no submunition may weigh more than 4 kilograms (8.8 lb). Each submunition must have the capability to detect and
engage a single target object and contain electronic self-destruct and self-deactivation devices.[8] Weapons containing
submunitions which each weigh at least 20 kg (44 lb) are also excluded.[9] Australia, which supports the treaty, stated
that the convention does not prohibit the SivlArt 155 artillery shell that it has bought, which releases two self-guided
self-destructing submunitions.[8]

In response to U.S. lobbying, and also concerns raised by diplomats from Australia, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom
and others, the treaty includes a provision allowing signatory nations to cooperate militarily with non-signatory nations.
This provision is designed to provide legal protections to the military personnel of signatory nations engaged in military
operations with the U.S. or other non-signatory nations that might use cluster munitions.[23]

Prior to the Dublin meeting, the United Kingdom was thought to be one of a group of nations in a pivotal role whereby
their cooperation could make or break the treaty: In a drarnatic[peacock term] turn of events shortly before the end of
the conference, Prime Minister Gordon Brown declared that the U.K. would withdraw all of its cluster bombs from
service..[24] This was done despite intense behind-the-scenes lobbying by the U.S. and objections by British government
personnel who saw utility in the weapons.

The CCM was opened for signature at a ceremony at Oslo City Hall on
3-4 December 2008. By the end of the ceremony, 94 states had signed the treaty, including four (Ireland, the Holy See,
Sierra Leone and
Norway) which had also submitted their instruments of ratification.
Signatories included 21 of the 27 member-states of the European Union and 18 of the 26 countries in NATO. Among the
signatories were several states affected by cluster munitions, including Laos and Lebanon.

In November 2008, ahead of the signing Conference in Oslo, the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on all
European Union governments to sign and ratify the Convention, as several EU countries had not yet declared their
intention to do so.[25] Finland had declared it would not sign.[26] [edit] Entry into force

According to article 17 of the treaty, the convention entered into force "on the first day of the sixth month after the
month in which the thirtieth instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession has been deposited"[3]. Since
the thirtieth ratification was deposited during February 2010, the convention entered into force on 1 August 2010; by
that point, 38 nations had ratified the treaty.

As the convention entered into force, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon spoke of "not only the world's collective
revulsion at these abhorrent weapons, but also the power of collaboration among governments, civil society and the
United Nations to change attitudes and policies on a threat faced by all humankind".[27] A spokesman for the
International Committee of the Red Cross said "These weapons are a relic of the Cold War. They are a legacy that has to
be eliminated because they increasingly won't work".[28] Nobel peace prize winner Jody Williams called the convention
"the most important disarmament and humanitarian convention in over a decade".[28J

Anti-cluster munitions campaigners praised the rapid progress made in the adoption of the convention, and expressed
hope that even non-signatories — such as the US, China and Russia — would be discouraged from using the weapons by
the entry into force of the convention.[29] As one of the countries that did not ratify the treaty, the United States said
that cluster bombs are a legal form of weapon, and that they had a "cleat military utility in combat." It also said that
compared to other types of weapons, cluster bombs are less harmful to civilians
