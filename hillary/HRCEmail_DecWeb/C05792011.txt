Met this afternoon separately with FS Hague and Lady Ashton. Also had long phone conversation with Peter Ricketts. A
few highlights:

Hague was on identical wave length on Libya. Brits taking domestic heat over difficulties in extracting citizens, Cameron's
absence in Gulf, etc. Hague had just finished crisis mtg within FCO, and also working on op to get oil workers in south
out.

Hague confident that EU measures will be finalized in next few days. Had just talked to Lavrov, who was constructive on
UNSCR, supportive of vote on Monday and raising relatively minor textual concerns. Lay did not object to ICC reference.
Hague trying to reach S Af FM later today.

Hague and Ricketts agreed that UN ought to have central organizing role on post-Qadhafi efforts in Libya. Want to
coordinate closely with us.

On wider regional issues, Hague and Ricketts positive on prospects for Tunisia and Egypt. They're only just beginning to
think about broader strategy, but Ricketts agreed that changes unfolding across region are as big challenge for Trans-
Atlantic partnership as end of Cold War was 20 yrs ago. Requires big ideas on support for pol institution building,
economic modernization (esp trade liberalization), and peace process.

Ricketts said Cameron had spoken with Merkel this am, before Merkel's planned call to President. Merkel will push hard
for bolder steps on peace process. Ricketts said Merkel and Sarkozy will tag team President on this; Cameron agrees
with them in substance, but will be more careful about not jamming President.

Hague worried about Yemen (he plans to co-chair Friends of Yemen mtg in Riyadh next month). Also concerned about
Jordan. Looks forward to seeing S on Monday in Geneva.

Ashton quite focused. Agrees broadly on Libya, working hard to nail down EU measures. On wider region, particularly
interested in Tunisia ("EU must take lead there"), wants to work with us on Egypt.

Also beginning to think about bigger strategic picture, along same lines as Ricketts and Hague. Esp focused on trade
initiative, given her recent experience as EU Trade Commissioner.

Ashton had also talked to Lavrov re Libya UNSCR, and found him generally cooperative. Ashton agrees that UN must take
lead on post-Q Libya.

She is seeing Salehi in Geneva. Ashton may also try to call S before Monday, just to touch bases.

Flying to Rabat tonight.

Bill
