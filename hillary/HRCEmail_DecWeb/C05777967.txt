I've returned to State. POTUS was set to speak with Mubarak a short while ago. The speech is revised a fair amount to
take account of the VP's and your concerns. I talked to Bill about the private envoy idea and discussed with the team
over there before I left.



                                         I think you can wait til Monday's meeting.
