tEUR-SE, NSS Godfrey, Treiber, other Ankara, Adana, Istanbul officers:

Recommend a public statement of condolences/concern from SecState +/or WH would be entirely appropriate,
obviously deferring to GoT authorities as to details of the disaster.

Laird Treiber is our Incident Manager, and he is sending in a comprehensive report as I write this, following episodic
email reporting through various channels incl DS and to Ops Ctr.

We have been in touch w/ MFA, Red Crescent, PM's National Disaster Response Directorate, Chief of TNP, local official +
political contacts in Van, to offer condolences and assistance.

We had issued public statement offering condolences and assistance, in Turkish media now.

Scope of disaster not clear; following typical pattern of escalating confirmations of killed/injured + properties destroyed,
but these lagging far behind media speculation.

No known AmCit victims; consulate Adana attempting contact w/ (3) three known American families in the area.

Believe (but still confirming) all COM personnel OK; have confirmed that none were to be in the affected area, far from
US dip/consular/mil installations.

US Coniul had joined US Armenian Archbishop Barsamian + his VIP AmCit del @ reconsecration of newly restored
church in Diyarbakir, and dissuaded Archbishop + party from plans to proceed to Van. (I had previously cancelled my
own plans to participate w/ US Embassy delegation in Archbishop's planned prayer ceremony @ Akhtemar Church in
Van, due to tensions over PKK attacks in region this past week.)

Adding Embassy to this email. I would initially just offer condolences and general willingness to help and then let's see
what specifics they and our teams say are needed. I have left message to that effect with Tan.

Phil,
Will do. Would you just like me to offer condolences and see what we can do to help or anything more specific? Can also

Subject: Response to Turkish Earthquake

You will have seen that there was a very serious earthquake near Van in eastern Turkey this morning, with recent
estimates putting it at 7.3 on the Richter scale, and initial reports suggest there are hundreds of fatalities. Embassy
Ankara has convened an Emergency Action Committee and formed a command post to monitor the situation and
coordinate any USG response. The Embassy has been in touch with the Turks to determine whether they are seeking
outside assistance, and OFDA has put the Fairfax and Miami/Dade County search and rescue teams on standby for
possible deployment to assist in recovery efforts. Ops Center will update through the day as required.
