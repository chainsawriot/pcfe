        same location, only one may choose "with family" status for
        travel and allowance purposes. Failure to advise HR/EX of
        this election will delay issuance of travel orders.

       Preparing to leave for your new assignment? For your

       Transportation Lite - a web-based tool that allows you to
       initiate your move request via the Department's Intranet.
       Transportation Lite gives you the ability to schedule your
       move from the convenience of your desktop. Come and go as
       you wish. Transportation Lite lets you pick up where you
       left off because it saves your data as you work. Your move
       request is submitted electronically to a Transportation
       Counselor and/or participating Post GSO, and reduces the
       need for in-person counseling. Easy to use, Transportation
       Lite walks you step-by-step through the process.
       Transportation Lite provides you quick access to the
       information you need to know for a smoother move, and it
       provides links to important documents and contacts for many
       of the questions you may have. For instructions on how to
       get started, please contact us at
       TransportationQuery@state.gov.

             REPORTING FOR DUTY. As soon as you begin work in your new
             domestic office or organization, you must report the date
             of your arrival. This can now be done through the
             electronic DS-1707 Form accessed through HR Online. (If you
             do not have an HR Online account, you can easily create one
             by selecting the 'Create your HR Online account' in the box
             on the right hand side of the HR Online main menu.) This
             date is important because it is the effective date of your
             new assignment. After the Employee Services Center (ESC)
             has approved the DS-1707 form, the arrival date will be
             used to process a personnel action changing your location
             to your new position. It is this personnel action which
             causes your new assignment to appear on your Employee
             Profile and begin locality pay, if you have just arrived
             for a domestic assignment. Employees who are being assigned
             from overseas to any U.S. location should check in with the
             Employee Services Center (ESC) (formerly Foreign Service
             Lounge) to update their Employee Locator Record and
             Emergency Contact information. The ESC counselors can also
             assist you in completing your DS-1707 and can be reached at
             202-647-3432. Failure to complete this form on a timely
             basis may delay the commencement of locality pay.

             D. QUARTERS:
             Not applicable.

             E. MED CLEARANCE-FINANCIAL OBLIGATION
             In accordance with 16 FAM 211.1, it is each employee's
             responsibility to ensure that he or she and eligible family
             members obtain a valid medical clearance. Failure to
             obtain a valid medical clearance for yourself and all
             eligible family members traveling with you prior to
             traveling to post may result in your having a significant
             financial obligation to the Department of State. Failure
             to comply with this requirement may also result in the
             employee not receiving benefits under States Medical
             Program and as such the employee may be held responsible
             for medical travel and/or related expenses associated with
             such persons.

             F. MEDICAL CLEARANCE
             You are reminded to obtain all medical clearances as set
             forth in 16 FAM 211.1. Employees are required to obtain a
             medical clearance at the end of the tour of duty or at the
             time of home leave, whichever period is shorter. Home
             leave may take place at the end of a tour or mid-tour. For
             example, in the case of a four-year tour at an R&R post,
             the medical clearance is due at the time of the mid-tour
             home leave at the end of the first two-year period, i.e., 2
             years (1R&R)/HLRT (mid-tour home leave)/2 years (1 R&R).
             This would mean that the medical clearances for both you
             and your eligible family members would need to be updated
             just before or during the mid-tour home leave point, and
             then again towards the end of the second two-year period of
             the TOD. You may contact your health unit at post or M/MED
             at medclearances@state.gov to confirm that you and/or your
             family do have valid medical clearances. Employees who are
             assigned to long-term language training and all family
             members who will accompany them overseas must have a
             current medical clearance before language training begins.

             G. PROPOSED ITINERARY/FROM OVERSEAS
             To initiate transfer orders, you must submit a Proposed
             Itinerary (TMTWO) through My Itinerary in HROnline. On a

        post-to-post transfer, consultations in Washington or
        elsewhere may be authorized before or after your home leave
        in accordance with direct travel requirements.
        (Consultations are NOT authorized when assigned to a
        domestic assignment.) A proposed itinerary is also
        required for SMA and advance travel of EFMs. The
        requirement to submit a proposed itinerary applies to all
        employees departing from assignments abroad, transferring
        on permanent change of station (PCS) travel orders,
        including Chiefs of Mission. Travel orders generally are
        issued approximately sixty to ninety days before your
        official ETD, UNLESS travel, timing, or training
        requirements remain unresolved.

        H. TRAVEL TIMING
        The timing of departure from post can affect eligibility
        for home leave and, if applicable, R&R travel and Service
        Need Differential (SND). To avoid having to repay the
        costs of R&R travel, YOU MUST COMPLETE YOUR FULL TOUR OF
        DUTY (departing anytime during the month of your TED)
        unless a waiver has been authorized by HR/CDA. See 3 FAM
        3727.1 http://arpsdir.a.state.gov/fam/03fam/03fam3720.html
        for details on grounds and procedures for R&R repayment
        waivers. To be eligible for home leave, you may not depart
        post until completing a minimum of eighteen (18) months, to
        the day, of continuous service abroad (twelve [12] months
        of continuous service abroad for designated posts). To
        avoid having to repay the SND you received during this
        assignment, you must complete your full tour of duty,
        unless a waiver has been authorized by HR/CDA. In all but
        the most compelling cases or reassignment to the
        Departnnent?s highest priority posts, employees will be
        required to repay all SND allowance if they end their SND
        assignment early.

        I.DEBRIEFING
        You are reminded to contact the RSO to schedule a
        debriefing prior to departure.

        J. DIVERSITY
        In accordance with the Palmer and Thomas Consent Decrees,
        FS employees in supervisory roles are directed to take the
        "EEO/Diversity Awareness for Managers and Supervisor"
        course or a course that incorporates a Diversity Awareness
        module at the time of their transfer. Contact your CDO for
        registration.

        K. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
        Public Financial Disclosure Report requirement for
        stretches and seniors: (1) Employees grade 01 and below
        who are assigned (stretched) into senior (OC and MC)
        positions and SFS serving at grade or in a down position
        must file a Public Financial Disclosure Report (SF-278)
        within 30 days of the effective date of their arrival in
        their assignment. Extensions must be requested prior to
        the due date of any submission to avoid a late fee
        assessment. Mandatory assessment of the $200 late filing
        fee is strictly enforced. "Annual" or "incumbent" SF-278s
        are required by May 15 each year and a "termination" SF-278
        is required within 30 days of departure from the senior
        position. (2) Seniors (0C and above as well as
        Presidential appointees) who separate from the Service must
        file a "termination" SF-278 within 30 days of the effective
        date of their termination. Posts and Bureaus maintain a
