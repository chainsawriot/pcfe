Dear Judith,

                 On branding, USAID began implementing the new branding policy as soon as the decision was
made in December. I have attached a few photos I received from USAID. All of USAID's partners have been
informed of the branding requirement. The total transition is paced with the printing of new materials. There
are also issues of size and style of the brand, e.g. the flag, as USAID and its partners work out the
aesthetics. What we don't have yet is the logo placed on things, like bridges, bags of food, etc. That branding
is still being implemented, and somewhat limited by which projects actually have a thing to put the logo on.


       Regards. Walter.

Walter:

Hope all is well in Islamabad. Corley is incredibly excited about the possibility of going out there to help you guys. Hope
it all works out. If it does, you will have to tell the Ambassador that he owes me big time since I will have given him 3 of
my top people!!!

Just wanted to check with you to see if the Ambassador has begun to implement the new approach towards branding
that we discussed last year. If so I'd like to know how it is going so I can assess if it provides a good model for other
parts of the world and other programs.
