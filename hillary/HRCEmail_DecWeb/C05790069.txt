Emb observer reports that police have cleared Bolotnaya, in some cases pretty roughly. Lots of scuffles and arrests.
Dozens more since last report.

According to Emb observer, the crowd is much more aggressive as well. As police boats come by on the canal, crowd is
pelting them with bottles. Crowd is also cheering as protesters rip off helmets of police and toss them in river.

Around 5,000 left in some places around the sq, as many of rest were forced out to adjoining streets. Emboff observed
protesters giving instructions to crowd to depart and attempt to regroup at Manezh sq (other side of Kremlin).

WashPost correspondent told our press officer that crowd was slightly less than winter, but less playful. Also reported
more police brutality, as if almost to make a point to, protesters.

Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov tweeted that the police acted very "softly", and he wished they would have been
harsher.

Sorry, as I hit send, our emb observer called in with the following and additional info came in on media:

Number of protesters has grown significantly, maybe up to 50,000 in comparison with previous demonstrations.
Udaltsov says 100,000.

There appears to be standoff with police, as they are not letting people onto Bolotnaya, causing tens of thousands to
accumulate on bridge leading to square.

Subject: Protest in Moscow, Russia Update 1

Between 10-20,000 protesters (police estimate around 8,000, independent media 20,000) turned out for the "million-
man march" in Moscow today.

The crowd, made up of a variety of groups including Left Front, Solidarity, anarchists, and a few nationalists, among
others, is now filing into Bolotnaya square now, sight of previous demonstrations. Protesters are demonstrating against
what they perceive to be the illegitimate election of Putin and tomorrow's inauguration. Numbers may increase at
Bolotnaya.

-Emb observers report no confrontations as of now, but there is a heavy police presence at Bolotnaya and around the
Kremlin and Manezh sq, where some of the protesters have promised to go after Bolotnaya. Media reports several
detentions of protesters carrying tents.

-opposition leaders Udaltsov, Navalny, Nemtsov, and Yashin have called for a "sit-in", sitting along with several hundred,
threatening not to leave.
 RESPONSE

-Simultaneously, authorities have organized a pro-Kremlin rally of the All-Russia Popular Front. Organizers promise up to
50,000. Some reports that participants may be being bussed in by state enterprises. The Patriarch appeared appealing
to supporters to not believe "those who promise something new, which no one knows."

-Law enforcement authorities have impeded hundreds of protesters in the region attempting to come to Moscow to
participate in the opposition protest. For example, 5 chartered buses were stopped leaving Petersburg, a train station
was evacuated in Ufa, and buses were stopped coming from Astrakhan.

-over a dozen metro stations have been closed downtown.

-independent media internet sites, such as Echo Moscow, Dozhd tv, and kommersant have come under DDOS attack.

-draft authorities are mounting a major operation to examine all young people detained today to see if they should be
conscripted for military service. Public statements, probably meant to intimidate young people, have focused on the fact
that these draft authorities are working to fill posts far from Moscow.
