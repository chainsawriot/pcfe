                                                                               APR 2 1 2010

           The Honorable Kent Conrad
           Chairman
           Committee on the Budget .
           United States Senate
           Washington, DC 20510

           Dear Mr. Chairman:

                  I am writing to express my strong support for full funding of the President's FY 2011
           foreign affairs budget request (the 150 account) which, along with defense, is a critical
           component of an integrated and effective national security program.

                   I understand this year presents a challenging budget environment, with competing
           domestic and international pressures. However, I strongly believe a robust civilian foreign
           affairs capability, coupled with a strong defense capability, is essential to preserving U.S.
           national security interests around the world.

                   State and USAID partners are critical to success in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq. Our
           military and civilian missions are integrated, and we depend upon our civilian counterparts to
           help stabilize and rebuild after the fight. As U.S. forces transition out of vow zones, the U.S.
           government needs our civilian agencies to be able to assume critical functions. This allows u.s,
           for example, to draw down US. forces in Iraq responsibly while ensuring hard-fought gains are
           secured. Cuts to the 150 account will almost certainly impact our efforts in these critical
           frontline states.

                   In other parts of the world, the work performed by diplomatic and development
           professionals helps build the foundation for more stable, democratic and prosperous societies.
           These are places where the potential for conflict can be minimized, if not completely avoided, by
           State and USAID programs â€” thereby lowering the likely need for deployment of U.S. military
           assets.

                   In formulating his request for FY 2011, the President carefully considered funding needs
           for the budget accounts for both foreign affairs and national defense, taking into account overall;
           national security requirements as well as economic conditions. I believe that full funding of
           these two budget accounts is necessary for our national security and for ensuring our continued
           leadership in the world. I hope you will take this into account when acting upon the President's
           FY 2011 budget request.

                                                                rely,



           cc:
           The Honorable Judd Gregg
           Ranking Member
