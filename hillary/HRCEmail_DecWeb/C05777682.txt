Subject: Bahrain update 2/17 0700L

Charge Stephanie Williams just called me from Manama. She reports that as of 0700L:

Datt reports that Bahraini tanks have left Bahraini military base in southern part of island, apparently headed towards
capital. Unclear what they intend to do.

Unconfirmed reports are that there are now 4 dead. Post can not verify number. Crowds are gathering at hospital.

She has attempted to contact FM urgently (and has reached his staff) but he has not returned her call. Attempts to reach
Min Interior and Mukhabarat have also been unsuccessful. She suspects that they are avoiding her. Uk amb hasn't been
able to talk to any senior officials since an earlier call last nite with Min Interior.

Min Interior told UK amb last nite (Bahrain time) that GOB wd deal with protestors in framework of Bahraini law.
Apparently, they are using pretext of disruption of traffic as reason to clear Pearl square. Clearly, she commented, GOB
red lines seemed to have been crossed.

Stephanie assumes that violence will increase during day; Shia community and protesters unlikely to take govt action
without reaction.

in consultation with Emb staff and appropriate school and military officials she decided:

- embassy personnel wd be told not to report to work;
- am school wd close for day;
- Navcent base put on heightened alert and closed.

Full EAC is meeting to take additional actions this morning and ensure that broader am community is informed in
accordance with no double standard rule. Warden message is being drafted for approval, although slow internet (GoB
action?) is impeding communication significantly.

 UK embassy is taking similar steps.

Stephanie will provide update either by email or phone by 0600 tomorrow.
