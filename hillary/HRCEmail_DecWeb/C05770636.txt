     The Honorable Nancy Pelosi
     Speaker of the House of Representatives
     United States House of Representatives
     Washington, D.C. 20515

     Dear Madam Speaker,

           As the Congress moves to finalize the budget for FY 2011, I want to offer
     my strong support for fully funding the Department of Defense and related
     agencies. I also want to reinforce the views expressed in Secretary Gates' letter
     of April 21 and Secretary Clinton's letter of April 20 (copies attached) to
     Senator Kent Conrad, requesting full funding of the Department of State and
     USAID. We are living in times that require an integrated national security
     program with budgets that fund the full spectrum of national security efforts,
     including vitally important pre-conflict and post-conflict civilian stabilization
     programs.

            Diplomatic programs are critical to our long-term security. I have been
     on record many times since 2005 expressing my views of the importance of
     fully funding our diplomatic efforts. As Chief of Naval Operations, I said that I
     would hand over part of my budget to the State Department, "in a heartbeat,
     assuming it was spent in the right place." Diplomatic efforts should always
     lead and shape our international relationships, and .I believe that our foreign
     policy is still too dominated by our military. The diplomatic and developmental
     capabilities of the United States have a direct bearing on our ability to shape
     threats and reduce the need for military action. It is my firm belief that
     diplomatic programs as part of a coordinated strategy will save, money by
     reducing the likelihood of active military conflict involving U.S. forces.

            I am told that the Senate Budget Committee reduced the international
     affairs budget by $4 billion, and I respect and appreciate the tough choices the
     committee had to make. I would ask that as you finalize the spending outlines
     for FY 2011, you underscore the importance of our civilian efforts to the work
     of the Defense Department, and ultimately, to our Nation's security. Because
     of the increasingly integrated nature of our operations, a $4 billion decrement
     in State and USAID budgets will have a negative impact in ongoing U.S.
     military efforts, leading to higher costs through missed diplomatic and
     developmental needs and opportunities. A fully-integrated foreign policy
     requires a fully-resourced approach. Our troops, Foreign Service officers and
     development experts work side-by-side in unprecedented and ever-increasing
     cooperation as they execute our strategic programs. We need to continue to

     grow the important capabilities that are unique to our non-military assets,
     ensuring they have the resources to enhance our security and advance our
     national interests, in both ongoing conflicts as well as in preventative efforts.

           As always, I appreciate your strong support of our men and women in
     uniform, and appreciate your considering my perspective as you finalize the FY
     2011 budget.                     ••      •
