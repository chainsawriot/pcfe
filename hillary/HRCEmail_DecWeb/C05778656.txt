I agree with a statement we can informally push out to our press corps. The one thing I'm nervous about in Jake's frame
is that it invites comparisons between what he said and what we think. I'm not sure we want to travel down that road.
An alternative.

We have great respect for Frank and we were deeply appreciative of his willingness to travel to Egypt last week. He has
not continued in any capacity following the trip. The views he expressed today are his own. He did not coordinate his
comments with the U.S. government.

Let's put out a statement:

Frank Wisner is a private citizen and he does not speak for the USG. The views he expressed today are his alone and in
some cases self-evidently at odds with stated USG positions. We have great respect for Frank and we were deeply
appreciative of his willingness to travel to Egypt last week. He has not continued in any capacity following the trip or
coordinated his comments with the USG.

I don't know what we gain by getting hamstrung by our relationship with Wisner. Try this:

As we've said, it is important that there be serious and broad-based discussions among government and opposition
leaders to move the transition forward and deliver results that meet the aspirations of the Egyptian people. There are a
wide range of views on how to best accomplish this, but Egypt's future will be determined by the Egyptian people.

The hubs didn't think my first stab would fly. How about this one?

As a gov't we recognize that there are many ways for this to go. We believe the most constructive thing the US can do is
to stay out of an Egyptian decision. Where individuals have their own opinions, they voice them. But that is not the
position of the USG.

 Subject: Re: Gamal

 My understanding is that Gamal resigned from the party completely, Hosni resigned as head of the party.

 Another fyi- the Wikileaks cables on Egypt are going viral. Key quotes:

 - Egypt's military is in decline
 - General Tantawi is an incompetent defense mnisyer running the mil into the ground. Mubarak's poodle
