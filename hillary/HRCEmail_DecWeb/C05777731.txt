Just seeing this from Alon. Interesting take on Berger and Hadley. Might be worth a separate call to Berger.

Second hand info: To my surprise, they're not going to be as supportive of putting out a plan, despite their
long-standing positions, public statements, and the hype they've generated.                       they sense   B5
that the Admin doesn't have an appetite for that and to "be relevant" are going to recommend a softer
approach, just offering territory and maybe something on security.

Wanted you to be aware of that
