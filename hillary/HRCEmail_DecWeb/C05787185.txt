Laura--

My phone service is sketchy at best. So, rather than play phone tag w you, let me explain what I am asking. And, thank
you, in advance, for accepting!

I have created a new federal advisory committee at the State Department to provide me with informed advice on a
broad range of U.S. foreign policy issues.

The committee will be comprised of approximately twenty-five private American citizens who have distinguished
backgrounds in U.S. diplomacy, development and national security affairs. The membership will be bi-partisan and
diverse. We have named this committee the Foreign Affairs Policy Board, which you will recognize, mirrors the
comparable DOD Defense Policy Board that has been in operation for years.

Would you be willing to serve on this board for a two-year term? I plan to hold three board meetings per year at the
State Department. We will try to have the first one this fall.

All members will be appointed as Special Government Employees (SGEs). As such, they will be required to complete
Confidential Financial Disclosure Reports before their first board meeting.

The board meetings will be classified. All members will maintain State Department security clearances for the duration
of their terms.

As a member of this board, you will not receive a salary, but will be reimbursed for travel, lodging and per diem
expenses incurred to attend the meetings in Washington, DC.

I am delighted that you are willing to accept this invitation, I am copying Jake Sullivan, Director of Policy Planning, and
asking that a member of my staff contact you to start the necessary paper work process.

I am delighted we will (finally) be working together again. If you have any questionsn for me, pls contact me directly thru
this email. I look forward to seeing you soon. All the best, H

Dear Hillary,

This is indeed still my email. I am sorry I missed your call. I listened to your message and tried to call you back but your
cell did not pick up. I am honored by your invitation to join the new board you are setting up. Let me know when it
would be convenient to schedule a call. I will be in the US through September 5, then away for two weeks, and then in
NYC-DC during the week of September 19.

Hi, Lauraâ€”

It's Hillary Clinton. I just called your cell and left a message, but I thought I'd find out whether you were still reachable
thru this address because I'd like to talk w you at your convenience.
