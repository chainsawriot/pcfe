I'm pushing for Mar 15 but are you okay with ICC?

Jake — We may be headed to a vote more quickly than I thought. They are back in chambers now. Brazilians right now
appear to be giving up and letting us keep in the language we insisted on that states that are not party to the ICC having
sole jurisdiction over their citizens. The only real question is China and India, and the Libyan PR's letter today explicitly
asking for the ICC referral may mean that the direct referral remains in place. One potential compromise that has been
floated is an automatic referral on March 15 unless the UNSC votes otherwise.
     I wanted to triple check that HRC is OK with this as we may be voting within the next 45 minutes. I tried to call
you and left a msg as well. — Erica
