SRAP has been in touch with embassy and is eager for Raj to go. We can check in with Judith.

Pls talk w S/Rap--and ask them to check w Embassy. Raj can also ask his AID Director in the country to check as well.
Anne P has been doing a very good job w press and there's delicate balance btw looking helpful and taking charge in a
way that might backfire. Judith McHale has been monitoring Pak press so she might have an opinion. Let me know what
you learn.

No, Raj hasn't discussed with anyone else - though realizes the difference in our embassies in l'Bad vs Haiti

As much as Jake and I would love you to go to Pakistan (you had to know this was coming) as a way to show support,
we're assuming that's not in the cards. (We'd be thrilled though to be wrong, it's a helluva PD opportunity.)

Absent you, we think you should *send* Raj on your behalf. AID is technically the lead, and he like in Haiti, could
probably help speed things along on the ground. He's up for going but only if you are 100% ok with the idea.

Jake and I think it's a distant second on our wish list, but it's the next best thing and he should definitely go.
