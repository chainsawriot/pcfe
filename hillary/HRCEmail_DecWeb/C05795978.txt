Subject:                           Iran State TV



Madam Secretary,

Iranian State TV is reporting that talks will take place as scheduled in Istanbul. Some reports also say Baghdad will be site
for round two. We have all countries (minus Iran of course) on a call with Cathy this morning after which Helga will call
Bagheri (who is already trying to reach her today).
                                                  but we will proceed nonetheless. Will let you know when all is complete.
Happy Easter to you and your family.
Wendy
