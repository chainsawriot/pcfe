Subject: UK hesitation about recognition language in CG statement

We are working the chairs' summary now with the pol dirs and UK has asked that we bracket part of para 5 (recognition
language) because they are concerned that this is more forward leaning than they may be comfortable with. Geoffrey
Adams said that he had not yet had a chance to get Hague's approval for this language since the FS is traveling so asked
that we bracket the language until tomorrow when ministers meet in the smaller core group format.




Here is how para 5 reads now, with the UK bracket in caps:

The Contact Group noted that the Qadhafi regime no longer has any legitimate authority in Libya. Qadhafi must go.
Henceforth and until an interim authority is in place, the participants agreed to deal with the TNC as (THE LEGITIMATE
GOVERNING AUTHORITY IN LIBYA). The group welcomed the role of the TNC in leading the transition process in Libya
and supports its efforts to broaden its popular base to embrace all Libyan people. The Group urged all relevant parties
to explore ways and means of paving the way for the formation of an interim government to ensure a smooth and
peaceful transition of power with the widest popular support possible. In line with the TNC's "Road Map," the formation
of an interim government should be quickly followed by the convening of a National Congress with representatives from
all parts of Libya.
