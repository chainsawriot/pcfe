HRC

Find attached a memo for your plane ride home.

It lays out the issues, challenges and recommendations for how we address government to government funding
expectations that USAID has.

Can you review as you fly and we can discuss on Saturday or on Monday when I am going to get some of your office
time?

Thanks.

Monica

This is sensitive so can you ensure you print and you hand the only copy to S?

Thanks.
