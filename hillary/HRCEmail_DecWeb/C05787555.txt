I just connected with French Amb Delattre. He very much appreciated the call, and for "showing solidarity in a
meaningful way" with their loss. He also expressed condolences for our own Iocc of 6 Marinas tnriav




I also reached out to the French SRAP, but we missed each other by phone, and given the late hour, I sent him an email
expressing condolences. Please pass this info along, as appropriate, to others with interest in this in the bldg, incl EUR
and the 7th fl. Thx.

In that case, we may want to wait on the Amb call until after the Juppe call has happened.

P is with the political directors today. She conveyed to her French counterpart our condolences and requested that they
not do anything rash in light of Sarkozy's comments.
 I understand a S call to Juppe is in the works.
