Can we let WH know they need to move and let Senators know we're close?

It is done. Just waiting for WH to announce. It would be good for you to meet him. His name is Derek Mitchell and he
will be coming on board from Gates' policy shop in the Pentagon once he is confirmed. He has worked with ASSK in the
past and is a terrific fellow. Kurt.

I read today that Feinstein and McConnell just wrote to ask me to name the Special Envoy to Burma which I thought we
had done. What's the status of this?
