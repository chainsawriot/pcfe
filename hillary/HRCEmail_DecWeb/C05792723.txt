           Dear Madam Secretary:

              It has been a pleasure and an honor to serve you and the President
           in Afghanistan. We have seen extraordinary developments over the
           past year, including the conclusion of the Strategic partnership
           Agreement and its associated Memorandum of Understanding.


                                                                     It is with
           great reluctance that I must ask that you and the President accept my
           resignation this July at a date convenient to you.

               Once again, it has been an honor to serve.

                                                    Sincerely,



                                                    Ryan C. Crocker
                                                    Ambassador




            The Honorable Hillary Rodham Clinton
               Secretary of State
                  Washington, DC.
