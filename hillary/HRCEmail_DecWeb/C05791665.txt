Hurray! Great work. And I'd love to do forward--even if I'm not still here, we should because it was decided now.

We have finally negotiated an agreement with NDU, DOD and the Joint Chiefs for a book on Women, Peace and Security
to be published by NDU (God bless Nancy McEldowney). It is all agreed to and we have the budget. If we can move this
along, our hope is that you and Panetta will do the Foreward, and the contributors will be key leaders who have
expertise on the various topics appropriate to the National Action. Plan. It will be such an important achievement to get
this done and have it officially adopted by NDU. I wanted you to know should someone raise it with you.
