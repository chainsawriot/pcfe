Just fyi, Senator Kerry is planning to add a day in Pakistan to the tail end of his quick trip to Afghanistan the end of this
week. It would put us into Islamabad on Sunday night and out Monday evening. I think it's a good opportunity to defend
the relationship and ask some tough questions of the Pakistanis at the same time.
