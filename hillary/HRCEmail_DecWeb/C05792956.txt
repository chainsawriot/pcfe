I sat next to George . Soros at dinner during the Democracy Alliance and after the topics of Europe and China, he started
discussing President Obama. I told him I worked for you in the primaries and he said he's been impressed that he can
always call/meet with you on an issue of policy and said he hasn't met with the President ever (though I thought he
had). He then said he regretted his decision in the primary - he likes to admit mistakes when he makes them and that
was one of them. He then extolled his work with you from your time as First Lady on.

You probably have heard this all before but on the off chance you haven't, I thought I should let you know.

Thanks again for doing the video!

Neera
