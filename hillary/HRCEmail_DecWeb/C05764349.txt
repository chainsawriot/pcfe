  MEMORANDUM FOR LIEUTENANT COLONEL ALFREDO NAJERA, USA
              ACTING EXECUTIVE SECRETARY
                 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

 SUBJECT: Request for DOD Disaster Assistance to Samoa

        The Department of State (DOS) requests that Department of Defense (DOD)
 provide transportation assistance for US based donated commodities, to the
 government of Samoa (GOS) in response to the September 29 earthquake and
 tsunami in the Pacific Ocean. The Secretary of State understands, after
 communication with Representative Eni Faleomavaega, that the GOS will accept
 donated food and non-food commodities and that this assistance should be
 provided. The U.S. Charge d'Affaires in Samoa, Arnold Campbell, declared a
 disaster in State cable Apia 21 (012335ZOCT09).

       In particular, the DOS requests DOD support in transporting donated
 commodities from California to Samoa in accordance with a request received from
 the Honorable Eni Faleomavaega, Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Asia,
 the Pacific and the Global Environment. A copy of that request along with a list of
 donated items and their location is attached to this memo.

        We request that DOD-provided assistance be provided on a non-
 reimbursable basis under such authorities as are available to the Department of
 Defense. USAID's Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) does not
 object to the request for utilization of DOD assets in support of these efforts.

        The point of contact for this request is the DOS Desk Officer for the South
 Pacific Islands, Doug Carey (careydg@state.gov).
