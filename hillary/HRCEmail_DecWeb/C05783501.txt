Subject: Thailand Aid



SecDef has on his desk the Thailand Aid conop and the memo out to PACOM approving the operation. There B 5
is also a memo to State noting same. These will get signed in the next few hours.

Earlier today he gave the VOCO on this to the 3, so this is the paper catching up.




Thanks for everyone's work on this. Happy Veterans Day to all.

(Note to our Exec Sec: If anything needs to be pushed through tomorrow, please make arrangements to do
so. CDR Getz should have the actual paper from the SecDef.)
