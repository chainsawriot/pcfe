Apologies for the delayed response on this.

I spoke with the WHL and Chief of Staff for U/S for Policy. I did not share the name, only that we may want to make a
recommendation.

The board currently has 23 members. Under its charter, they can have up to 28 members. There is no formal
nomination process. Members can be appointed at any time

They aim to have a balance between D and R members, but there are no formal requirements for membership other
than general background in defense and national security affairs


I attached the current list of members here.


Let me know if you need anything further on this.

Thx

I spoke with DOD's White House Liaison who is sending me information on any upcoming vacancies on the board and
requirements of membership.

I told him we may have someone we want to recommend, but wanted to get more information about the Board first. I
did not give any details.

I will forward you whatever he sends me.

Thx
