Pentagon chief calls India, China 'threats'

GROTON, November 17, 2011 (AFP) - US Defense Secretary Leon Panetta referred to India and
China as "threats" on Thursday, but his spokesman quickly sought to clarify his remarks.

The Pentagon chief, speaking to workers at a Connecticut shipyard that builds attack
submarines, described an array of threats facing the United States, including Iran, North
Korea and cyber attacks.

He then strayed from standard US policy rhetoric by adding India and China to the list of
security dangers, saying the United States would need to make clear to these "rising powers"
that it would not be pulling out of the Pacific region.

"We face the threats from rising powers, China, India, others that we have to always be aware
of, and try to make sure that we always have sufficient force protection out there in the
Pacific to make sure they know we're never going anywhere," he said.

 The US government never openly portrays China as a security threat, even though it frequently
 voices concern about Beijing's military buildup and assertive stance in the South China Sea.

 As for India, US officials view the country as an increasingly vital ally and the Pentagon is
 anxious to bolster security ties.

 Panetta's comments came at an awkward moment just as President Barack Obama was on a tour to
 promote a renewed US focus on the Asia-Pacific region, including a stepped up military
 presence.

 Pentagon spokesman Captain John Kirby told reporters later that Panetta did not view China or
. India as military threats.

 "Any suggestion that he was implying that either country was a military threat is just
 false," Kirby. said.

 "He was referring instead to the challenges these rising powers face within themselves,
 challenges that we share with them as we try to forge better relationships going forward in a
 very turbulent, dynamic security environment."
