Update. I just spoke to Wendy Sherman. She said HAK is not going, but Brent Scowcroft is. They leave tomorrow
morning (or at least Wendy does). Also Joe Nye, Lieberthal, Nick Burns, Mike Green, David Ignatius, Phil Zelikow, David
Sanger, and others. It's an Aspen Institute-sponsored US-EU-China trilat. It's possible Scowcroft may have side
meetings; I don't know, haven't spoken to him.
