Miguel

Our energy team had a meeting with Lugar today.

In course of that meeting, Senator Lugar himself asked about Carlos and when we were going to get his paperwork up
there. They advised there will not be moving any nominations after April.

I flag this as I know it is consistent with outreach you did today, but just wanted an fyi.

How should we proceed on getting his paperwork up there.

Amos gave me a readout of meeting with Lugar.

Very positive for Carlos, but stressed we need to get his paperwork up there ASAP. This is a top priority for Lugar.

I can either debrief you.

Thx
