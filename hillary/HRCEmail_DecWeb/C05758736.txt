Dear Congressional Leaders,




We are writing to urge you to support President Obama's requests regarding the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as
part of the Conference Report on H.R. 2346, the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2009. These requests, including a
new commitment to the IMF's New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) and its other components, will equip the IMF with
critical tools to help confront the continuing global economic crisis. We believe that the current instability poses a
significant risk to the long-term prosperity and security of the United States. With support from the United States and
our allies, the IMF will play an essential role in ending this crisis and reducing the economic and security risks it poses to
our nation and the world.




The global economy remains in the grip of the worst economic and financial crisis since the 1930s. Global GDP is likely
to fall by more than 2 percent this year and world trade by more than 10 percent. In testimony earlier this year, Admiral
Dennis Blair, Director of National Intelligence, described the global fiscal slump as our number one security threat.
Governments around the world, including some of our key allies, are weakened by the debilitating impact of this crisis.
The risk of a destabilization of governments in emerging market economies is real, as is a weakening of public support
for market-oriented economics and globalization. In particular, Central and Eastern Europe, which made the transition
to capitalism only twenty years ago, has been greatly affected by the crisis.

We know from the 1930s that a protracted global economic slump can foster undesirable and unforeseeable reactions
to hardship and adversity. Financial hardship and poverty breed desperation, which helps terrorist networks to attract
new recruits with messages of hate, violence and intolerance.

IMF financing reduces this threat by reducing economic instability in vulnerable states. The Fund has been able to act
swiftly to avoid crises in Pakistan and other countries, and is lending strong support to key U.S. allies including Mexico,
Poland and Colombia.




The NAB commitment the President has proposed will be matched by over 500% from other countries. With adequate
funding, the IMF will strengthen our national security by mitigating the economic crisis and inhibiting the growth of
terrorist networks. We ask you for your support for this critical contribution to the IMF and the supplemental
appropriations bill.




Sincerely,




Hillary Rodham Clinton

Secretary of State




Robert M. Gates

Secretary of Defense




General James L. Jones USMC (Ret.)
