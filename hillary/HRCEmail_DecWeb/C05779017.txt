As per Jake's note last night, I responded to Khanfar reiterating that                S have repeatedly called for
protection of freedom of press. I contacted Khanfar this a.m. and asked for an update on what is happening to AJ in

Dear Judith: Yes, they have issued Al Jazeera Network (both Arabic and English) with a closure notice, threatening
criminal action if our reporters continue in any way to do their jobs. The Ministry of Information has also formally pulled
the accreditation of Al Jazeera reporters and told AP and Reuters that their accreditation will be withdrawn if they
provide us with any pictures or material. And in an unprecedented move, we have just learned now that the Minister of
Information has ordered NILESAT to remove altogether AL Jazeera Network's bouquet from NILESAT—leaving our North
African based audience completely in the dark.

We are looking for alternatives as we speak—your suggestions most welcome.

The security forces have cut our phone lines in Cairo and blocked our internet service.

Once again, our journalists are in the crossfire and forced to improvise.

As in Tunisia, our Network will adapt and overcome.

But if you can weigh in on the matter, we would appreciate being able to do our jobs.

Dear Judith:

My Cairo staff have called just now to say the police are on their way
to shut down al-jazeera's Cairo bureau offices. They have left
messages for us to prepare ourselves, and we plan to do rolling
coverage right up until the last arrest is made.

As you know, the Egyptian people (and much further afield) are
counting on us to bring the most up to date information on what is
happening on the ground. We have braved bullets, tear gas and
baton-wielding police until now to do so.

Al Jazeera sees this as a dramatic escalation against not only the
liberties of the Egyptian people, but the hope of free press in the
Arab world. It is being done by America's top ally, at least in part,
by general omar suleiman, the intelligence chief.- turned unelected
vice-president, an al jazeera critic.

We appeal to the us government, as the largest financial and political
aid contributor to the government of Egypt, to stop this crack down on
our staff and journalism, in keeping with your legendary ideals and
values.

Sincerely



WADAH KHANFAR
