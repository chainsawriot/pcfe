Subject: USIP message for S

You may remember that the Secretary delegated Mike to serve as the Department's representative on the Board of the
U.S. Institute for Peace. Since Dick Solomon announced his retirement a few months ago, the Board's search
committee hired the Isaacson Miller Search Firm to find appropriate candidate as successor. (Dick Solomon's tenure
began in 1992, fyi. Board votes tomorrow on successor. Then after he's on board, search begins for successor to Tara
Sonenshine as exec VP)

Amb. George Moose called to give us a heads up that tomorrow afternoon the Board will vote on the consensus
recommendation of Jim Marshall to be the new President and CEO of USIP. The Board wanted to be sure that the
Secretary was aware before the vote.
If this person raises alarm bells, the Board would like to know, and if there's neutral or positive reaction we'll be able to
so note from the State Dept. In any case, USIP asks that we hold close the information.

Jim Marshall was Democratic Member of House from Georgia until he was defeated in 2010, and member of armed
services committee. Before that he was mayor of Macon, lawyer, Vietnam veteran. Wiki bio:

I'll be at Board meeting and Mike will call in for the actual vote. Please let me know if there's anything you'd like me to
convey other than that the Secretary was informed. Mike's vote would signify Department's agreement
