Subject: Message from Ambassador Anne Derse

Dear Cheryl â€” I wanted to ask your assistance in passing a message of thanks to Secretary Clinton. She came twice to
Lithuania during my tenure, and I greatly, personally appreciated her visits and terrific support for the work we did
here. She is an inspiration and exceptional role model for women everywhere.


                                             I nonetheless wanted to relay to the Secretary how much I appreciated her
confidence in me and her suggestion to Marc. Thank you, Cheryl, for your help. If there is a better way to get this
message to her, please let me know and I will follow up. Anne Derse
