Hi Nora,

Hope the New Year is treating you well. Very calm as usual, I assume.

I'm writing to ask a favor of Cheryl.                                                                           B5
                                                                                                                B6



I would really appreciate you taking this to Cheryl or arranging for me to talk to her for 15 seconds.

Thanks so much.
