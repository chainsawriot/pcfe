Melanne/Anita â€” we had an excellent meeting with Rachel and Jennifer today and I think we have a great plan for
moving forward on the training front. Your folks have done a wonderful job in developing the kinds of background
materials we need to move forward. We are agreed to put a working group in place immediately to begin work on a
classroom course and modules that can fit in to other courses like pol-econ tradecraft. We will have these up and
running with our fall training agenda. We also will be working on a Distance Learning course. On a parallel track our
policy roundtable folks are already working with your team on the first of a series of policy roundtables that will help us
flesh out issues, develop the audience, identify key speakers etc. The other good news is we have reached out to the
AID gender integration folks (Carla Cassel who I met at Melanne's session at the COM conference)) and they are very
interested in participating. I hope particularly that the distance learning course can be a "joint" State-AID product along
the lines of our recently launched QDDR inspired "Diplomacy and Development" on line course I believe we have an
excellent plan for fulfilling the commitments expressed in the Secretary's recent cable. I know how important this
initiative is to the Secretary and you have my commitment to assuring that we not only develop great training but assure
it is institutionalized in FSI's curriculum. Best regards, Ruth W.
