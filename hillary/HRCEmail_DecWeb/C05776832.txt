Dear Ms. Mills,

Thought the Secretary might like to know that a group of us through labor, womens organizations, environmentalists
and Hispanic organizations are working to obtain a Presidential Medal of Freedom for Dolores Huerta, a good friend of
HRC. President Clinton awarded one posthumously to her UFW co-founder Cesar Chavez and we thought it would be
nice if Dolores could receive hers while she is still with us. The letter which is circulating is appended.

Sincerely,

Martin Chavez
