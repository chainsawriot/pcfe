Re: P


There is some speculation in the press about the "P" job at State to replace Bill Burns. I have no opinion of my own; nor
have I freely offered opinions about others in the past about jobs for this or that; nor do I know Dan Fried, who is among
those mentioned. But I just thought I would pass along, for however you wish to take it, John Kornblum's unsolicited
opinion, for its unvarnished tone:

"Just for the record, if she does not already know it,             is one of the biggest jerks in the foreign service. Not only
can he not get along with people or t1 !. ink clearly on anythina he also went over totally to the dark side during the Bush
administration. He is in a league with                                    on this one. He once literally shouted me down at a
conference where I suggested the Bush administration was hurting US relations with Europe."
