Briefly, from end of 90s we started to reduce levels, in part because of improvements in incomes/social indicators and in
part due to budget pressures, At the beginning (post camp david), when levels included a lot of commoddiitties it was
running about a billion a year. As cash became more predominant, it went down to about 800 a year and that is when
what was called the "glidepath kicked in with planned decreases to the 250 level over several years up til around 2008 -
with some blips along the way. There also some special events like iraq one that got them extra.
