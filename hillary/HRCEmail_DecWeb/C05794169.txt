Dear Sheldon--

I am so sorry about the murder of your friend, the journalist, Marie Colvin, and the State Department will do everything
we can to help bring her home. Since I am in London, I am copying Cheryl Mills and Pat Kennedy asking them to follow
up w you and your Senate office to coordinate our efforts.

Please extend my condolences to her family and friends, H

Marie Colvin, the American reporter who was killed in Syria today, was a close college friend.

                                                                                                         . Can you let
me know?
