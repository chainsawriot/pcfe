Subject: RE: PA Update 2- March 11

The Ministers of Justice, International Cooperation have just finished their speeches to the PA. Hearing their
speeches, there was nothing new to what they previously stated to the press and at the Shura Council. Here are
few points that I would like to highlight in their speeches:

   •     The Minister of Justice repeated that he has no authority over the Judiciary system and that he had no
         role to play in this whole issue confirming the independency of Judiciary. He also said that both the
         Prosecutor General and Chiefs of the Supreme Constitutional Court have the authority to question the
         judiciary.

    •    Fayza Aboulnaga repeated what she said at the Shura Council regarding the history of USAID, the
         decline in assistance starting in 2007 to reach $250 million annually, the direct assistance to NGOs
         against the will of the government, the huge amount of money that were provided to the NGOs right
         after the revolution, etc.... She also said that some of the American NGOs were involved in political
         activities in violation to the law. She said that she asked the U.S. that Egypt graduates from the U.S.
         economic assistance in 2007 but that the U.S. refused and thus no new agreements were signed for a
         couple of years until President Obama came on board and his administration promised to inform the
         government of any direct funding to NGOs.

    •    Please note that when she was talking about the reduction in USAID in 2008, many MPs shouted
         "WE DO NOT WANT ASSISTANCE".

    •     Finally, she was just confirming that she was right to feel suspicious and to support referring the case to
          the investigating judges.

    •     She seemed very self-contained, her tone was strong and assertive. So in short, she did not add anything
          new, but just justified her own position towards the case confirming that she was right and that the
          activities of the NGOs after the revolution raised many questions.

Importance: High

The PA Speaker El Katatny said the following in his opening remarks of today's session re the foreign
funding case (still going on up till this moment, PM Ganzoury is not there, Aboulnaga is representing the
government ):-

 The Egyptian people were shocked by what happened in the foreign funding case and by the sudden lifting of
 the travel ban of the defendants and their travel. This case has caused lots of anger among the people and it is
 the responsibility of the PA to investigate this issue and to confront the government and seek explanation to
 what happened. The government has allowed these organizations to work without registration in violation to
 the law. The PA has denounced the travel of the Americans and I confirm that the PA refuses any threats to the
 Egypt's national security and we fully reject and refuse this bold interference in Egypt's internal affairs. We
 fully refuse any threats against Egypt and we refuse the use of USAID as a political pressure. The U.S. should
 realize that Egypt will never accept this after the revolution. Those who interfere in our internal affairs and
 threaten our National Security should realize that the Egyptian people will never accept this again at any cost. It

is the responsibility of the Egyptian Parliament to interrogate whoever was responsible for these law
violations. We announced our refusal to this interference and threats that the Congress is still practicing up till
this moment, as they are now requesting to drop the charges completely. We urge American to stop its double
standards and we ask what is the real meaning of democracy and human rights in the light of what is happening
in Palestine and at el Aksa. I urge the whole world to refer to human rights laws and to the U.N. resolutions and
to refuse that any country interfere in the internal affairs of any other country in the world.

Few observations:

    • The PA Speaker was using very strong tone when addressing the U.S. and refusing threats and
      interference
    • He indicated more than once that these NGOs represent a threat to Egypt's national security
    • He referred to the most recent Congressional statements describing them again as "interference"
