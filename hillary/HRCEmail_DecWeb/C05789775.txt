They reached out to Muscat to sked call for Thurs. They are still inclined to deliver letter in NY tomorrow or Tues (but
will reference in Thurs call).

We're close on acceptable Tunisia language. Once we have it we'll tee up call for you.

           Cheryl connected on Cuba. Not sure result.

FYI:                                                                        Wendy to let Helga know that if Geneva doesn't   B5
work out in her call with her counterpart tomorrow, we won't stand in way of l'bul. Wendy stressed that we should give
one last shot to Switz, but agreed that if that fails we won't be inflexible.
