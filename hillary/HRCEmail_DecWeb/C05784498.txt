I don't know, to be honest. I will check. My hypothesis is that they don't have empowered civilian officials to talk
military policy and we do; so it's a difference in systems.

Also, why do we have Michelle F leading mil discussion when they have a General?

First, happy mother's day!


Would be good to bug         again this evening at the Dai dinner on


EI-Obeidy got across the border and was picked up by the French embassy. They are not telling us much, other than
hinting that she may already be gone from Tunisia. I've been in touch with Khalil.


Joint Staff is supposed to be working with NATO on advice for how to intensify. More on that as it unfolds.


See you tonight at the dinner.
