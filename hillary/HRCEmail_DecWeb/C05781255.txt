Subject:                           Lavrov additional points


Alice asked that I pass along to you these additional points for lavrov:
A couple of updates regarding the Lavrov call:

•    Libya: Russian Special Envoy Margelov was in Tripoli yesterday, where he met senior officials (but not Qadhafi),
who confirmed that Qadhafi insists on remaining in the country. PM Mahmudi, in a two-hour press conference with
journalists, said Qadhafi's departure was a "red-line" for the regime.•
 1267: In NY yesterday, our teams reached agreement on a text,


                                                                                           Bill Burns also raised this with
Deputy FM Karasin yesterday. ###
