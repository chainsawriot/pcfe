But, we should invite Amb for lunch and then for mtg is it +4? If so, I'll have Mitchell, Burns, Feltmann and Jake.

As it turns out, Amb Jim Cunningham is in town and has apparently made contact                  about coming to lunch.
We wanted to check with you to see if he should be our plus one instead of Bill Burns since he is here in Washington.
