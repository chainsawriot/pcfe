We've come to a point where certain decisions need to be made regarding the nomination of
continue his service as                          You will recall he was



As many of you will recall, last yea       faced stiff and very public opposition from Senators Boxer and
Menendez, both of whom said they would take all steps available to them to block
confirmation. Both Boxer and Menendez
                                                                     Conversations with Menendez and
Boxer's staff suggest the Senators are unrelenting in their opposition; however, both Senators have said
they would support                      to another post.

Another element here is that Senator Lugar is a big supporter of                    Senator Lugar wants to make

their opposition.

Thanks for your thoughts.
