Jake and Bill,
Marc called at 0500EST to report:
+He, Ryan and Frank met for 90 minutes with Stanekzai. They went over
every point of apparent contention raised by GIRoA sources in the WP article. They discussed each element of our plan:
                                                                                                                          1.4(B)

                                                                                                                          B1




+Marc, Ryan and Frank will see Karzai at 5pm for 90 minutes to two
hours.
+ They will call      and me again then to provide a read-out and to                                                   B5

of other steps below.                                                                                             1.4(D)
+ In his speech to Parliament this morning in Kabul, Karzai said nothing                                          B1
that causes the USG any problem. News reports have him announcing his meeting with HIG, which we already know
about.

In the meantime, the plan is:
                                                                                                                            1.4(D)

Marc (calling from Kabul) asked for a conf call with us at 1pm EST. He reported that he had just had a strategy session
with Kabul Dep Amb Jim Cunningham and Executive Ambassador David Pearce (Ryan Crocker was                                    B6
               so wasn't there, but his views were fully represented by Cunningham and Pearce.)


They discussed today's Wash Post story, which is replete with quotes from Afghan officials trashing the USG
reconciliation effort.


Marc's plan:
                                                                                                                          1.4(D)

I am trying to reach you by hone also to discuss some of the considerations that Marc,       and I discussed.                B5
