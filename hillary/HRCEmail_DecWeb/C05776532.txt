Tom--

I know our offices have been trying to set up a secure call. The time offered, 9:45 Friday morning, is not workable for me
since I have a commitment from 10-1. I can do a secure call anytime today before 7pm, Friday btw 2-4pm, or Sat or Sun
btw 9-12. Do any of these work for you?

Thx--and looking forward to catching up. H
