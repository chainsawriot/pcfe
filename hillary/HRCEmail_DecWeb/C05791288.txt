Madam Secretary,

Secretary Panetta just called me to ask that I convey to you his deep thanks for your stewardship of this negotiation with
Pakistan. It was the right outcome. As you recommended in Chicago, having the Nides-Miller dream team close this deal
was the smart strategic move.

Secretary Panetta also asked that I wish you and President Clinton a great Fourth of July.

Best regards,
