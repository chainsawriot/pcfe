Madam Secretary,




In addition, I am planning to go to Riyadh after Baghdad to brief GCC ministers and then on to Israel for a Friday morning
debrief with them. Helga will join in Riyadh following a discussion Cathy and Bill had in Jordan last week.




Finally, my guess is that some time will be spent on changes in Israel and their implications, if any.

Please feel free to call if you need any further information or updates. I should also mention that you will have
opportunities in Chicago to speak with your colleagues about the issues and the G8 will include a statement on Iran in
the communiqu√©. Many of my colleagues will be here at the end of next week and will travel to Baghdad from
Chicago, stopping in Amman for an evening E3+3 meeting before going into Baghdad on May 23 on our planes. Both
our embassies in Jordan and Iraq are doing a terrific job supporting all of the E3+3. And, finally, and importantly, thank
you for all of your support for this very complex and difficult effort.

Best,
Wendy
