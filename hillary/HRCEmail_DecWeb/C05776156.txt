Sid,
I would be most appreciative if you would forward this note and the attachment to Secretary Clinton. Thank you. Joe

Dear Madame Secretary,

I will be traveling to Baghdad on September 6 in my capacity as Chairman of Symbion Africa and senior corporate officer
of Symbion Power, both American firms,. The purpose of the trip is to meet with U.S. Military contracting and audit
officials to attempt to resolve some claim issues related to work Symbion has undertaken in Iraq. As you will see from
the attached memo, these claims have been languishing for two years now, and despite a ruling by the Armed Services
Board of Appeals in our favor, they still languish pending an audit that should have been conducted at the time the
claims were initially submitted. The delays in settling these claims are unwarranted and have had a negative impact on
Symbion and obliged us to be out of pocket a considerable sum of money through no fault of our own.

This will be my first trip back to Baghdad since I left there on January 12, 1991, four days before the launching of Desert
Storm. As you will recall, I was in charge of the embassy in Baghdad throughout the Desert Shield part of the first Gulf
war and was responsible for the safe evacuation of several thousand Americans from Kuwait and Iraq, and for the
release of over 125 American hostages held by the Saddam regime. I was also/the last American diplomat ever to
confront Saddam Hussein directly and in person. This is the 20th anniversary of that tumultuous time so my return to
the scene of some of my most important diplomatic work will be full of memories. I would welcome whatever
courtesies the embassy finds appropriate to extend given my extensive involvement in that conflict, as well as my role in
the debate surrounding the second Gulf War. In particular, lodging inside the Green Zone, if available, would greatly
facilitate my contact with military and embassy officials, as Symbion's offices and housing are outside, which makes
travel back and forth to meetings problematic given the security situation. I will be accompanied by our attorney. Close

protection security will be provided by Hart Security, also one of the companies under the Symbion umbrella. Hart is
well known in Iraq and to U.S. authorities.

I plan to depart Baghdad on Saturday, September 11. I would be pleased to report back to you my impressions of the
situation on the ground (unvarnished, as always), should you wish.

With warmest regards, and congratulations on having gained a son-in-law.

Joe
