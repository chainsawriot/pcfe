Yes, that is great for time and place. La Madeleine is right there at 7607 Old Georgetown Rd with parking and Starbucks
is at 4520 East West Hwy. Do either of those work?

Am copying my home email in case this battery runs down.

Rick

I will be in Bethesda (7400 Wisconsin) from 10-ham today so could meet at 1115 in that area.

Assuming you have no preferred place and could meet up there, I am going to look on line for the nearest Starbucks or
similar place - will that work?
