Subject: Malawi compact signing

Cheryl:

MCC's compact with the Government of Malawi is scheduled to be signed in Malawi on Thursday, April 7. MCC Vice
President Patrick Fine is en route to Malawi now to sign the compact for the MCC.

Press releases went out last week and we received very positive responses. We continue to be engaged with civil
society and LBGT groups.

Thank you,
Daniel
