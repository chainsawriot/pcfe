Jake: 1. Over the past three days the South Africans have signaled at a fairly high level that Foreign Minister Mashabane
would welcome a bilat with the Secretary.
                                                                                                                                 B5

                                           2. On Friday, I met with Amb Diseko, South Africa's Deputy Director General
(Undersecretary equivalent). During our conversation,                                                                B1
                                                                                                                            1.4(D)
                                                                                                     Diseko took
the points on board, acknowledged there might have been some misunderstandings and said it would be useful for the
two principals to meet in New York. Diseko said she thought Mashabane would be open to this.                                     B5
