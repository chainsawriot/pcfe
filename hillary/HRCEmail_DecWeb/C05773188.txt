Here is a read-out of the meeting with Kyl in Az. Lots of follow-up questions and take-backs, but Jim Miller sensed Kyl
was looking for a way to help us in the lame duck (though he didn't say so explicitly). The schedulers are still working on
a meeting wed between you, the vp and kyl.

Below is high level summary of meeting (thanks to Natalie)

Will provide more later today

Summary

•   BLUF: Sen. Kyl said briefing was very helpful; very much appreciated the spirit of it; looks like the questions are
being answered. He said he would like to absorb all of this; would like Administration to fill in loose ends discussed at
meeting. He is looking at VP/SecState meeting as one decision point, but unsure will have time to talk to colleagues
before Wednesday.

•   Sen Kyl noted several times the challenge is to absorb all of this in time to evaluate and educate the Senate in order
to move New START in lame duck session. This is a lot at the last minute (no fault of anyone).

•  Need to tell the appropriators about all of this and the contingencies, so they will not be surprised later on. The
more transparency, the earlier, the better.

•   Sen Kyl worries about budget hawks and doves. Although the presumed logic that it will be easier to get funding if
New START is ratified is probably right, even with New START, need to ascertain that we have done all we can do to
ensure funding for the future.

•   Need to ascertain views of Republican colleagues in House and Senate; need Administration's help with Democrats.
He noted we can take their temperatures with respect to long-term commitment (referenced hand-written graph for
CMRR/UPF).

•   Sen Kyl was to call Senators Kerry and Sessions Friday afternoon.

Addressing Kyl Issues/Questions

•   Within 1251 Update:

o    Incorporate ten-year funding figures into Update to 1251 / Create an update for Table 3 of May 1251 Report

o    Determine timeline for W78/W88 decision. Include in Update to 1251.

o    Rework narrative on CMRR/UPF funding profiles and develop graph Sen Kyl recommended (more below).

o    Make clear Pantex is covered in FY12

o    State explicitly that "Administration is committed to LRSO"

-   For Kyl Separately

o    $190M needed to keep Oakridge National lab going for next 10 years?

o    Kansas City Issue with W76?

o    Timing of W78/88 common warhead decision — FY16?

o    Neutron Generators — He thought this should have been in the budget before, particularly a $30 million shortfall
for SNL. Noted we would get them an answer.

o    Tritium Production

-   Schedule: Address Kyl's concern that this is a lot of info to digest quickly and if we are to make a deal, need to get
on a schedule and make information accessible quickly.


-   Brief Force Analysis: Kyl recommend briefing to Thune and Sessions and the SASC (supposed to occur Wed or
Thursday).


-   Missile Defense: Morrison noted they cannot get anything from MDA — he is supposed to send us questions.
