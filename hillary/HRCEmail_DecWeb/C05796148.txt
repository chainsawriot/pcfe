 The Bahrain Dialogue Project
 Implementer: National Democratic Institute for International Affairs
 Project Timeline: Jul-11 to Jul-12
 Budget: $370,000.00
 Active Country: Bahrain

 This six-month project works in parallel to Bahrain's National Dialogue by
 engaging diverse political and civic groups, providing comparative examples and
 models of reform and offering consultative assistance as all sides seek a positive
 way forward. International mediation experts from South Africa participated in two
 delegations to Bahrain in May and June 2011, led by NDI's partner, the Project on
 Justice in Times of Transition (PJTT), to share their experiences and provide
 government, pro-government, and opposition leaders with direct access to
 individuals who successfully guided previous political transitions. The project has
 had little forward movement since summer 2011 due to the delegations' problems
 receiving visas to enter Bahrain. However, NDI is now (as of April 2012) working
 with PJTT to send a 10-member Bahraini delegation from various political
 affiliations and organizations to South Africa in order to draw on South Africa's
 past successful models for dialogue and negotiation that were used to bring
 opposition and government leaders to the table without pre-conditions.
 Specifically, the delegation would focus on fostering dialogue among government
 representatives, opposition groups, and civil society organizations and also discuss
 methods for constitutional development and reform in Bahrain. NDI and PJTT
 experts would offer models for addressing key issues and challenges in Bahrain
 and assist the delegation in identifying potential openings for dialogue.

 The Kuwait project below was run and managed from NDI in Washington, DC. We
 include it in this list for situational awareness and because there may have been'
 some minor logistical assistance provided by staff working at NDI 's Dubai Office.
 That said, there is no information in MEPI's grants file linking NDI's Dubai Office
 to this activity.

 Kuwait International Election Observations*
 Implementer: National Democratic Institute for International Affairs
 Project Timeline: Jan-12 to Feb-12
 Budget: $25,000.00
 Active Country: Kuwait

 This funding supported NDI's participation in an international election observation
 mission in Kuwait on February 2, 2012. Five NDI observers were invited by the
 Kuwaiti Government to monitor election polling stations and report potential
 violations to authorities. They also worked alongside approximately 300 domestic
 monitors and shared best practices and built local capacity in observation
 processes. The Kuwait Transparency Society covered all program costs; this
 funding was only used to cover the NDI team's travel, local transportation, meals,
 and lodging costs.

                             NDI GULF PROGRAMMING
                                 Department of State

 Summary of DRL Funding to NDI in the UAE

 Internet freedom:
    • FY10 Internet freedom grant: We have a $1.35m grant to NDI, signed in
       June 2011. This grant supports digital safety trainings for MENA activists
       and bloggers. These workshops take place in Istanbul and Beirut and take a
       "train-the-trainer" model, with participants expected to then lead digital
        safety programs within their own countries (under NDI's continued
        guidance). The workshops include training on circumvention and secure
        communications.

        There have been no Emirati participants in trainings and no workshops held
        in the UAE. Gulf-wide, there were 4 Yemenis and 3 Bahrainis involved in a
        January training in Istanbul; there was 1 Yemeni involved in a March
        training in Beirut. NDI's Dubai office is not involved in administering this
        program. In fall 2011, NDI attempted to recruit someone to work on the
        program out of the Dubai office, but did not find anyone with the right skills
        and decided to drop it. In NDI's words, "Since then and beyond that,
        nothing related to this program has been run, managed, or even linked to the
        Dubai office," nor has the office referred any participants for workshops.

     • FY09 Internet freedom grant: We have an FY09 grant to NDI, signed and
       started in August 2010, that originally would have had an Iran component
       involving the Dubai field staff We switched that country pilot to Belarus,
       so there has never been any Iran or MENA work under this grant, and
       no involvement by the Dubai office.

  Saudi Arabia grant:

     • FY07 Saudi Arabia grant: In 2008 DRL funded a Saudi Arabia program
       for $680K that focused on accountable and transparent governance which
       we believe was managed out of the UAE office (included no in-country
       trainings). The project ended early 2011, and we believe there were no
       program activities in UAE and most or all of the trainings were held in
       Turkey.

 Iran
 *DRL had an FY 2005 program managed out of the Washington office, that ended
 on June 30, 2007, to support Iranians working on democratic reform.

 Near East Regional Democracy Fund —NEA/USAID

 NDI runs a NEA-USAID Iran Program. One staff member, Slobodan Milic, is
 based in Dubai. Their project is an online program which aims to increase
 awareness of the absence of personal freedoms for Iranian citizens and draw
 attention to the issue during the parliamentary election season. Activities
 include an online platform that provides a vehicle for uploading, reporting and
 mapping of human rights issues occurring around the parliamentary elections. The
 program launched in September 2011. No program activities take place in Dubai,
 nor would Iranians travel to Dubai for this program.

 Although the program includes guidance on the safe and effective use of
 technology, as do most of USAID-NEA' s online programming, this program does
 not deal with issues of circumvention or more general internet freedom/electronic
 communications objectives.

 Additional details:

     • Slobodan Milic was released on bail a couple of hours ago. Les Campbell
       believed that there was a travel restriction, so he is in his apartment in Dubai
       for the time-being.
     • According to NDI, the UAE's allegations in general are "completely false"
       and NDI has records to prove it. The allegations go back to 2005 and are
       less focused on recent/ongoing activities. Les believes that UAE is more
       interested in NDI's actual activities in the Gulf and that the Iran-focused
       activities out of Dubai will be less of a concern for them.

 Summary of MEPI Programming Managed from NDI's Dubai Office (2008-
 present)

 Expanding Support for Political Reform
 Implementer: National Democratic Institute for International Affairs
 Project Timeline: Sep-07 to Jan-12
 Budget: $3,790,000.00
 Active Countries: Yemen

 Also worked in Bahrain, Kuwait, and Qatar (Sep 2007 — Nov 2010)

 Program components in Bahrain, Kuwait, and Qatar were managed from the Dubai
 office and ended in November 2010. Over the course of approximately three
 years, NDI built the capacity of ministers of parliament, local councils, and
 CSOs to effectively communicate with constituents. CSO capacity was also
 strengthened in the areas of strategic planning, fundraising, and advocacy
 campaigning. In addition, political candidates and their supporters in Bahrain,
 Kuwait and Qatar also learned how to run issue-based campaigns with a focus on
 voter outreach, message development, new media, and "Get Out the Vote" field
 organizing. In Bahrain and Kuwait, the project put particular emphasis on
 preparing women candidates for election.

 A large portion of the total amount of funds was used in Yemen over the course of
 the award, and these funds were managed through NDI's office in Sana'a. NDI
 worked with established and emerging political parties to: inform them on political
 and electoral process issues and models; facilitate internal discussions to aid parties
 in reviewing and defining their positions on process options and reforms; and
 support constructive negotiations among political parties. NDI has facilitated
 dialogue between the two major political factions to foster parliamentary and
 electoral reform. The project also strengthened the capacity of parliamentary
 committees to develop strategic plans to address legislative challenges. NDI also
 completed a pilot project to strengthen the ability of local councils in six targeted
 districts across three governorates to develop, implement and monitor local
 budgets and to integrate civil society in budget development and oversight
 processes. NDI has also served as advisor to five Yemeni local grantees that have
 formed a countering early marriage network.

  Saudi Women's Community Advocacy Project**
  Implementer: National Democratic Institute for International Affairs
  Project Timeline: Sep-10 to Jun-12
  Budget: $400,000.00
  Active Countries: Yemen

  * *From September 2010 — October 2011 project funds were directed for work in
  only Saudi Arabia but did not place. In November 2011, funds were redirected for
  work in Yemen.

  This project    conceived as a women's community advocacy project with the
  following key objective: "Saudi women's knowledge and understanding of skills

  needed to advocate with municipal councils and local authorities on behalf of
  community issues of concern to women are strengthened." The intent was to train
  five women from four cities (a total of 20 women) across Saudi Arabia in the
  specific areas of policy advocacy, new media as an advocacy tool, and network
  building. These women would then work as city-teams to build local women's
  networks and enact a localized advocacy campaign on an issue of their choice. Due
  to sensitivities raised by the SAG Ministry of Foreign Affairs in late 2010 and
  2011 regarding training events held in the Kingdom with foreign trainers (for all
  USG programming), Embassy Riyadh raised concerns about the potential for
  friction with the SAG over this project given its forward-leaning "advocacy"
  approach. As a result, participant recruitment was halted, and the planned project
  activities never occurred.

  The scope of the project was revised in October 2011 to build the capacity of
  Yemeni political parties in skills necessary to engage in non-violent political
  dialogue, including crisis management, conflict mitigation and negotiations. The
  remaining funds were redirected to NDI's Yemen office.

  Enhancing Young Women's Political and Civic Engagement in Kuwait
  Implementer: National Democratic Institute for International Affairs
  Project Timeline: Jul-11 to Jan-13
  Budget: $850,000.00
  Active Country: Kuwait

  This project provides approximately 40 young Kuwaiti women the opportunity to
  gain hands-on experience working on policy issues and developing public service
  campaigns. The project features dual-tracked mentorships and internships at local
  CSOs or in government/policy-focused offices, allowing participants the
  opportunity to work together on policy issues during and after the February 2012
  elections. NDI is also providing intensive capacity building training to young
  women interested in participating in the electoral process as candidates or
  campaign managers and facilitating linkages with civil society to ensure
  community issues are being addressed by legislators. The NDI project manager
  had been residing since February 2012 in Kuwait to oversee the project. She had a
  90-day tourist visa that she planned to regularly renew on trips to Dubai when
  meeting with NDI's Dubai HQ team. The project manager is now in Washington
  until the situation is resolved. Embassy Kuwait is well aware of this project, and
  the Public Affairs team has been actively involved in attending project training
  events and meetings. Our Embassy Kuwait MEPI team has also met on several
  occasions with NDI's program team, including members of the NDI Dubai staff
