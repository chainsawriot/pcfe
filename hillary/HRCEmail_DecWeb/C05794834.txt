Subject: Photo gone Viral!

Not sure if you're aware of this photo and its recent "life" on FaceBook. Seems everyone is posting it. (Even people who
are not DoS employees!)
I'm now working in WHA/AND, still waiting for Adam Namm's confirmation. I do miss working w/ Tom Adams and the
Haiti gang!

Hope you're well,

Russell
