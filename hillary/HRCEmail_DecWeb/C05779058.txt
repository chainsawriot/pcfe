I can do anytime in morning starting at 7 or 8am and before 12 and would prefer earlier but will do whenever it's
convenient. Also, don't forget Mitchell and team.

Also, what is a good time to set con calls?

My thought is                                    and then one with the whole crew. Perhaps late morning?
