to a U.S.-sponsored Young African Women Leaders Forum. Forum participants will include young women from across
sub-Saharan Africa who are leading or involved in social and economic initiatives in their own countries. The Regina Mundi
Church holds particular historical significance for the people of South Africa and the Soweto community. During the anti-
apartheid movement, when political gatherings were banned, churches became a hub for activity. During the Soweto student
uprising of June 16, 1976 — when students such as twelve year-old Hector Pieterson were killed — a number of young people
ran to the Regina Mundi Church where they were followed by police and fired upon. The church remains a national symbol
of the struggle.

Mrs. Obama will then visit the Hector Pieterson Memorial, honoring the twelve year-old boy who protested apartheid and
was shot and killed by apartheid government police. An iconic news photograph documents Pieterson's body being carried
through the streets of Soweto with his distraught sister running along-side him. The date Pieterson was killed, June 16,
1976, has been commemorated as Youth Day in South Africa, and this year June has been declared Youth Month.
        Press Access: Access to this event is limited. To apply for credentials please email Matt La Lime, United States
        Embassy by Friday, June 17, 2011 at 12:00 noon at lalimemc@state.gov with your full legal name, media outlet,
