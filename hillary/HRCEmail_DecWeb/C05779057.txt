                                                                                                                      1.4(D)

 Per             and close advisors with whom we spoke today, the government will present its resignation to Pres Abbas
 tomorrow as part of the long-brewing process to have a government re-shuffle (which                      has been
 looking for for many months).



                                                                                                                           B5
 Once the government resigns, several weeks of political consultations will ensue for the formation of the next
 government under the PA Basic Law. Since more than 1/3 of the cabinet is expected to change, it was necessary to go
 this route vice substitution of a minister here or there.




                                                                                                                            1.4(B)
              expects that the consultations will be very broad, and will encompass civil society org's, the various PLO
                                                                                                                            1.4(D)
  factions, and political independents.
                                                                                                                            B1
  We will report more details tomorrow via front channel regarding expected reaction from different players (especially
  Fatah), as well as how this development does - and does not - relate to other issues such as the PLO's statement of
  intent re: presidential and legislative elections and regional events.

  This development is not directly linked to developments in Egypt, but as with the PLO announcement yesterday on
  legislative elections, the way this plays out could be affected by the post-Egypt need for greater popular legitimacy
  (hence the desire for factional consultations).
