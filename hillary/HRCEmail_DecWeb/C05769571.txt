Subject: Vz deports three Colombian traffickers to US

Jake: When I mentioned an arrest in Venezuela last week of a major Colombian drug trafficker and the possibility that
he'd be turned over to us, the Secretary asked "what about the others?" All three were put on planes today for the US,
as outlined below. After the "bios" are some comments from our AND director, and Acting DAS for S. America, Kevin
Whitaker. Thanks.

Carlos Alberto Renteria Mantilla, a/k/a "Beto Renteria," a citizen of Colombia and one of the leaders of the Norte Valle
Colombian Drug Cartel, was arrested in Venezuela on July 5, 2010. Carlos Alberto Renteria Mantilla has been designated
a Consolidated Priority Organizational Target.

Carlos Ojeda-Herrera, a citizen of Colombia and Venezuela, was arrested in Venezuela on May 30, 2010. Ojeda-Herrera
was the head of an organization which specialized in the transportation of multi-kilogram loads of cocaine and heroin
from Venezuela and Colombia, to the United States, Canada, Europe, and elsewhere.

It is anticipated Carlos Alberto Renteria Mantilla and Carlos Ojeda-Herrera will arrive in the District of Columbia on
Wednesday, July 14, 2010

Luis Frank Tello Candelo, also known as "Negro Frank," a citizen of Colombia, was arrested on June 24, 2010. Luis Frank
Tello Candelo was responsible for storing cocaine within Colombia, as well as paying corrupt Venezuelan authorities to
permit the cocaine to transit though their country on its way to Mexico.

It is anticipated that Luis Frank Tello Candelo will arrive in the Eastern District of New York on Tuesday, July 13, 2010.

Venezuelan government officials have cooperated with us and our partners on the arrests of several significant
Colombian traffickers who are wanted in the. United. States.

The most significant of the three is Carlos Alberto "Beto" Renteria. He was arrested on July 5 by Venezuelan
authorities. DEA informs us that the Venezuelans picked him up based on intelligence ultimately provided by the
Colombian National Police (CNP); the CNP shared this with a British drugs unit which in turn shared with the
Venezuelans. Beto is the last of the notorious Valle de Norte cartel, which was responsible for shipping multi-ton loads
of cocaine to the United States.

Two lesser traffickers had been previously arrested by Venezuelan authorities -- Luis Tello Candelo, aka "El Negro Frank,"
arrested June 23, and Carlos Ojeda Herrera, aka "El Ingeniero," arrested May 27. DEA informs these two were arrested
by Venezuelan authorities who had received tip information from our vestigial DEA presence in Caracas.

While our CN cooperation with Venezuela is almost non-existent, due to the government's reluctance to work with us
on a consistent basis, it does choose on occasion to make significant arrests and turn the individuals over to us. It is
virtually impossible to discern their motivation for doing so in these cases.

Regardless of their motivation, it is an objectively good thing that these three individuals will be facing justice for their
crimes in the United States. We welcomed the Venezuelan action, but take care not to praise them for taking actions
that they should be doing anyway.

Hope this is helpful. Roberta
