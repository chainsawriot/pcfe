Subject: Draft Palestinian resolution

Lebanese PR Salam called to inform us that Lebanon will put the draft resolution on settlements into blue within 24
hours based on a decision made in Sharm-el-Sheik. (This means that the draft can be voted on 24 hours after it is put in
blue if a UNSC member calls for a vote.). He said a decision when or whether to put it to a vote would be made later
subsequent to "how things develop".

Salam described a two-staged approach: first putting the draft in blue (to show their seriousness), and second a decision
on a possible vote based on an assessment of further developments. He said that the vote would not necessarily take
place this week but could not commit to timing at this point. He promised to keep in touch and plan to discuss the
matter further with Susan tomorrow.

It appears that the Palestinians are awaiting our next step.
