SBU

All -

Our mission in NYC got confirmation about 30 minutes ago that the Arab Group at their meeting today agreed that they
should go for a vote and would refer timing to ministers. The Qatar FM will be handling coordination of this. We also
received confirmation that no vote will take place before the meeting already schedule with Amb. Rice with a sub-set of
the Arab Group PRs on Tuesday next week, as previously promised to Amb. Rice.
                                                                                                                          1.4(D)
                                                                                                                          B1

The results of Susan's Tuesday meeting will, obviously, be important. She wants to ensure we make the best use of the
next few days so that she has all tools in hand to work this.

                                                                                                                             B5




Input on this system or, if more appropriate, SIPR, most welcome. Thanks - Erica
