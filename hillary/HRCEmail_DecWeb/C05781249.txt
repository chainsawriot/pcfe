Incredible. Congratulations to all, including David Pressman who pressed us to set after ambitious goals in this area..

I give South Africa great credit for going forward despite such a close vote - that took real courage. But our leadership
paved the way, no question. This may be among South Africa's most consequential acts on human rights in their foreign
policy, certainly in the last few years.

Subject: Lgbt resolution

The resolution on human rights for Igbt people-- first one in history-- just passed at Human Rights Council.

Pakistan called vote.

Vote was
Yes 23
Abstain 3
No 19

With US cosponsoring.

There were some fireworks--and the atmosphere was somewhat raucous. But all well in the end.

Team Geneva-- amb donahoe, melanie, mark, and esp sarah did.great work. Really historic stuff.


Congrats also due to wes and shane and the rest of the dc team too-- working on all the demarches and organizing last
minute phone calls etc.


A big win for human rightsâ€”expanding the circle of who counts as fully human, affirming the universality of human
rights.
