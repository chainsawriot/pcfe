I know-- I am really sorry that we're losing perception game. It kills me to let you down. I promise you that we are right
on substance and that we're poised to make you proud in the years ahead. Little comfort now, I know. I will keep
working to make this right.

I'm sorry that you keep having to deal with this. I'm confident that we are right on substance, that our programs are and
will continue to be effective at supporting people on the ground, saving them from real danger, giving them safe access.
We are about to distribute what will be the most competitive, cutting edge programming done for
democracy/development in the USG.

I spoke with Mike who is preparing a response for you that outlines where we are; Judith is in rome and was not able to
join the call so she does not yet have the feedback I shared with mike.

I am, as you might guess, concerned and surprised
              the facts she cites don't make us look good. What's the bottom line on what we've actually done?
