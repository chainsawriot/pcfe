Dear Derek,

As you are aware, DASSK was invited by President U Thein Sein. She will go to Nay Pyi Taw to meet him at
the office and then for a lunch with his family.
DASSK didn't meet with Senator Jim Webb. The planned meeting between Uncle U Tin Oo and Senator Webb
was also cancelled by Senator Webb at the last minute.
Meanwhile, the situation in Kachin is not good. Burmese military has reinforced its troops and heavy artilleries
in area around Laiza, KIO Headquarters, where over 25,000 IDPs are taking shelters. It looks like the Burmese
military is going to launch a major offensive against KIO Headquarters in Laiza.

Best regards,

Aung Din
