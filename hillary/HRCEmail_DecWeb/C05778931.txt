In a further conversation today between Amb. Rice and the Lebanese PR
                                    it was clear that this train cannot be slowed any longer. Absent game changing, strong,

Amb Rice to meet with her on Tues. (when she returns from a long -planned speaking tour on the west coast).

This is going to require a hard pull from all of us, and none of the options are good. But we need to make some key and
quick decisions.

Thanks much.
