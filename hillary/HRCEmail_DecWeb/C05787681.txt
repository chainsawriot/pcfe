Subject: SBU Version of Munter-Khar Readout

SBU readout below of Amb. Munter's conversations today with FM Khar and Amb.-designate
Rehman. Understand a classified version is forthcoming on the high side; will forward that to
Jake and Alice once received (and assess whether it's necessary for S to see).

      • Amb. Munter demarched Ambassador-designate Rehman delivering the talking points on
        U.S.-Pakistan relationship redlines as instructed. Rehman had no particular comment.

      • About two hours later Khar called in Amb. Munter, having heard about the call on
        Rehman, and asked for a preview of the Biden-Gilani call. Am. Munter previewed the
        talking points.

      • Although the atmospherics were cordial, Khar (accompanied by Bashir) commented that
        U.S. and Pakistani redlines (going after al-Qaeda vs. Pakistani sovereignty/territorial
        integrity) are in direct conflict. We need, she said, to do everything possible to maintain
        flexibility. If it is a question of capabilities in going after al Qaeda, we can act jointly.

           Khar asked "what's in it for us?" — give me something I can sell to
           Parliament." Apparently she was quite concerned, asking for U.S. ideas for ways to
           make the U.S. position more palatable to Parliament.

      • Amb. Munter noted that the "what's in it for us" question is part of negotiations — the "all
        else is up for discussion" angle of the demarche.

      • The Amb. and FM agreed that Petraeus and Pasha should meet very soon.

      • Cable should be out by about 10:30 EST.
