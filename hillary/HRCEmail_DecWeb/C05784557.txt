About to call Frank Lowenstein on war powers.

Trying to help Posner figure out how to approach Facebook, which is weighing entering the Chinese market and
accepting their censorship rules. This could be important.

Honduras vote likely Thursday but a small possibility it slips.

Talked to David about Quartet. The envoys will meet Wednesday and discuss when it makes most sense for Quartet
principals to meet.        says Abbas is weighing next steps and may/may decide to be constructive (   is usually a
pessimist.). Arabs are meeting Saturday on next steps on MEPP.

We're finalizing a letter to go out tomorrow from you and Geithner to G8 FMs and FinMins on MENA econ. Meanwhile,
my team is working on a Marshall (Clinton!) Plan.




That's about it for now.
