Read below.
1. This outrageous atmosphere needs to be combated.
2. An major interfaith committee should issue a statement calling for tolerance and mutual understanding and deplore the
hatred of Muslims.
3. A major retired military figure should make a statement that the hate campaign against Muslims in the US only aids and
abets our enemies, that it is a recruiting tool for Al Qaeda and the Taliban. If McChrystal wants to get well, it's a good one
for him. It's perfect for Colin Powell, but even an easy layup is hard for him. Even better, get a committee for retired
generals to issue a statement.
4. Get a committee of retired CIA and other intelligence officers to issue a statement. That I could get done quickly.
5. All of this should be coordinated for convergence.

                            this a checkpoint!" and
                            stabbed and slashed
                            Sharif with his knife,
                            leading to his
                            hospitalization. Reports
                            later revealed that

                            filled with anti-Muslim
                            rhetoric. Sharif, who
                            had been in the U.S. for
                            more than 25 years,
                            suggested to the pres s

                            surrounding Park 51
                            was endangering
                            Muslims in the city.
                            The week before the
                            attack in New York, a
                            brick was thrown at a
                            window of a mosque in
                            Madera, CA. Outside
                            the premises, vandals
                            put up a pair of signs:
                            "Wake up America, the
                            enemy is here" and "No
                            temple for the god of
                            terrorism." And this
                            past Friday, a suspected
                            arsonist set fire to part
                            of the construction site

                            Magazine poll released
                            earlier this month
                            found 61 percent of
                            Americans oppose the
                            construction of Park 51.
                            Even more

                            held a favorable view

                            that President Obama is

                             Sarah Palin took to
