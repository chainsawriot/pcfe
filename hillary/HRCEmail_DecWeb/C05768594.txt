Re: Shaun, NI, St. Patrick's Day

Shaun requests that he bring to the State Department to meet you on March 17 and to the Whhite House St. Patrick's
Day event a woman named Kate Carroll, the widow of a policeman murdered last year by the Continuity IRA, who has
been a key figure in the campaign for the peace process.

I have included Shaun's email to me below and a BBC story on Kate Carroll:

1.   Shaun's email on Kate Carroll

We discussed the possibility of arranging for HRC to meet Kate Carroll next week during the St Patrick's Day celebrations.

Next week Kate is coming to the United States on March 16th. Kate is an extraordinary woman whose voice on Tuesday (
the first anniversary of her husband Constable Stephen Carroll's murder ) was critical in persuading all the DUP to make
their vount count and ensure that the cross community vote succeeded.

.Kate would herself admit that before her husband's brutal murder, she was a quiet and timid person who would never
 have been found to speak up. Stephen's death led her to find her voice and make it vital.

Her courage in the days after Stephen's murder inspired all the politicians to come out and call for unity and peace.
Martin M and Peter R both visited her at home.

Since then Kate has tried to piece together her life. But this week she decided to speak out about the senseless of life
without Stephen and to use it as an appeal to everyone still engaged in violence in NI to stop.

On Tuesday she gave television and radio interviews, press and media coverage to her "terrible" anniversary. But she
wanted it to be used for peace. She appealed to the politicians to put aside their differences and vote for devolution.

Kate is a vital voice.

Kate now wants to set up a charity to encourage young people to reject the NI of the past and ensure that no young
person wastes their life in violence. In doing this she is a source of inspiration and leadership against conflict and those
who would be drawn in.

For HRC, I can only imagine that Kate is the model of 'vital voices." It would be wonderful to ask Kate to come to
Washington - probably on the morning of the 17th March - and bring her to State to meet the Secretary of State.
Perhaps also at HRC's invitation I could also bring her to the reception in the evening at The White House.

2.    BBC story

Murdered policeman's widow appeals to politicians For Kate Carroll, every Monday is a rerun of the day her husband
was shot dead.
She counts down the events of 9 March 2009 on the clock.
"Monday, 10 O'clock was when Steve would have rung me," she said.
"Half past ten - Steve died. At 20 past 11, Graham came to the door to tell me that Steve had been killed.
"I relive that all the time. That is just my Mondays."
Exactly a year ago, Constable Stephen Carroll, 48, was responding to a call for help in Craigavon. It was a trap.
The Continuity IRA was lying in wait. They shot him dead. He was the first PSNI officer to be murdered in Northern
Ireland.
Speaking shortly afterwards, Kate said his killers were "sick".
"They have robbed my son of his father, my grandkids of their grandfather, my mum of her son. And me of my life," she
said.
"Part of my life has gone. I feel now that I'm dead inside."
A year on, Kate Carroll said her pain was "as raw as ever".
"I don't think I have quite accepted that Steve has gone, although there is a grave to prove he is not there any more,"
she said.
"To me, Steve is still in my heart. I think about him every day I write to him every night. I can't move on from him but I'm
trying my best."
But with family and friends' support, she has worked to keep her husband's memory alive.
In her garden, there is a tree planted in his memory.
"It is my Steve's tree. It is called the ghost tree. It has a special meaning... I go out and look at it and I just love it," she
said.
A year ago, Steve Carroll was counting down time in his job, looking forward to a new kind of future with his family.
Before he left for work that Monday, he had talked about the increasing level of violence, after the murder of two
soldiers the previous Saturday.
"He said to me just as he was going out: 'Wouldn't it be ironic, just with my last year-and-a-half, that something would
happen?'
"He said: 'Love you, see you tonight'. We kissed each other at the door. He smiled and away he went. That was the last I
saw of him."

For Kate Carroll, the anniversary is one of the worst days she can think about.
As politicians in the Northern Ireland assembly prepare to vote on the transfer of policing and justice powers, she will be
remembering exactly one year ago, when her husband's regular phone call wasn't made, when the knock came to the
door that changed her world.
"I hope and pray that this will be the last policeman's wife who has to sit here and explain how she feels because her
husband has been taken away by a bullet."
But, she points out: "This is a very big day for Northern Ireland."
"Hopefully something good will come out of this. That's my role to make sure Steve hasn't died in vain. Nobody wants
this so-called war to be carried on."
