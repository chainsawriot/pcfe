Capricia:
- I'd skip samosas for this crew
- can they include dates on table too?
- lamb fish option better than chicken so long as its well cooked. Rice is good

Below is the menu for Dinner at the WH — asked them to make the canapes more hearty if there will be waiting time
between the press portion and dinner and the lamb option seems the best. As well, for the items on the table —1
suggested that they are more individualized in front of each person's plate.




The breaking of the fast and prayer will occur individually in the hold of each delegation as opposed to the State Dining
Room together. This is to take place just after the press conference and before the dinner. Between 7:35 and 7:50pm




Please let me know if I can convey any suggestions.
