Subject: UPDATE

 I called Fayyad, who supposedly is not in Baghdad directly, don't know where.

Fayyad assured me he would discuss the agreements with the PM tonight and would have feedback for me in time for
our 1100 meeting tomorrow. I reiterated PM's commitment to get this done asap, and reviewed briefly with him the
PM's call.

He also said he thought the Ashraf MOU was a good development and said they would need our help to implement it,
which I assured him he had. I pointed out our statement which I am sending to him.

I also urged him to urge the PM to call Nujaifi, pointing out that this was a Sunday call takeaway. He said he would try
this evening. (Nujaifi has departed for Suleimaniye so we might have comms difficulties.)

On political front, on bad news front, we have Allawi's spokeswoman, always good for raw meat rhetoric, Maysoon, with
the following (She does not necessarily speak for all of Iraqiyya, or even Allawi, but spins everyone up):

Fayyad assured me he would discuss the agreements with the PM tonight and woulf have feedback for me in time for
our 1100 meeting tomorrow.


He also said he thought the Ashraf MOU was a good development and said they would need our help to implement it,
which I assured him he had.



On the political front here is a statement by Allawi's spokeswoman, very fiery, but not necessarily the lraqiyya (or even
Allawi) bottom line:


Maysoun Damluji (Allawi's spokeswoman) gave a press conference yesterday in Amman. Highlights below.


        Iraqiyya has evidence "proving" that Maliki is involved in terrorism, including the assassination of Hadi Mandi,
who was shot in Baghdad on September 8.


        lraqiyya planned to move ahead with a no confidence motion against Maliki because of his unacceptable
behavior. The bloc had been in contact with the National Alliance to find an alternative to Maliki.


        Iraqiyya refuses to replace Hashemi or Mutlaq, who received their positions on the basis of political consensus.


        She called for a committee of political bloc leaders, including representatives from the judiciary, to "review" the
charges against Hashemi. Maliki must reverse his decision to remove Mutlaq from his position.


        Talabani's meeting should focus on establishing real partnership and recommitting to the Erbil Agreements.
