Rick

Per our conversation this morning, I am connecting you with Maureen White,
                                                                                                         Since our
activities in Pakistan are in a challenged place,



You are both on holiday but I thought perhaps you could connect via telephone for a bit and then find time to meet
when you are both back in the office.

(Maureen — Rick has been working with Karin Von Hippel to the framework for the Civilian Security Operations Bureau —
a new bureau identified in the QDDR; we are seeking to have him run the bureau though that information is not public
so welcome your discretion).

If you all could connect and revert I would be grateful.

Best.
