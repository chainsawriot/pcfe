I am truly happy -- my trip to Singapore is the penultimate leg of a 3 week trip abroad that started with Jared Cohen's
Google Ideas summit for violent extremists in Dublin




I have negotiated a deal with The Atlantic where they will feature me as a correspondent with my own website called
"Notes from the Foreign Policy Frontier," which I am defining as "social, digital, and global" --e.g. all the stuff that we
pioneered at State over the past three years. In my course in Barcelona I assigned parts of the Global Development
Policy, the QDDR, and a number of your speeches -- viewed from even a slight distance the amount of change you have
put in motion is remarkable. It truly is a new way of seeing and doing foreign policy. I will send you what I write, which
will incorporate things like my take-aways from the Forum I just attended. I'll also be writing at least monthly for the FT
as part of their "A-list" (I think I'm one of two women on it...) And I've got lots of speeches coming up
                   and a full teaching load.

Your trip sounds like an HRC special! I still think that working out something re Cyprus is the most important global
dispute to resolve after Israel-Palestine -- if Greece were ever going to do a deal that could at least lay the groundwork
for an integrated Turkey-Greece-Cyprus-Israel economic zone (Bob Wexler's idea), now would be the time. Be careful in
HK to try to counter likely Chinese social media efforts to spin your visit as "containing" China by stopping in the
democratic-capitalist outpost rather than in the mainland (I know you went to BJ-SH last year, but this narrative has
plenty of steam, particularly following Indonesia & the continuing South China sea issues. I do worry that w/ Jeff Bader
and Jim gone, w/ Kurt and Dan Russell at the NSC both really being Japan hands, and w/ Bill Burns really being an India-
hand, the strong voices for seeing issues more as at least parts of the Chinese government do are no longer there, which
means you are not getting as full a cross-section of views (even though as you will remember, I was a strong proponent
of your meeting w/ the Dalai Lama). It is true that the Chinese understand toughness and you have to draw lines, but it
is also true that some of what we are doing risks feeding Chinese nationalism and intensifying the security dilemma. Kurt
has an intensely male and military view of the world (tho he is quite brilliant at what he does); having Wendy on board
will help.

Wow--that's high praise indeed since he knows everybody.

How are you? Are you on a longer trip or just back and forth to Singapore? I'm off Thursday for nearly two weeks to
Turkey, Greece, India, Indonesia and Hong Kong. Hope we can catch up in person sometime. Until then, Happy Summer
to you and your family.

I'm in Singapore for a forum on FutureChina and am listening to John Thornton interview to Lee Kwan Yew. Someone
from the audience asked him who the greatest leaders were that he had met in his career, and he answered Deng Xiao
Ping, Helmut Schmidt, and WJC. Nice company!

Congrats on the Mexican truck deal! And making sure the flo/flytilla didn't turn into a disaster.
