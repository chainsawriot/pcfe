Hi Cheryl,

I hope you're well. I'm writing to let you know that                                                                   . It's
been a great experience working at both State and USAID, but I'm looking forward to heading back home. I also wanted
to thank you for being so accommodating to let me transition between State and USAID two years ago, as I've learned a
lot from both experiences. I'll be at USAID until June 15, but if there is anything I can do to be helpful to you or HRC
when I'm back in NY, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Many thanks,
Chris
