Line block questions:

Why is the Julia Roberts interview during the time I have weekly depoartmental meeting?

Also, I don't see a mtg w POTUS on the 1Sth--can we get that scheduled?

I want to have my own pre-brief before the Kissinger event.

And, I notice that the HBO event conflicts w a PC mtg at WH. Now w/Donilon in charge can we get a set time for all the
regular mtgs so we don't schedule conflicting events?

When is Adm Mullen having his small Pakistan dinner? If it's the 21st, can I get back in time from Paris?

If La Raza can pay for a reception for Raul, why is his swearing in ceremony in the Treaty Room instead of the Franklin?
Can't we find a time for them? Also, I won't be able to go to his reception at a hotel since I have to go to the screening
for the Nat Geo special so that day doesn't work so well. What about on the 26th after I get back from NY since Bill will
be in Haiti and could come back to DC?
