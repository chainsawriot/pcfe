I have just received this email on my personal account, which I check much less frequently than my State
account.

I have not received any emails from you on my State account in recent days -- for example, I did not get the
email you sent to me and Feltman on the Egyptian custody case. Something is very wrong with the connection
there. I suppose a near-term fix is to just send messages to this account -- my personal account -- and I will
check it more regularly.




I have a written readout                                       that I will send home tonight for you.

I spoke with Cannon's guy yesterday and told him we'd come back to him Monday or Tuesday. I'll have CDM
follow up with Rangel and then take it from there.

 I'm never sure which of my emails you receive so pls let me know if you receive this one and on which
 adddress you did.

 Petraeus told me he had given Gates what he wanted from Canada. Will you or Cheryl pls check w Rangel so
 we can pass onto Cannon?

 Did you get the email I sent to you and Feltmann about the Egyptian custody case?

 I am supposed to talk w Blair             this am. What happened at the mtg on Friday? Anything else I need to
 know before the calls?
