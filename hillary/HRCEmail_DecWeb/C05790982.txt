FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Machinists Union Endorses President Obama for Second Term
Washington, D.C., February 24, 2012 - In a unanimous vote, the Machinists Non-Partisan Political League
(MNPL) endorsed the reelection of President Barack Obama.

"Jobs are the central issue of this campaign, and only President Obama has a plan that would put millions of
Americans and thousands of Machinists back to work," said IAM International President Tom Buffenbarger.
"We're convinced the job growth we're now seeing, particularly in the critical manufacturing sector, is a direct
result of President Obama's policies and leadership and we want that growth to continue."

The endorsement follows a recommendation from members of the union's National Planning Committee, the
governing body of the Machinists Non-Partisan Political League (MNPL). Formed in 1947, the MNPL
evaluates candidates for IAM members and makes recommendations at the state and national level.

"Our policy differences with the White House in the past have dealt with the pace and speed of this recovery.
IAM members recognize that GOP presidential candidates and Republican Congressional leaders have placed
obstacle after obstacle in President Obama's path. We intend to work overtime to remove those obstacles,"
promised Buffenbarger.

With nearly 700,000 members, the IAM is among the nation's most politically active labor unions and the
endorsement sets the stage for significant volunteer activity by IAM members . on behalf of President Obama.
