  NOTE FOR THE SECRETARY

  FROM:         S/CIEA Pascual and S/EEE Morningstar

  SUBJECT: Iraq Energy Engagement Strategy

         Given recent discussions of Iraq and oil                  we would like to
  update you on the steps we are taking on this issue. Iraq is potentially one of the
  largest oil producers in the world, but one where production has consistently
  underperformed expectations and significant challenges remain. First, Embassy
  Baghdad, NEA, ENR, and S/EEE will analyze the principal constraints on
  expanding Iraq's oil output and develop a set of targets to help move the country in
  the right direction. Second, we will craft a diplomatic strategy to keep Iraqi
  policymakers consistently focused on the projects and initiatives most likely to pay
  the greatest dividends. By bringing together one State team to work these issues,
  we believe we can add dynamism


  Lack of export infrastructure remains the principle impediment to short-term
  growth in Iraqi oil exports. Oil contracts with international companies signed in
  2009 are now raising production. Our goal, with the embassy, is to try to keep Iraq
  on the critical path of bringing new infrastructure on line while addressing the list
  of commercial and policy issues that constrain production and exports. We will
  develop a systematic and targeted approach that sets realistic goals and identifies
  concrete steps for engagement and assistance. Iraq has the capacity to increase
  sustainable production from the current 2.6 million barrels per day (bpd) up to four
  million bpd of oil in the next five years, but it has to take the necessary and
  sufficient steps to get there. By tracking each step and engaging Iraq to stay on this
  path, we stand the best chance to use our diplomatic capital and commercial
  leverage most effectively.
