I had no idea she was having this delay. By the time she gets here, the Summit will be over. Can she help us on
other projects afterwards?

                   still has not cleared L/Ethics.
                                                                                                                  B5




                   already has her DS clearance, ID badge and email address. So we are ready to go as             B6
         soon as they clear her.                                                                                  B5




         Katy/Rich are aware this is a priority for us to move, but having difficulty getting the General
         Counsel to respond. I have reached out to              to make sure she is aware of hold up and          B6
         can help push this.                                                                                      B5

 L/Ethics is still reviewing. They are aiming to have the clearance completed end of this
 week/early next week, but understand her form is complicated and L did not have the position
 description to review it against until last week.



 In the meantime,          is coming in for a security briefing on Wednesday and asked if she
 could get any briefing materials to bring her up to speed. I reached out to Kamala on this.
