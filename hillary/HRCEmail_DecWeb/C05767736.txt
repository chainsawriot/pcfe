Cheryl - could you pass this note to the Secretary for me? Thank you. Carlos

Madam Secretary,

Patricia Espinosa will likely see you in Montevideo and mention your trip to Mexico on March 23. One of her concerns is
to make sure that other cabinet members who belong to the High-Level Group on security issues also participate. On our
side the other two key players are Secretaries Napolitano and Gates. Espinosa will try to make sure their counterparts
are there. It would be helpful if you could call Napolitano and Gates and encourage them to come. Napolitano's role on
Juarez and the border is especially critical.

I am on the way back to Mexico City from El Paso following the de-brief from an intensive week-long planning session
that involved all key US and Mexican security agencies. We have a strong plan. Calderon now needs to make important
decisions on command and control, force deployments, and prosecutorial capacity. We are still working on the
socioeconomic plan. They can turn the violence around, but they will need to be resolute and clear about responsibilities
and authorities. It would be helpful if you could tell Espinosa that you are aware of the plan and affirm the importance
of establishing a unified command structure for the security operations in Juarez.

Carlos
