Pls be sure Graham knows I'm game even if McConnell decides not to invite. Maybe Jim S could call him to discuss. And
I'll be glad to call Mullen aitho don't think it's necessary.

Adams is working with McConnell's staff on it. They aren't as excited as Graham. It'll play out overnight, and we'll know
for sure in the morning. Steinberg is game. If he does it, he'd like you to call Mullen to see if they can send a military
rep with him (not critical, but his recommendation).
