It was great to hear your voice, but I was frustrated with myself for not having turned on the cell ringer after a
meeting, so missed you. I will watch it like a hawk, so pls try whenever convenient for you. Mobile should
reach me anywhere.




I am enjoying engaging with State on the Summit on Impact Investing being organized by Kris B.'s team, led by
an outstanding young AID Foreign Service Officer, Lala Faiz. A small planning session 1/20 has maxed at 70,
with key private sector, government and ngos nationwide clamoring to get in. Assetmark founder Ron Cordes,
who sold his firm to Genentech and now is dedicated fulltime to advancing impact investing (CGI commitment
2010), young California venture capitalist and prof Sean Foote and I are Lala's "kitchen cabinet". Very exciting
and good, even at a distance, to be working to further your goals.

Your internal message to the State team beginning 2011 was inspirational -- so right to start with Amb
Holbrooke. What a loss and a tragedy. To see in print the scope of your travel in 2010 alone was staggering. I
really, really hope you can address the Skoll World Forum in Oxford end of March this year. The social

entrepreneurs Skoll convenes and supports are truly the "foot soldiers" for building economies that work for all,
and that create the kind of opportunity that engenders stability and peace. You'd love the energy and the
inspiration of the Skoll convening. Jeff Skoll is making this his life's work.

I mourn the dissolution of ShoreBank, but the two banks continue to operate under new ownership as mission-
focused CDFIs, and the affiliates spun out as independent entities. Most of them continue strong. ShoreBank
International, where I am now full-time, is in final stages of switching out SBK holding company ownership
with new investors. The first investor will internationalize our ownership in tremendously positive way. SBI
CEO & President Laurie Spengler is a star who reminds me of you, and it's gratifying to be part of building her
top management team.

I truly hope 2011 is opening in great health, happiness and some balance (!) for you and Bill and all the family.
