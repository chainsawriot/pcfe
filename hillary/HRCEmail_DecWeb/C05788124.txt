I talked to General Al Assar, emphasizing, which he knew, that Sam's father was the Secretary of Transportation. "Our
friend," said General al Assar and "a very nice man...." He doesn't think he can get to the judge until tomorrow
morning. They get it. General Wolf is here, too, and has meetings with Tantawi, Sami Annan, and al Assar tomorrow
(three separate meetings.)

Anne - LaHood just reached S and she told him you were working it. She said he's obviously anxious but knows we're on
it. I told her we'd keep her posted.

No, no other background. We found out this problem through a fluke really, involving an apparent case of mistaken
identity when a teacher at the American school was prohibited from leaving Egypt last night. Our consular people went
to the Ministry of Justice with her, ran into the IRI lawyer, who talked to the judge, who said he had put some people on
the no fly list. It isn't clear who/ how many are on the list . We were in touch with the Deputy Minister at the MFA
today about this, but obviously they didn't, or couldn't, do anything. We were told that IRI had someone leaving on
vacation, but we didn't know Sam himself was departing. Lorne got in touch with me directly when he heard about
Sam.

 I am sure that Secretary LaHood is worried about his son. Sam is back at his apartment. We are trying to get our
 friends in the SCAF right now and believe we can find out tomorrow if Julie and other principals are on the list.

Let's see if we can resolve it ourselves today/tomorrow. If not, we will bring in the heavy guns. Tomorrow, we need
to find out who else is on the list.

Subject: Heads up on call


Secretary LaHood may be calling                about his son, Sam, who was prohibited from leaving on his flight
tonight. Apparently, he is on the exit control list, and there may be others. I think we have a decent chance of
resolving this tomorrow if we can keep it out of the press. We got hints earlier in the day that there might be
restrictions on departing the country and had talked to the Foreign Ministry about it.

Lorne told me that Secretary LaHood had some ideas, and Lorne had urged him to call
