Damascus SitRep 10/17/2011


(SBU) Yesterday (10/16/2011) state-run newspaper Al-Thawra printed a front page article stating: "Ford was in charge of
death squads in Iraq and is trying to apply his experience in Syria." The article claims, falsely, that Ambassador Ford was
responsible for death squads organized by the Salvadoran government in Iraq some years ago, when Ford served under
then Ambassador John Negroponte. The Al-Thawra article goes on to make the ludicrous claim that Ambassador Ford
"started applying the experience he gained in Iraq in Syria," citing the death of 130 SARG security officers in Jisr al-
Shughour shortly after the Ambassador's visit to the embattled city of Hama. RSO Damascus is concerned that such
flagrant misinformation on the front page of a state-run newspaper is tantamount to incitement and may result in even
greater anti-American sentiment and attacks directed at the Ambassador.

(U) In a press conference held on Saturday (10/15/2011), Qadri Jamil, a member of The Popular Front for Change and
Liberation in Syria, denied that his organization had any contact with the U.S. Ambassador to Syria, saying: "contacting

the enemy is a national betrayal." Jamil urged the Syrian government to expel Ambassador Ford, claiming that Ford has:
"encroached upon all diplomatic norms." RSO Damascus notes that this is yet another instance of mounting anti-
American sentiment directed at Ambassador Ford.


(U) Tonight marks the third and final night of condolences for Mohammad Ibrahim Shayban, a young child that was
killed by SARG forces during last Friday's demonstrations in the Damascus neighborhood of Midan. The funeral and
condolence ceremonies have drawn large crowds and resulted in clashes with SARG security forces.


(U) The Syrian economy has been deteriorating since the beginning of the unrest in March. However, one opposition
website claims that: "prices for electrical appliances went up by 30%, furniture by 50%, clothing by 30%, autos by 30%.
What makes it worse is the accompanying rise in food/agricultural products and basic materials, as prices for canned
food went up by 20%, fish by 60%, cooking oil by 20%, dairy products by 20%, and baby milk by 10%. The economic
conditions continue to worsen despite Assad government's overturn of the import suspension ruling which only
contributed to negative market speculations." RSO Damascus notes that it is likely for crime in Syria to increase as the
economy continues its downward spiral.


(U) The embassy's Main CAC, which was closed due to damage sustained during the July 11 attack against the embassy,
was re-opened today.


(U) TDY ARSO Nadim Abdus-Shahid departed post yesterday, en-route back to Amman. RSO Damascus is now at
minimal staffing with RSO and one ARSO.


(SBU) Both RSO Damascus and the MSG Detachment remain on a heightened security status.
