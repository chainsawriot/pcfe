 Poll: Afghanistan turns from Taliban
 By: Tim Mak       â€¢
 November 15, 2011 12:02 PM EST

 In what could be a welcome development for U.S. policy makers, a new survey in Afghanistan
 shows that support for the Taliban has dramatically declined over the last two years.

 The percentage of respondents who say they sympathize with the Taliban has dropped to 29
 percent, compared with 56 percent in 2009 and 40 percent last year, according to a poll by the
 Asia Foundation, a San Francisco-based NGO. The poll was partly funded by the U.S. Agency for
 International Development.

 This low level of approval for the Taliban is coupled with a high level of support for the
 government's reconciliation and negotiation efforts with armed opposition groups. In fact, 82
 percent of Afghans prefer a political settlement.

 The survey found that self-reported economic conditions are improving, as the percentage that
 reported financial well-being jumped from 31 percent in 2009 to 43 percent in 2011, the poll
 showed.

Meanwhile, there is slight optimism for the future of the country. This year, nearly half of the
respondents, 46 percent say that the country is moving in the right direction. The majority of
respondents report satisfaction with basic needs, such as education for children (73 percent),
clean drinking water (70 percent) and the availability of clinics and hospitals (57 percent).

However, this is to be contrasted by the fact that 35 percent of Afghans think the country is moving
in the wrong direction, an increase of 8 percent since 2010. Insecurity due to attacks, violence and
terrorism is identified as the biggest problem in Afghanistan (38 percent), followed by
unemployment (23 percent) and corruption (21 percent).

The survey took place between July 2 and August 11, and involved face-to-face interviews with
6,348 Afghan citizens across all 34 provinces.
