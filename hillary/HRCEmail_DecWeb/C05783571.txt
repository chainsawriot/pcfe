Subject: Calls on Arab League mtg

I've been in touch with many of the participants in today's Arab League meeting. I'll attempt to summarize here. There
is a real sense of accomplishment among those with whom I spoke, a feeling that they showed the AL can be relevant
and respond to an Arab crisis and Arab public opinion. As one told me, "we exceeded expectations.". They all seem
tired, too, at what sounds to be an exhausting and rather historic debate Syria, unlike Libya, is a heavyweight in Arab
politics. Remarkable that the AL followed through. That said, this giddiness shouldn't disguise the fact that there's not
much in the way of implementation beyond the suspension of Syria's participation in AL bodies.

The FMs seem to agree that there were three primary accomplishments (and I'm not quoting the communique here but
what they saw as significant):

-- agreement to suspend the participation of Syria from all AL bodies, starting November 16. The suspension lasts until
the SARG fully implements the AL initiative. (More below on this date.)

-- agreement that AL SecGen al-Araby would work on plans to protect civilians, including by looking at how to
cooperate with Arab and international human rights groups (again, more below). He is expected to present ideas for the
11/16 meeting in Rabat.

-- call on Arab states to withdraw ambassadors from Damascus, although with a caveat that such decisions are the
sovereign right of each state.

According to what I heard, the sanctions language was more or less a place holder reference. There is nothing in the
language to implement this. The Arabs will discuss this again when they meet on 11/16 in Rabat, but I didn't get theB1
sense that they expect to implement formal sanctions. Still, the mention of sanctions is useful.                    1.4(B)
