I want to thank you for your interest in 2013 Chief of Mission positions in EAP. You were a highly
qualified candidate, and EAP is honored that you would consider serving as a Chief of Mission in our
region. A great number of people expressed interest in our seven COM positions this year, and we
could only nominate a few candidates for each position. Consequently, EAP was not able to nominate
you. We wish you success with any other nominations that you are pursuing and encourage you to
consider EAP again in the future.

Sincerely,

Joe
