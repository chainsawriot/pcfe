The first call should be secure if possible but not necessary for 2d. I'd like to be done w both calls no later than noon.

Roger.

Query whether this call needs to be a secure call? That will likely be difficult for many on a Sunday.

I would propose that the following items be on the agenda for the call tomorrow:

When you say don't forget Mitchell and team - you mean for first call or second?

I can do anytime in morning starting at 7 or 8am and before 12 and would prefer earlier but will do whenever it's
convenient. Also, don't forget Mitchell and team.

Fyi, see below.

Also, what is a good time to set con calls?

My thought is                                    and then one with the whole crew. Perhaps late morning?
