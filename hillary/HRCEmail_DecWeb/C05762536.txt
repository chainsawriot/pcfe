Well, I wish for nothing more than for a speedy recovery for you! Since you are the strongest person on the
planet, I'm sure you are mastering this ordeal relatively easily, but I hope you'll get some real rest this July 4th.'

On health care, we're all hanging on the whims of Finance.

                                                                                                        They got R's
but then some Dems went apoplectic. So now they're trying to build back their package and still attract some
Rs. The problem is that the conservative Dems on the Committee are really just not that helpful. So we're kind
of waiting as this maneuvers because Baucus is keeping us pretty arms length. However, if they don't move in
the next week or so, then there will be no way we're off the Senate floor by August recess. And I worry that if
we start blowing deadlines, and this goes into fall, we'll lose all ability to get this done. (And of course, I would
really like this to be over!) The Senate moderates are just not so into this. What we have going for us is that
they feel like they can't oppose the President on both health care and energy - at least for now.

The other big problem is that the Brooks column from the other day is totally spot on - Rahm will take almost
any deal that comes his way to declare victory. People know that. So there's very little backstop, and that's part
of why Finance is doing what it's doing. But at this point, we need Senate Finance to just move.

The good news is that the Kennedy bill has been scored by CBO as much cheaper - will be $600 billion without
policies for under 150% of poverty and with those policies, will be close to a trillion.

Again, hope you have a great 4th. Miss you Hillary.

Thx for your good wishes as I continue doing research on the health care system for you.


What happening on the Hill? Hope it's going well and that you'll enjoy a splendid July 4th which will provide the only
fireworks over DC.

Well, in the history of this short-lived health care experience so far, Kennedy and the CBO score have definitely been a
nadir. Let's hope it moves up from there.

But more importantly, I hope you are feeling ok! Knowing you, you're probably working harder than ever. Please take
care of yourself.

CBO's score of his partial proposal is killing us - $1 trillion for 16 million people. They have not listened at all, and gone
off to do this in semi-secret - and we're all paying the consequences. But apparently, they know better than
everyone. And then when we distance ourselves from their plan, they are outraged. Sorry for the whining, it's just very
frustrating.
