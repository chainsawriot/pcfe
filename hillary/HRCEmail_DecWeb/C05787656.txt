Suanne:

Good speaking with you earlier.

Per our conversation, I am writing to see if Mr. Nathanson would be interested in serving as one of Secretary Clinton's
appointees to the Board of Directors for the East-West Center.

The East-West Center, based in Honolulu, promotes better relations and understanding among the people and nations
of the U.S., Asia, and the Pacific through cooperative study, research, and dialogue. The 18 member board includes five
members appointed by the Secretary of State, five appointed by the Governor of Hawaii, three ex-officio members, and
five international members chosen by the Board itself. The Secretary's appointees serve for a three year term.

The Board meets twice per year in Honolulu, with several subcommittees on various initiatives.

Below is the link to the Center's website with further information. I also attached a document outlining responsibilities
of Board members.

Let me know if Mr. Nathanson would be interested in this opportunity or if there is any further information I can provide
you or him regarding the Board or the appointment.

Many thanks.
Heather
