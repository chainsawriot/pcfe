No doubt timed to Ahmadenijad announcement today. Have previously scheduled E3+1 call at 10am this morning so will
send any further updates. Need to factor in as needed to ongoing discussion.

Dear colleagues,

We have just received the long-awaited reply from Mr. Jalili (copy is attached).
Upon his request from yesterday, I will have a phone contact with Mr. Bagheri today, where I will possibly get additional
information on the Iranian position.
I will come back to you after my call with Mr. Bagheri in order to see how we can best proceed.

Helga
