FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 27, 2012

                                        Statement by    the Press Secretary

The President welcomes today's news that TransCanada plans to build a pipeline to bring crude oil
from Cushing, Oklahoma, to the Gulf of Mexico. As the President made clear in January, we support
the company's interest in proceeding with this project, which will help address the bottleneck of oil in
Cushing that has resulted in large part from increased domestic oil production, currently at an eight
year high. Moving oil from the Midwest to the world-class, state-of-the-art refineries on the Gulf
Coast will modernize our infrastructure, create jobs, and encourage American energy production. We
look forward to working with TransCanada to ensure that it is built in a safe, responsible and timely
manner, and we commit to take every step possible to expedite the necessary Federal permits.

Separately, TransCanada gave the State Department advance notice of its intention to submit a new
application for the cross-border segment of the Keystone XL pipeline, from Canada to Steele City,
Nebraska, once a route through Nebraska has been identified. House Republicans forced a rejection
of the company's earlier application in January, by not allowing sufficient time for important review
or even the identification of a complete pipeline route. But as we made clear, the President's decision
in January in no way prejudged future applications. We will ensure any project receives the
important assessment it deserves, and will base a decision to provide a permit on the completion of
that review.
