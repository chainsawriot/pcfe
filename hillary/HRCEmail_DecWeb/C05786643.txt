Subject: Global Fund Up-Date

As a follow-up to Eric's memo to you last week, we wanted to let you know that the IG Reports will be going to the
Global Fund Board tomorrow and will be made public on Monday. We have had input on the external tps. The Fund's
Board Chair and IG will brief the AP and Bloomberg on Monday. I have sent placeholder language to Josh for the S
speech in case this becomes a big press issue a week before S delivers her speech.
Please let us know if you need any further information. Thanks
