Paul Charron is still interested in joining you in some capacity.
On an advicnry level Beth Brooke raised the idea of putting together an informal business advisory group of global
women's economic empowerment and related issues, which I think is a good idea. Have to check on the FACA rules.

Subject. Checking in

Dear Margaret.

   .orr; chs.cking n from New York City; the xilter of the uniwrse. I wanted to see whether anything was up on
          1'3              Cortvf_Tiatiori.sâ€ž

It sednis that            Obama is having a lot of difficulty getting business people involved in his various
initiatives. At least that is the sense I get from reading the papers. I know that Hillary is well connected to a
nuniber tit UUSIlIeSS people bui. haven' seen many of them show up in any kind of supporting roles.

I have plenty to do, but it certainly seems that my background and experience could be helpful in some
capacity. reii:;:ase let me know wr.at you are seeing.

Thanks.

Paul
