SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED


Age Discrimination Lawsuit


    •   Cheryl asked Harold for more details on the reported age discrimination lawsuit filed by a Foreign Service Officer
        against the Department.

Embassy Security

    •   Eric Boswell, representing Pat, reviewed two embassy security issues --




Japanese Assistance to Afghanistan and Pakistan

   •    Jim noted that the Secretary is scheduled to meet with the Japanese FM this afternoon and thought this would
        be an opportunity, if we wanted, to make recommendations regarding the major planned expansion in Japanese
        assistance to Afghanistan/Pakistan.

   •     Mike Polt noted that Bill Burns and Dennis Ross had held a series of meetings on the Hill last week on Iran
         sanctions. Bill will also follow up with a call to Senator Dodd. That said, there are three different "streams" of
         possible Iran sanctions that we will likely face in October.

   •     H is still hoping the Secretary will be able to call Senator Leahy to flag the issue of funding for Pakistan FMF and
         Mexico.

   •     Jack noted he had spoken to Congressman Obey about funding for Palau. Obey said he is sympathetic and
         apparently Palau will be made whole in the end, but he noted he could not pass a Continuing Resolution if the
         Republicans believe we are paying Palau to accept detainees.

   •     Jim said he will call Senator DeMint regarding his holds on Valenzuela and Shannon.

Assistant Secretaries Meeting

UNESCO

   •     The fourth round of voting for a new UNESCO head takes place today and the fifth and final tomorrow. Only
         two candidates remain — Hosni and Bokova of Bulgaria. The Europeans are supporting Bokova and 10 believes at
         least three Latin American votes are still up for grabs and they intend to work with WHA to reach out to those
         countries. (10 assured me afterwards that everything will be coordinated with NEA.)

H1N1

    •    Maria Otero noted that the President had announced that 10 percent of our vaccine will be shared with the rest
         of the world.

Cuba

    •    WHA noted that the just concluded first round of postal talks with Cuba had gone well. They also noted we
         would be denying a visa to Alarcon, the head of the National Assembly, to attend UNGA. (I asked WHA to send a
         note to S on this, since it will attract attention.)
