Subject: (AP) Clinton says Pakistan missed chances with al-Qaida

ISLAMABAD (AP) - U.S. Secretary of State Clinton is suggesting that Pakistan's government has squandered chances to
kill or capture al-Qaida leaders. She made the remark in an interview with Pakistani journalists during a trip to the city
of Lahore. She said she finds it hard to believe that nobody in Pakistan's government knows where the leaders of Osama
bin Laden's terrorist network are hiding.
