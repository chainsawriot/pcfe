                    USGLC Applauds Choice of Dr. Rajiv Shah as USAID Administrator
                In Choosing Dr. Shah, President Signals Important Role Development Plays in Foreign Policy

Washington, DC â€” The U.S. Global Leadership Coalition released the following statement from Executive Director Liz
Schrayer on President Obama's announcement of Dr. Rajiv Shah to be Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International
Development:

`The USGLC applauds the President's nomination of Dr. Rajiv Shah to be USAID Administrator as yet another example of
the President's commitment to elevating our civilian-led, smart power tools. With a robust International Affairs Budget
request for FY 2010, a pledge to double foreign assistance by 2015, a Presidential Study Directive on Global Development
and the State Department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, the Administration continues to demonstrate
the essential role development and diplomacy play in our foreign policy.

"Rajiv Shah is a fresh and dynamic addition to President Obama's foreign policy team. Dr. Shah will bring expertise and
energy to a critical agency in need of strong, empowered leadership. His career in global development, global health and
agricultural development give him real perspective to lead USAID. He is already an important player in the Administration's
food security initiative, and his additional background in fighting global poverty and promoting global health make him an
ideal candidate for this important post.

"The USGLC's broad, bipartisan coalition welcomes Dr. Shah's nomination to be USAID Administrator, and we look forward
to working with him to strengthen the role of development"
