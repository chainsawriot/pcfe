Congressman Berman called me yesterday in support of Bob King's candidacy to serve as Special Envoy for Human Rights
in North Korea. I know he has raised this with Rich too.

I've known Bob for a number of years, throughout his tenure on Tom Lantos' staff, and have high regard for him.

Enjoy the weekend,

Bill.
