Subject: if S asks about Libya

I talked to the Libyan Foreign Minister, Musa Kusa, today. He clearly "gets it." He said that Megrahi would
NOT appear on the September 1 revolution day festivities (40th anniversary of the "green revolution"). And
he said that he totally understood that Qadhafi should stay in New York and not set up a tent in New
Jersey. At the same time, others from the MFA called in our Embassy in Tripoli and called in the UK
ambassador. The Libyans are clearly looking for a way out of the self-inflicted mess. Let's hope that these
wiser heads can prevail on Qadhafi.

We've double-tracked with the (very good and long-suffering) Libyan Ambassador here.
