   I am forwarding a few pictures I have received in the, past few days. I would
   hope that you fonward these. to your contact vvithin the DOS. I .suspedt you have
   many if not all of these pictures, but I want to identify specific individuals in the
   AGNA leadership that are present in these photos. As I mentioned tollIBLEL
   yesterday, I am Convinced the greatest threat to the security of the Embassy is

   The failure of                                         to protect those they have

   those who remain to make the same offenses against this guard forde. In
   addition., these photos as many were made public on Facebook and traded
   amongst the guard force should be used in promotion boards so that future
   leadership of this contract can be assured of the character of its leaders,

   Respectfully,



   ps.. last night the AGNA leadership                                       we .
