Subject: Haiti: PM Concerns & Mexico Assistance Conference

Cheryl, Meghann,

Below is some intel David got on the Mexico conference David picked up from the Mexicans here. The conference's
timing would be extremely awkward if things proceed as Guy Noel suggests:

Guy reports that "they" have decided to go forward with:
1)October 29th Interpellation (Impeachment) of the PM
2) Oct. 31St the president will add the ratification of the new PM on the existing list of the LOWER HOUSE activities
(which Guy asserts is illegal)
3) November 3rd Nomination of the new PM
4) Then the ratification of the PM

You can bet that the PM will repeat all this verbatim to George Soros when she sees him today. Not sure what - if
anything - that will provoke.

              got this information too and has a pre-scheduled meeting with Preval today. I understand he plans on
raising this. We'll let you know what we hear.

In my Tuesday lunch with Gabriel I mentioned in very clear terms our concern about any sort of turmoil in government
reflecting very badly on the international community's efforts to tout Haiti as stable and open for investment. He said
he understood. He said, "I don't see Michelle (Pierre-Louis) going anywhere soon." He conceded that while Preval did
have a majority in Parliament, he could not control all parliamentarians on all issues.

We'll try and get in to see someone from the Senate in the coming days.

This is why a call would be most useful.

KM

Subject: Mexico conference on Haiti

I had dinner last night with Mexican DCM Alan Romero and asked about the November 5-6 conference on Haiti
sponsored by the GOM. He told me that they had originally hoped it could be a forum for a broad discussion on the

international community's engagement with Haiti (both political and assistance), but that it has morphed into a donor's
meeting to discuss coordination of assistance. Originally they planned to invite Foreign Ministers, but now they are
inviting the heads of assistance agencies. Preval was originally to attend, but he has decided to send his Foreign
Minister and the Minister of Planning. Romero indicated that the GOM has not received the number and caliber of
confirmations of attendance that they had hoped for. I asked Romero what outcome the GOM would like to see from
the meeting, and he said that they want to encourage donors to coordinate more with the GOH and among themselves.

The GOM hosted an "experts" meeting on Haiti two weeks ago where a number of individuals long involved in Haiti
presented position papers on the political, economic and assistance challenges in Haiti. He said that a common theme
of the papers was the need for greater donor coordination. He will send me a set of the position papers. Mexico is not a
donor to Haiti.
