Subject: fourth speechwriter update

FYI:

I have now seriously reviewed 9 candidates (and explored a handful of others who, for various reasons, I didn't feel
would be what we were looking for). Two have acceted other jobs that were already on the table before I spoke to
them (and for which they were better suited). One (         who I love) has decided her legal future requires her to come
here in a capacity other than speechwriting, and I think she's right about that



None of these candidates is over 32 years old. The best writer among them is the youngest â€” 24. She is intellectually
extremely mature and the only professional writer in the group.

                                                                                                   On the other hand,
she's extremely smart and an excellent writer.

I have two more candidates who are working on second rounds of mock speeches. I need to see how quickly and
effectively they grasp directions and feedback. Hopefully one of them will work out for us.

One other prospect materialized yesterday; am waiting to get a better feel for her suitability. I'm also re-mining
journalistic contacts to see if I can possibly find a more seasoned writer from a newspaper or magazine who wants to
make the switch to government. So far that has proven futile; the few journalists who I've reached out to were not
interested in coming.

Will keep you posted.
