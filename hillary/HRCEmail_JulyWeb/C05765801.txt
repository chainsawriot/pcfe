I appreciate being included in the dialogue last evening. I now have a much better appreciation for the challenges, as
well as the pressures you and the Secretary address each day. While I suspect there is not much that those of us on the
"outside" can do to help, call on me at any time if I can assist in any fashion. Not to be too dramatic about it but the
Secretary's success is in the country's interests. Reference was made last night to more rest for HRC-I have to believe
that with the rigors of your job a little R+R for you is in order-hopefully you can work out some personal time over the
holiday period.
By the way, can you give me an email for Capricia Marshall?
All the best and do call if there is anything I can do.
