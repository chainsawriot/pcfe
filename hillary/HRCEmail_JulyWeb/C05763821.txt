3 militants die on eve of Afghan presidential vote
KABUL (AP) Police stormed a bank in Kabul on Wednesday and killed three insurgents who had taken it over, while a
wave of attacks killed at least six election workers around the country on the eve of the presidential election, officials
said. The three-man assault in Kabul came a day after two militant attacks in the capital, including rockets fired at the
presidential palace. It also follows a suicide car bomb explosion in front of NATO's Kabul headquarters Saturday that
killed seven, a drumbeat of attacks that would appear to signal the intent of Taliban insurgents and their militant allies
to disrupt Thursday's vote. In a sign of how difficult election preparations have been, Afghanistan's chief electoral
officer said that 20 percent of election materials hadn't yet been delivered to voting sites less than 24 hours before polls
open at 7 a.m. Thursday (0230 GMT Thursday, 10:30 p.m. EDT Wednesday). Daoud Ali Najafi said Afghan army
helicopters would be used to,deliver the materials to insecure and hard-to-reach regions.
