                                    TBD

 Purpose of Call: To obtain the Government of Argentina's recognition of
 Honduras' November 29 elections and to request that Argentina support a
 "politically binding" agreement in Copenhagen.

 • Iran: We appreciate your principled support on the IAEA Board of Governors
   resolution on Iran. A strong, unified signal to Iran is vital as we continue to
   move forward. We hope Argentina will also join us in combating the shared
   global threat of nuclear terrorism and help advance nuclear security-related
   efforts, such as the planning underway for President Obama's upcoming Global
   Nuclear Security Summit and the longstanding nuclear security related work in
   the IAEA.

  • Honduras: We believe strongly in the need to send a decisive signal about the
    return of democratic and constitutional order in the wake of the June 28 coup
    d'etat.                     Classified by DAS, A/GIS, DoS on 07/30/2015 — Class: CONFIDENTIAL
                                     — Reason: 1.4(B), 1.4(D), B1 — Declassify on: 11/27/2024

  • We all agree that military coups must remain part of our past. We have
    remained firm on that principle and have acted upon our convictions through
    aid cutoffs and visa revocations.

  • We also believe that we must work to help Honduras move forward to restore
    democratic and constitutional order. That is why we got involved to help
    broker the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Agreement. We are working hard to help the
    parties implement that agreement, including the December 2 congressional
    deliberations on the matter of President Zelaya's restitution.

  • Elections are a vital part of the overall solution. The Honduran elections follow
    the normal calendar established by the constitution. They got underway long
    before the coup and involve candidates from a wide array of parties and
    ideologies. The elections are being run not by the de facto regime, but by the
    Supreme Electoral Tribunal, which was itself chosen before the coup.

  • We see the elections and the implementation of the Accord as part of a package.
    I encourage you to also view the elections as a vital part of the democratic way
    forward and to support the people of Honduras and their newly elected

     government as they move forward to restore Honduras to a functioning
     democracy as quickly as possible.

  • [If Raised: Zelaya must be returned to office for elections to be legitimate]:
    The Accord called for the Congress to vote on his restitution expeditiously, and
    we urge them to do that. It is critical that Honduras forge a government of
    national unity before transferring power to the next president.

  • [If Raised: November 26 Supreme Court opinion on President Zelaya's
    restitution]: The Supreme Court's opinion on President Zelaya's restitution is
    a separate matter and has no relationship to the holding of elections. Elections
    are a vital part of the solution and completely separate from the issue of
    President Zelaya's restitution, as laid out in the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord
    which President Zelaya signed.

  • Copenhagen Accord on Climate Change: The White House just announced
    that, in the context of an overall deal in Copenhagen, the President is prepared
    to put forward a U.S. emissions reduction target in the range of 17 percent
    below 2005 levels in 2020. These targets represent levels 18 percent below
    1990 by 2025 and 33 percent below 1990 by 2030, in line with final U.S.
    legislation.

  • A successful outcome in Copenhagen is critical. Danish Prime Minister Lars
    Rasmussen has proposed a "politically binding" operational agreement that
    would cover all the main issues. We support this proposal, and hope you will,
    too. It is not a substitute for a legal agreement, but will advance such an
    agreement.

  • All countries, from the most vulnerable to those with greater capacity, would
    benefit from getting started with a good deal that sets us on a path to avoid the
    worst dangers of climate change, and provides new financing opportunities.

  • Success will require positive engagement by all. Argentina can make a real
    difference exercising positive leadership and supporting the Danish proposal.

  • I understand Argentina has concerns about potential trade impacts. We are
    working to ensure our climate policy will be consistent with our international
    trade obligations under the World Trade Organization. Also, any border tax

     would likely not be focused on agricultural exports, but rather energy intensive
     exports.

  Background: Honduras -- Argentina has been a strong supporter of President
  Zelaya since his ouster on June 28. In the OAS and elsewhere, the Argentine
  government has maintained that Zelaya must be restored to office for the
  November 29 elections to be legitimate and the victor to be recognized by the
  international community as the duly elected President.

  The Honduran Supreme Court issued an opinion November 26 on President
  Zelaya's restoration to office, as requested by the Honduran Congress in
  accordance with the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord. The opinion recommends
  against Zelaya's restoration because he has criminal charges pending against him.

                                                                               told
  Embassy Buenos Aires that Argentines believe they and other Latins have invested
  much in restoring democracy to Honduras but have (rotten nowhere ue to
  Micheletti's duplicity.                                                   lose to
  Taiana and President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, said the Argentine
  government will stick to the joint communique CFK and Lula signed November 18
  in Brasilia, i.e., that Argentina and Brazil will not recognize the results of elections
  held by a de facto government. In the communiqué, CFK and Lula said Zelaya's
  restitution was "indispensable for the re-establishment of constitutional order, rule
  of law, and democratic life in Honduras."                        comments track
  closely with what CFK said to the Ambassador November 13.
