I am still with the Israeli delegation and am waiting for the moment they hear this. The press release does not even say
this was at Ocampo's request.

ICC Prosecutor receives Palestinian Minister of Justice, Arab League and Independent Fact-
Finding Committee
ICC-OTP-20091016-PR465

On 16 October, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Luis Moreno-Ocampo, received a
Palestinian delegation headed by Dr. Ali Khashan, Minister of Justice of the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA). Dr. Khashan was accompanied by the Palestinian Ambassador to the Netherlands, Nabil Abuznaid, and
a team of legal experts including Vaughan Lowe QC, Professor of International Law at Oxford University. The
Prosecutor also received members of the Independent Fact-finding Committee led by Professor John Dugard
and members of the Arab League Secretariat, in the context of ongoing consultations.

The PNA delegation submitted a preliminary report presenting its legal arguments in support of the declaration
lodged on 22 January 2009, accepting the jurisdiction of the Court over crimes committed in Palestine. The Office
will carefully examine all supporting arguments submitted, starting with the initial issue of whether the declaration
by the PNA accepting the exercise of jurisdiction by the ICC meets statutory requirements. The Prosecutor said

"We appreciate the efforts undertaken by the PNA and the extensive legal arguments presented on a highly
complex area of law."

A further report is to be presented by the PNA in the near future, clarifying additional issues discussed during the
meeting.

Palestinian delegations previously visited the Court on 22 January and 13 February 2009.
