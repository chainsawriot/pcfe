To All:

Friday evening Hugo and I began picking up from de facto sources that M was about to enter a meeting with supporters
and that some of the hardliners were making yet another attempt to dissuade M from taking a leave of absence. We
immediately phoned contacts close to M and warned that if M reneged, we would launch a massive round of visa
revocations, to include families. A couple hours later, sources began to report that M had decided definitively to step
aside as announced. Former President Maduro played a key role in persuading M to keep his promise.

Later, Panamanian VP/FM Varela called me to say he had heard from his private sector contacts in Honduras that M had
"ratified" the decision to take a leave of absence.

We will stay on top of this until M actually leaves.
