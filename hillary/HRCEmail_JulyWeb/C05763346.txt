Congratulations to you and to President Clinton. The right thing to do and extremely well done. Have spoken with columnists and
editorial writers galore to support effort and the hard work ahead. Might be useful sometime to compare Madeleine and my experience
with KJI and Kang to surface what has changed. Positive that Kang was in room. Travel safely in Africa. Your trip is important since
that continent will loom large into the future.
