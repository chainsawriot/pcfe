KABUL (Reuters) - Partial results issued September 8 for last month's Afghan presidential election gave incumbent
Hamid Karzai 54.1 percent of the vote, the first time he has been shown with enough votes to win in a single round. The
results, announced by the Independent Election Commission with 91.6 percent of polling stations tallied, gave Karzai's
main rival Abdullah Abdullah 28.3 percent of the vote.
