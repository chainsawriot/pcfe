Subject: Tremendous thanks to Secretary Clinton

Dear Secretary Clinton,

It is with great pride and a full heart that I write to thank you for your personal, videotaped message congratulating Gays
and Lesbians in Foreign Affairs Agencies (GLIFAA) on winning this year's "Outie" award for best LGBT employee resource
group by Out & Equal Workplace Advocates . Your message and the significance carried in delivering it personally was
reflected in the silence that came over the audience of over 2,000 people when you began speaking and the furious
applause heard afterwards. While not the only GLIFAA member in attendance that night to receive the award, as the
only Foreign Service Officer there to witness the event, the award held special significance for me. Your message had
the greatest impact on everyone attending the Out & Equal Summit this year, but as a direct beneficiary of your work I
was especially touched and awed.

It is you, Under Secretary Kennedy, and all the senior staff of the Department that truly deserve this honor. As an FSO
with a domestic partner, your efforts to bring equality to State have allowed me to stay in a career I love. Thank you for
all you are doing for the LGBT community, for the Foreign and Civil Service, and for the opportunity to attend such a
conference. I am once again proud to represent the Foreign Service, the Department of State, and the Bureau of
Intelligence and Research.

With tremendous gratitude and warm regards,
