Here's what likely makes the most sense.

I will feel      out re whehter he would like to take this on and if so, what time he could give to it.

We set up a town hall with building for weds or thurs at which you announce the effort. This gives philippe and pj the
b/g of week to lay press ground work so we get the coverage we want.

If this makes sense to you, I am going to reach out to
