Thank you Madame Secretary the information you received from Jakarta is consistent with what we have now heard
from Indonesians. Scott and I just held an agency wide review of our collective Pacific wide efforts to date and where we
both need more information and where we are prepared to do more. Our team is doing a full accounting of every effort
to date and we will have this to you by mid afternoon. We are awaiting word from Luzon and I anticipate that we will
need to do much more there and in parts of Indonesia in the days ahead. We will be in touch with our interagency
colleagues throughout the day and will update you again accordingly. Thank you for your efforts and the readouts. I will
also do follow ups as you request. Best Kurt

Romulo said they welcome additional help so I told them to pls follow up w our Ambassador. I think you should follow
up as well.

On a very bad line, Wirajuda seemed to welcome our support, including helicopters and other navel assets. PIs followup
and have Navy do as well.

Let me know what else we need to do.
