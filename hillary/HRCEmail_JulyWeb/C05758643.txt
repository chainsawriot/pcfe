UPDATE (May 29):             is under consideration, but the appointment is not a done deal. Apparently he has been asked
to fill out a raft of background forms (one involves listing all the foreign nationals a candidate encountered over a period
of years, an endeavor that would take            the length of Obama's first term).




           - one people who follow the appointments process down here know is very much par for the course.
