Subject: ACTION REQUEST and UPDATE: Amcit at UN Mission in Liberia has committed suicide

Colleagues,

Charge Robinson, Embassy Monrovia, just called to report that Mr. Fosnight has committed suicide. He was
found in his home at approximately 0500 EDT. The RSO is on the scene and Monrovia's consular section is
aware of the situation and will work to repatriate the body. UNMIL is working to determine who from the UN
will call Fosnight's next-of-kin. Post had no further details, but will continue to provide them to Ops. The
Liberian Minister of Justice has asked UNMIL representatives and Charge Robinson to attend a meeting at
0730 EDT to discuss press responses. The Watch connected the PA/Press duty officer to Embassy Monrovia.

ACTION REQUEST: Embassy Monrovia has requested press guidance from the Department as soon as
possible, preferably before the 0730 EDT meeting. The Embassy prefers NOT to issue a joint statement with
Liberian or UNMIL representatives. The Embassy is closed today, but the Charge will be available by
telephone.

Ops has informed the CA/OCS, AF, and PA/Press duty officers by telephone, and stands by ready to assist.

Regards,

Stephanie L. Hallett

Subject: RE: Update: Amcit at UN Mission in Liberia - alleged illegal activity

One correction: Fosnight's passport was not / not seized. Fosnight says he can't find it (which is interesting,
since he says he planned to fly to Sierra Leone this afternoon).

And one update: So far, all the Liberian lawyers contacted have refused to take the case.

Subject: Update: Amcit at UN Mission in Liberia - alleged illegal activity

Here is today's update. Sunday has been eventful.

- Fosnight was arrested about 40 minutes ago and is under house arrest. His U.S. passport has been seized. The
Consular Officer is aware and has passed to him (via the RSO, who's on the scene) the names of three local
lawyers. The RSO reported that Fosnight is also seeking to be in touch with a U.S. lawyer. The Consular
Officer will send a report of arrest cable tomorrow, and stands ready to meet with Fosnight.

- The GOL has formally asked UNMIL to assist in making sure that the house arrest is effective, in order to
ensure that Fosnight's rights are protected and to minimize flight risk.

- Getting to this point involved a harrowing six hours. This morning at approximately 11:00 am, the Liberia
National Police, accompanied by UN Police and our RSO, went to Fosnight's apartment to carry out the
arrest. Although Fosnight had been under LNP surveillance by five officers, he managed to leave the apartment
at around 10:00 in his UN-marked vehicle. (The Director of Police will be investigating how that
happened.) Airport, immigration, police, and UN authorities were alerted.

- At approximately 3:00 pm, we learned that Fosnight was still in Monrovia and was in phone contact with
UNMIL officials as well as LNP officers. Finally, he agreed to be met by the LNP at his apartment, where he
was arrested. He was read his rights, and read the charges, which include statutory rape and exploitation of
children, among other charges. Fosnight stated that he and his Sierra Leonean ex-wife (or ex-girlfriend) - the

woman with whom he adopted the five-year old - were planning to fly out this afternoon on Elysian Air to
Freetown.

- At the apartment this morning, the arrest team discovered that Fosnight had left behind in the apartment his
five-year old daughter and housekeeper, a young Liberian man of about 20 years. The housekeeper had
recently burned a large box of papers and other items outside behind the apartment. There was no computer in
the apartment, but there was a router, which was still plugged in. The five-year old has been put into protective
custody and the housekeeper is being questioned.

- Also in LNP custody for questioning are the Liberian ex-girlfriend and the Sierra Leonean ex-wife. The Sierra
Leonean had been in the apartment in the morning and left around 10:00 am, separately from Fosnight.

- A team of ICE officers is trying to arrive Tuesday; details TBC.
