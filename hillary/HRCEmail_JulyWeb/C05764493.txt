Cheryl,




We spoke with 10, EEB, and Amb. Cousin after the meeting today and came up with the following revision to S's call
points. We decided the best language would be for the Secretary to say that if UNSYG cannot co-host, that she would
welcome the participation of his representative. The important point here is that we do not want the FAO head -
Jacques Diouf â€” to end-up co-hosting the UNGA event, and everyone agreed there was a danger Ban ki-Moon would
suggest he do so. In the background at the bottom I included a point stressing that we do not want Diouf to co-host.
