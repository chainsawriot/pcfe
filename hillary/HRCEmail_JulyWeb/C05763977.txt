Decision in Lockerbie case Thursday
LONDON (AP) The Scottish government says a decision has been reached in the case of Lockerbie bomber Abdel Baset
al-Megrahi and will be announced Thursday. A statement released Wednesday says Scottish Justice Minister Kenny
MacAskill has "informed families and other interested parties that he has reached his decisions on the applications for
prisoner transfer and compassionate release." A Scottish government spokeswoman says the minister's decision will
not be released before Thursday.
