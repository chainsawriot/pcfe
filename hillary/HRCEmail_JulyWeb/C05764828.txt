Vilsack told a powerful story about going to a school feeding program while he was in kenya in august for agoa. At lunch
time, he spooned usg donated porrage into the kids red cups. After lunch he asked the kids what their favorate part of
school was. He expected to hear "recess" or maybe reading. Instead every single child responded with "lunch - because
it is the only meal I get everyday". Vilsack was glad for what we were doing, but the event made him realize how much
more there is to do.

Keynote lunch speaker was Indra Nooyi, the chair and ceo of Pepsi Co. She noted that this event is growing in both size
and importance every year. Attendence at the lunch alone was over 950 people including Secretary Vilsack and
ministers from many countries. She specifically complemented Secretary Clinton's role in the Sept 26 UN event. Nooyi
used much of her address challenging the private sector to do their part in carrying out the strategy unveiled in New
York.

Secretary Vilsack gave a very powerful address that focused on our efforts feed hungry children and the need to do
more. He refered to working with Secretary Clinton or to "under Secretary Clinton's leadership" at least 3 times. It was
very well done.
