Subject: Higher Education Dinner on August 17 - Guest

Jake/Huma/Lona:

I've got to have Lona get invites out today - the list is 18 after speaking with the Secretary on theory we will have yield of
12 - 14.

Before I have Lona invite anyone, I want to phase invites so our highest priorities have chance to response first and need
to know how big is too big to work; I have targeted 12-14 outside guests - given an expectation of 6-8 government folks.

Proposed Outside Dinner Guest List:
