Subject: S Afghanistan mtg Paris

As some of you know, at lunch with Kouchner in Zurich, S agreed in principle to go to Paris for an informal
meeting of some key European players on Afghanistan (on Nov. 8 on the way to Berlin).




Welcome thoughts. I expect to hear further from French today what specifically they have in mind. She could
still go to Paris, but perhaps better not to let them do the Afpak meeting.
