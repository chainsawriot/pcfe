The additional calls to be made today by Susan and Scott are listed below. It is our understanding that all these calls
were made (though a couple of house members were unavailable). We have also been in touch with all leadership and
key committee staff in the house and senate and sent them the relevant fact sheet/white paper on the new policy.

Ambassador Rice: Feingold■ Leahy■ Payne

Gration: Lowey■ Ros-Lehtinen■ Lee■ Capuano■ McCaul■ Isakson■ Corker■ Brownback■ Wolf
