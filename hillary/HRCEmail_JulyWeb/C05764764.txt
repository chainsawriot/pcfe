DUBLIN, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) is about to announce the end of its violent
campaign against British control of Northern Ireland, Irish Foreign Minister Micheal Martin said on Sunday. "That's a
welcome development," Martin told journalists ahead of his talks with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Asked
whether he wanted the INLA to decommission its weapons, Martin said: "Absolutely. My understanding is that would be
part of the statement emanating from the INLA that they are ceasing all violent activity."
