 Hillary:

 Below and attached is a note on CTBT Conference. After reviewing, see if you think it makes sense for you to
 attend. We do and have vetted the idea with others. Of note is that this would be on 24 Sept after the President
 has chaired the Non-Proliferation Security Council Meeting so it will be amplifying his remarks. We also will
 have to think through, if you do this, what the Hill angle is but we think there is a good case to be made for it so
 we will want to discuss with you this week.

The one item we not sure of is part of item 2, in particular at what level. We may be able to get some indication, but of
course, it would also depend on us. If S were to speak, I think others might have their FMs speak as well.

Hi guys,

Can you provide, by COB today, an informal note that lays out in brief:

       1. The purpose of this conference
       2. Who you expect to participate (which countries and at what level)
       3. What message S would deliver in her remarks; and
       4. Any other info you think would be helpful in making a decision

I like this idea a lot, provided that there is broad FM participation and we have a useful message to deliver.
