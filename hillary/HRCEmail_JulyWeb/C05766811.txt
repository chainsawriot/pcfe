We will start to develop a running list of these result oriented diplomatic interventions — on individual cases, laws and
policies — exactly what we need to tell the larger story.




thanks

I love how these leaders always claim they didn't know about the legislation. Same thing Karzai said.

But if this gets done, I'd like to put it out in a small way that we fixed it, just to have as a marker out there for the big
speech, whenever it is.

FYI.

We had asked Johnnie to address this issue based upon reports that Uganda had legislation moving up that was going to
criminalize homosexuality with the death penalty as a sanction.

Cheryl:

My blackberry is down so I'm sending you a quick note from Uganda via Ambassador Jerry Lanier's account.

I met this morning with President Museveni in Entebbe. I raised with him the issue of the draconian legislation
proposed to criminalize homosexual activity. Museveni was unaware of the legislation but thought it was excessive and
out of order. He said he would work with members of Parliament to revise the legislation to make it a crime for adults
to solicit or recruit minors into any homo- or heterosexual activities. Activities between consenting adults would be
stripped from the legislation. I think we rolled the worst and most concerning part of this back.

Regards, Johnnie
