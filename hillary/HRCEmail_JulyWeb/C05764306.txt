Dear Cheryl,

I don't know who the Goodspot Production company is, but they certainly hit the "sweet spot" on this one. So
powerful, visually and the narration. I'm sending it all over the place.
The Secretary talked to Jim about the video (they ran into each other at National Airport, go figure).
We're going to send the link to all the House Hunger Caucus members and encourage them to put it on their
web sites.
In the meantime, knowing how much leisure time you have on your hands, and using Matt Damon as the "link"
between the two, check out this video clip from this week's episode of Entourage where Matt Damon talks
about US domestic hunger — hilarious, but tough —

(And, in my typical single-minded way, if you do a Spanish version of your global food security video, you
might want to ask Juanes to do the narration — I'm pretty sure he'd say yes.)

Enjoy!
