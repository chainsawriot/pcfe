I think your speech in N.I. is among your best as SecState and an effort should be made to publish
the heart of it in the International Herald Tribune, Irish papers and a British paper (perhaps the
Guardian). I am doubtful a US paper would publish a long excerpt pared to a long -op-ed but
identified as an excerpt of your speech, but one that might is the Boston Globe. Sid
