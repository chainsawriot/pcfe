Subject:                          Book about your Puerto Rico campaign



Our Co-Chairs, now Sec. of State McClintock and Dem. Comm. Chair Prats, have written a book about a campaign that
was historic in terms of a majority in PR and cooperation between statehooders and commonwealthers.

They want a foreword by you & WJC and pictures of your visits. I'll follow up with Cheyrl and Laura Graham on the
foreward and can do a draft if one is OK.

On Palau, I'll be following up with Jake. State's proposal would cut per capita income 20% over six years and 10% over
the 15 of the agreement being sought.

Jeff
