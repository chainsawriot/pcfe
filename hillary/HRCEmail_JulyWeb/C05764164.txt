Dear Secretary Clinton:

         As you know, last month eight rockets were fired into Kabul, two landing near the
 Embassy.1 Not long after, at least seven people were killed and 91 wounded, ind uch ng '
 when a suicide bomber stuck dose to the Embassy. Following the second attack, c
 spokesman declared that the target had been the U.S. Embassy itself. 2 In respon
 other incidents, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Michael M ul len
 situation in Afghanistan is " wrious and it is deteriorati ng." 3

        In light of this increasingly violent and uncertain environment, effective se:.
 U.S. Embassy in Kabul aid the nearly one thousand U.S. diplomats, staff, and Afgna

 numerous other serious probl ems with its performance, i nd udi ng a I ack of Engi

 deficiencies identified in
 training of the guard force. State further informed AGNA that, due to the contractor'
 weaknesses and deficiencies, the Department was conside-i ng not extending the COtitrP.:
 another year."

          I n July 2008, despite AGNA' s continuing problems, State decided to extend the
 for an additional yea, noting that based on satisfactory meetings with the incomi ng Waci
 managers, it was "reasonable" to expect that all performance problems would be correc.it''

 that it questioned the contractor' s abi

 to extend it until 2012.18 Yet the extensive evidence provided to POGO of contintief

 that the State Department has failed in its oversight of its security contractor.

 Serious Security Vulnerabilities

 Was Congress Misled?

         Despite Wackenhut Vice Resident Sam Brinkley' s sworn Senate testimony that '
 Kabul contract has been fully-staffed since January 2009..." the truth is that chronic,
 understaffi ng of the guard force conti nues to be a m4 or problem.19 And evidence sLicic;,
 Brinkley knew that. Around March, according to numerous pati ci pals, he was writ v.)
 some 50 guards at Camp Sullivan who complained to him directly about a severe, ongoi t
 shortage. Then, in an April 2009 memo to a State Department official, U.S. Embassy K ;4!
 guard force Commander Werner I I i c reported that guard shortages had caused chroni •
 deprivation among his men. He described a situation i n which guards habitualI y fa-,
 day work cyd es extending for as many as eight weeks in a row, frequently al tern
 day and night shifts. He cond uded that "this ultimately diminishes the LGF' s I '
 Force's] ability to provide security." (Attachment 1) The contract with the &a t--
 specifies that guards may not be on duty for longer than 12 consecutive hours.-1)
 documents meet that short-staffing frequently results in the denial of contractuall\f .•
 leave and vacation, and that those who do not comply are threatened with termi nation •:.)

 Supervisors Engaging in Deviant Hazing and Humiliation

 supervisors and guards are engaging in near-weekly deviant hazing and humiliation of
 subordinates. Witnesses report that the highest levels of AGNA management in Kat,..<!

 Sullivan submitted a signed statement dated August 16, 2009, attesting that a guard to!
 supervisor and four others entered a dining facility on August 1, 2009, wearing on!
 underwear and brandishing bottles of alcohol. Upon leaving the facility, the guard.
 supervisor allegedly grabbed the Afghan national by the face and began abusing
 language, saying, "You are very good for fXXXi ng." The Afghan national rep:
 too afraid of them I could not tell them any thing." (Attachment 4)

 the danger that gua-dscould have been drawn into a mil itay incident with or tai,
 Tel i ban or Afghan locals, and created a vulnerability at the Embassy by removinc, ;
 equipment, leaving the Embassy largely night-blind. AGNA management awarded
 commendation to 18 pati ci pants trumpeting their "Intrepidity" in a document i
 bearing the seal of the Department of State. (Attachment 5)

         According to many guards, another situation in which Embassy security may hv
 compromised is when, on at least one occasion, supervisors brought prostitutes in to C4
 Sullivan. This is a breach of security and discipline made worse because the prostrti

 Sense of Congress that "private security contractors are not authorized to perform i i~ her
 governmental functions in an area of combat operations."27 This language was
 from legislation that.had passed the Senateactively prohibiting private security f r.;,
 performing inherently governmental functions.28 In neither case, however, did thr.
 I alguage recognize protecting a diplomatic mission in a combat zone as an i n1-4
 governmental function. At the very least, this is a question that needs to be exami
 the protection of the U.S, Embassy Kabul and other embassies in combat zones.

          The use of private contractors for security in a combat zone poses several di i en-,r -
 is the inherent tension between the effective performance of a mission and the financi,--'
 of' the contractor. Cutting costs is good for the bottoM line, but can put security at risk
 case against AGNA brought by two former U.S. Embassy Kabul guard force supe-v,
 Sauer aid Peter Martino, illustrates this problem. According to the complaint, AGNA.
 "acknowledged that AGNA had underbid:the contract in order to secure it," and told
 Mali no "to make do' and put a `good face' on the situation to ensure that a profit wail.
 made on the contract and that shareholders would be sati sfi ed....Defendants i mpl ernerm.,'
 requiring more hours per i ndi Vi dual and fewer shifts of staff in order to cut costs a; '
 Defendants' profit margin." 29 This is a dear exaTipleof the contractor endaigeim
 diplomatic mission in order to advance its bottom line.

        Another dilemma is the threat of work-stoppages—which, according to v.,
happened at least twice with the U.S. Embassy Kabul guard force. On two separaiE
the Gurkhas (who make up two-thirds of the guard force) threatened to walk off the ,

          Yet another di I emma is that the laws i n place do not adequately hold account abl
contractors who violate rules and endanger security i n combat zones. Unlike the mi I i tare
once had the responsibility of guarding embassies and which is bound by the Uniform C.,
M i I itary Justice, private employers such as security firms cannot ensure a binding chain
command that provides adequate discipline and professionalism i n the guard force

 Contractor in Need of Oversight

          POGO is concerned that the security of the U.S. Embassy Kabul is in the hand-
 contractor that has knowingly and repeatedly provided substandad equipment and
 example, to cut costs, AGNA " downgrade[d] the quality of the vehi des to be punch;-:s'
 AGNA sought to maximize its profit by sacrificing the quality of protective vehi d es
 secure the Embassy. I n addition, as mentioned earl i er, the State Department has rep
 chastised AGNA for the contractor's repeated fei I ures to fulfill staffing, I anguage
 contract provisions. AGNA has also fa I ed to properly manage Carp Sullivan, ar.
 detj I ed above.

         The problems with AGNA' s U.S. Embassy Kabul security contract do not
 unique for this contractor. Recently, an ArmorGroup security guard in Baghdad' s
 al I egedl y shot and ki I led two fel I ow guards and wounded at I east one Iraqi . Extraordi na
 guard had a criminal record and was descri bed by one security guard who worked with 'I:
 walking time-bomb," yet was hired by ArmorGroup anyvvay.il This particular incident
 serious concerns about ArmorGroup' s vetting process, and adds to the bigger picture a; •
 contractor in serious need of strict oversight.

 Recommendations

 1.After two yeas of fj I ed attempts by the Department of State to upgrade the pert,,;
 its private security contractors in both Afghanistan and Iraq, the Department shot ;I(
 arrangement with Defense Secretary Gates to provide i mmedi ate mil itary supervi'i,
 private security force at the U.S. embassies in Kabul and Baghdad.

2.The State Department should promptly i niti ate a thorough and i ndependent i t w
U.S. Embassy Kabul security contract in order to hold corporations as wel I as i ndi
accountable for the above noted misconduct and contract violations. amply removi ng
people from contract management at AGNA or Wackenhut, or creating a new corporate ,-
compliance officer, is not going to ensure serious accountabi I ity. Al I owi ng those respon
quietly resign and seek work with other U.S. contractors, as guard force whist! ebl owes
happening now, will only perpetuate this problem.

3.State Department representatives either knew or should have known about this 1 oi ty
and dangerous situation regarding U.S. Embassy Kabul security. The State Department
repeated warnings to AGNA were of no consequence, and Department officials rasp-1r
oversight of this contract themselves should be held accountable.

 4. Those w hi sti ebi owers who have come forward to disclose the mismanagement 01
 Department contract should be protected from retaliation for doing so.

 5. The State Department should consi der whether the security of an embassy in a conIhr.
 an inherently governmental function, and therefore not subject to contracting out. The;;
 i n the 2009 National Defense A uthori zati on Act could be strengthened to prohi bit ti le
 private security contractors for inherently governmental functi ons, and to include protec
 the di pl omati c miss on i n a combat zone as being inherently governmenta . If embassy
 in combat zones is determined not to be an inherently governmental function, the Sae
 Department should consi der requiring military supervision of its pri vale securi ty cot
 guarding U.S. embassies in combat zones.

 6. The State Department should consi der initiating suspension and debarment 1,
 against the companies ArmorGroup North America, Inc. (AGNA) and Wackenh:
 as wel I as agai nst any i ndivi dual employees of these companies who were re pot
 contract-related i mpropri eti es or abuses, to prevent these entities from enteri ng i nt r_
 contracts with the federal government.
