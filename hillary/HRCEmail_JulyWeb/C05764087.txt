I couldn't agree more. It should be a letter, and we shouldn't be too defensive.

This is a time-worn tactic of the GOSL: have a conniption when someone says something you don't like, characterize the
statement in the worst possible way (never mind that she also referred to the Balkans and nobody from Bosnia or Serbia
is making a fuss) and force the other side to back down, abjectly.

I think Philippe makes a good point. We don't want to make this a bigger story, so if it makes sense for me to respond I
have no objection to that course. Let me know how you want to proceed.

A letter from Melanne that makes its way into the public domain achieves the same goal of putting out a countering
narrative to whatever handful of outlets have covered this.

But coming from Melanne it is far more confirming of HRC's statement, as opposed to a widely released spokesman
statement which will invariably read like a correction/retraction. I fear how the 3,000 outlets who have not even noticed
this issue will react to this statement.

And with a letter from Melanne, the Sri Lankans still get a response - arguable a more substantive one

Jake, I was in this same place an hour ago when we had a conference call with the Secretary. She feels that this has
generated a great deal of media commentary in various quarters, including prominent outlets in this country (LAT) and
in Asia that we have no choice but to respond in a public way. Government supporters are saying that she is listening to
the Tamil diaspora. What this does is reinforces her statement, but gives the government a little something on recent
experience, and then does the pivot to reconciliation and what they need to do now, reinforcing our current policy.

Having read this I wonder if this is better done as a clarifying letter from Melanne to Sri Lankan FM that we publicly
release?

Having the spokesman clarify the Secretary's words in an official statement has a slightly uncomfortable feel to it. It
requires us to set up the critique and then respond to it, rather than just having an official and direct response to the
protest that we can point others to.

In the second paragraph, between the second and third sentence, do you want to say explicitly that "this was the basis
of the Secretary's statement"? Just a thought.

STATEMENT BY THE SPOKESMAN

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in remarks Wednesday before the United Nations Security Council on the adoption of a
resolution to combat sexual violence in armed conflict, stated that we have seen rape used as a tactic before in a
number of countries. In her statement, she specifically cited Sri Lanka, which prompted an official protest by the
Government of Sri Lanka and some news commentary around the world.

Regarding the Secretary's reference to Sri Lanka in her address, we want to be clear. Over the course of the difficult
conflict between the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), stretching well into this
decade, the State Department as well as credible human rights organizations substantiated numerous reports of rape
and sexual violence in Sri Lanka, particularly acts committed against women held in detention by the government. At the
same time, in the most recent phase of the conflict, from 2006 to 2009, though we remained deeply concerned about
reports of extrajudicial killings, disappearances and mistreatment of detainees, we have not received reports that rape
and sexual abuse were used as tools of war, as they clearly have in other conflict areas around the world. We hope that
this clarification puts the issue in its proper context.

This controversy should not detract from the specific actions that Sri Lanka needs to take now. With the end of the
military conflict, Secretary Clinton believes strongly that Sri Lanka must focus to the future and move forward on the
promotion of peace and the protection of human rights. The government of Sri Lanka should release more than 250,000
displaced persons who are still confined in camps, and lead a process of genuine political and social reconciliation that
changes how the Sinhalese and Tamil people relate to each other. The United States stands ready to assist and support
the people of Sri Lanka with these critical challenges.
