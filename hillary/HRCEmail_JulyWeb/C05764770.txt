Subject: (AP) Bulgarian diplomat wins UNESCO race

PARIS (AP) UNESCO says a career diplomat from Bulgaria has defeated a controversial Egyptian candidate to head the
United Nations agency for culture and education. The chairman of UNESCO's executive board says Bulgaria's
ambassador to France, Irina Bokova, has beaten longtime Egyptian Culture Minister Farouk Hosny in secret
balloting. UNESCO's press office says Bokova won 31 to 27 Tuesday in a suspenseful fifth round. The Egyptian was long
considered a favorite, despite his threat last year to burn Israeli books, and Egypt's contentious record of cultural
censorship under his watch. Hosny apologized for the book-burning comment, but many Jewish activists said he was
unfit to be the U.N.'s guardian of culture.
