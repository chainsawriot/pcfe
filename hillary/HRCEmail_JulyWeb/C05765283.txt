Subject: Honduran Congress will rule on Zelaya after vote

TEGUCIGALPA (AP) -The leader of the Honduran Congress said lawmakers would not decide whether to restore ousted
President Manuel Zelaya until after the November 29 presidential elections. Congressional president Jose Alfredo
Saavedra said lawmakers would vote December 2 on whether Zelaya should return to the presidency. The decision
raises questions about whether the international community would recognize the outcome of the elections. Several
countries have warned they would not recognize the vote unless Zelaya is restored beforehand. The United States has
not ruled out restoring diplomatic ties with a newly elected Honduran government even if Zelaya remains out of power
through the vote.
