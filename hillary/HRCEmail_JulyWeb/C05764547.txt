Subject: 8/26 Senior Staff Meeting

Sensitive But Unclassified

UNASUR Letter on Colombia

      •    Cheryl and Jim said they both thought that there were things missing from the latest WHA draft of a letter from
           the Secretary to UNASUR members. The goal is to get the final version to the Secretary as soon as possible.

Mitchell meeting with Netanvahu

      •    Cheryl noted that the Secretary will receive a readout from Senator Mitchell on his meeting with Prime Minister
           Netanyahu shortly.

Libya

      •    Bill reported that Jeff Feltman has not heard back definitively on Qaddafi's decision about staying in New Jersey
           during UNGA. Pat Kennedy said he had talked to USUN about possibly allowing Qaddafi to pitch his tent in Fort
           Hamilton in Brooklyn. Mike Polt noted that he had spoken to Congressman Rothman twice yesterday, and that
           Rothman expressed hope we would have a definitive answer from the Libyans by Sunday, when the Rabbi in
           Englewood, N.J. plans a protest at the Libyan Residence.

H1N1

      •    Pat said he had received a call from John Brennan thanking State for providing data on H1N1 outbreaks in the
           Southern Hemisphere and asking relevant desks to let their embassies know that the USG would be issuing a
           report on this.

Honduras

      •    Harold said he had signed off on an action memo to the Secretary along with WHA and F regarding restrictions
           on assistance to Honduras. (I subsequently confirmed that the package has not yet come forward to the Line -
           it is awaiting WHA front office clearance and Jim Steinberg's final approval.)

      •    Derek Chollet said that S/P has drafted the options memo for the Secretary on the upcoming Presidential
           election in Honduras.

•     Ian said he anticipated questions on Qaddafi and UNGA, Senator Mitchell's meeting with PM Netanyahu, and
      the results of the delegation to Honduras. He noted in this regard that the decision to suspend NIV issuances in
      Honduras attracted relatively little attention, but any decision with respect to a possible cut off in assistance
      would attract a great deal more.

•     Ian noted that CNN is running with a story based apparently on a State IG report faulting the Department for
      being slow in planning for the safety and effectiveness of U.S. civilians in Iraq in the wake of the U.S. military
      withdrawal. Pat said he thought this was based on an old IG report. Jim said that our line should be that we are
      confronting the implications of the military withdrawal, that we have an elaborate planning process in place,
      and that we are focused heavily on the safety and security of remaining USG employees.

•     RI noted that the Secretary will issue a statement on Senator Kennedy's death, and that Senator Mitchell also
      would put out a message in his capacity as a former Senate colleague.

•     Finally, PJ reported that ABC has not yet given up on the story related to a Soviet-style effort by the Russians to
      entrap/smear a Department employee in Moscow. (The incident in question stems from the time the employee
      did not work for the Department, but was studying Russian language in Vladivostok.) We are trying to convince
      ABC that this is not a story and if there is a story, it is that the Russians continue to use old techniques to try to
      entrap our employees.
