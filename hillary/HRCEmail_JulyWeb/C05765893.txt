Cheryl:

I heard from             today on the temporary ambassadorial arrangement at which you and she arrived. First and
foremost, thank you for working toward a conclusion to a complicated matter. Your efforts are greatly appreciated by
the Senator and me.

Once the ambassadorship expires,             most likely pursue some other appointment in the administration which,
depending on the position, I suspect Senator Menendez will support as he is hopeful she might receive the opportunity
to serve in a more fulsome manner.

Again, you were tremendous to wrap this matter up.

Danny.

Cheryl:

Greetings and congratulations on the Secretary's successes in bringing about a responsible and sane foreign policy
during her short tenure at State.

Senator Menendez asked that I bring the following matter to your attention. This past February                             B6
                                                                                                             - an          B6
ambassadorial level appointment.                                                                                           B6
                                                                              There has been considerable confusion        B6
around                 role and responsibilities                                    The bottom line is that         was   B6
led to believe the appointment would come with more responsibilities than the ones associated with the two-week
meetings. She is anxious to serve in a larger capacity than present. The Senator is hopeful the commitments made to        B6
        can be fulfilled, even if she were to be given a different portfolio.                                             B6

I understand either you or your staff will meet with               in the near future. In advance, we thank you for
whatever you can do to find a solution to the current situation. Please feel free to email me or call me at               B6
should you want to discuss this matter further.

Good luck in all your endeavors.

Danny O'Brien
