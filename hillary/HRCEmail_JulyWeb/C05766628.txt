With your permission, we are changing the statement to spokesman's name rather than yours. Makes it a more generic
statement of U.S. policy and holds you in reserve.

We have tweaked the first paragraph to make clear our expectation.

On Mexico, consensus is that a call is worthwhile, but we will get you an updated call sheet that accounts for intervening
events.

The remaining Honduras related call sheets are also coming your way.

Please let me know if I can help with anything else.
