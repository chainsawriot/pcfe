Subject: Honduras: Quiet Talks

To All:

Arturo Corrales, a de facto supporter with whom we have maintained contact, told our USOAS chief today that
he has been in touch directly with Zelaya regarding a possible deal involving political amnesty, acceptance of
"most" of the San Jose Accord, and mutually agreed upon political reforms. This effort builds upon Corrales
meetings last week with the pro-Zelaya Honduran permrep at the UN. Pressed upon whether this was serious
or simply a de facto effort to buy time and avoid further U.S. pressure, Corrales insisted that there was a real
chance for a deal as early as Thursday.

Caveat: We have encouraged Corrales to keep at it and stay in touch with us, but we have heard about similar
soundings in the past that later went awry, so a healthy dose of skepticism is in order. The Secretary can
sound out Zelaya about this tomorrow as she urges him to get serious about reaching a deal.
