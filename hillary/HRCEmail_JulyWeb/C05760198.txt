I agree with      doing this - she is quite good so saying yes unless you have other thoughts.                                B5

Dear Cheryl:

To update you on H1N1 and make a recommendation as we move forward.

I have asked            to take the lead in the H1N1 negotiations, and she has been participating in the meetings with
WH, HHS, DOD and others. At this time, she is leading the discussions with other donors — UK, Australia, Swiss and
others — so they can work in a coordinated fashion under our leadership. Her expertise and knowledge in this area has
really helped in interacting with HHS and addressing the technical issues. She has also participated in meetings with Jack
Lew. I expect that this effort will require a considerable amount of her time for the next few weeks.

With the departure of             and because we are in the middle of addressing the H1N1 pandemic, I recommend               B5
that we name                                                                        Based on this topic and growing       '   B6
importance of health diplomacy we are discussing ways to elevate and strengthen the health function within OES. We
hope to establish a Health Directorate, and expect to have that in place in approximately six months. This responsibility
could then be transferred to the Health DAS. I have discussed this with            and she is in agreement.

I would be happy to talk about this if useful.

Many thanks, and hope you get some rest this weekend!

Maria
