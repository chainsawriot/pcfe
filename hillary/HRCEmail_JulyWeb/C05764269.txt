Hi there,
Wow, just re-read my response to you and it's unintelligible--my apologies. I type so quickly on my
Blackberry and don't proof read which I later regret.

Secretary Clinton was wonderful and so gracious to do the interview during her much needed vacation. I have
covered many of the issues that we discussed and feel so passionately about them as well.

If I can ever help with anything, please don't hesitate to let me know. I'm so delighted that Secretary Clinton is
spearheading so many vital efforts to help women around the world.

Best regards,
Lisa
