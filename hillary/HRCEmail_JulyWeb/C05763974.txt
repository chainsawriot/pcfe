Pakistan PM effectively rules out treason charges
ISLAMABAD (AP) Pakistan's prime minister on Wednesday effectively ruled out bringing treason charges against the
country's former military ruler, Pervez Musharraf. Pakistan's Supreme Court recently ruled that Musharraf's imposition
of a state of emergency in 2007 was unconstitutional a decision that raised the possibility he could be accused of
treason. But Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani had said such charges would only be brought against Musharraf if
Parliament passed a unanimous resolution requesting them. Speaking in Parliament on Wednesday night, Gilani said the
opposition parties did not have enough votes to pass the resolution indicating his own party would not vote in favor.
