                      Status of DynCorp Aviation Task Order 15



 IF ASKED ONLY

 Q: Will DynCorp assume the Aviation Task Order in Iraq on September 4th?

 A: DynCorp is under contract to begin the Worldwide Personal Protective
 Services (WPPS) II Task Order 15 for aviation services in Iraq on September
 4. The State Department has arranged for a temporary extension of the
 transition between U.S. Training Center (formerly Blackwater) and DynCorp.



 Q. Why is this extension necessary?

 A. The deployment of an aviation program in Iraq is a complex challenge -- a
 slower transition to DynCorp taking over the task order is in the best interest
 of the government.



 Q. Has the Government of Iraq been informed of this action?

 A. Yes



  Q: Has the Iraqi Government approved of this action?

  A: The government of Iraq has been informed that additional time is needed
  to allow us to finish the transition from U.S. Training Center to DynCorp's
  aviation program.

 Q: If DynCorp is not ready to take over the task order on September 4, doesn't
 that mean they have defaulted on the contract? What kind of penalties are being
 assessed on Dyncorp for their failure to perform on time?



 A: The government has a variety of options at its disposal to ensure that the
 government and the taxpayers are protected.



 Q: Will the current task order be extended?

 A: Yes, we have unilaterally extended the current task order with U.S.
 Training Center to ensure the continued security and safety of U.S. personnel
 in Iraq.



 Q: What are these aircraft used for?

 A: The aircraft used in the Embassy's aviation operations facilitate the
 continued security and safety of U.S. personnel in Iraq.



 Q: How long will this extension remain in effect?

 A: This is a limited extension meant to facilitate the completion of the
 transition.




  FOR THE BRIEFERS EYES ONLY- PROCUREMENT SENSITIVE

  This is the final of three Iraq task orders that the Department is transitioning from
  US Training Center (formerly Blackwater) to other WPPS vendors in light of the
  GOI's January 2009 decision not to grant the company a security operating license.
