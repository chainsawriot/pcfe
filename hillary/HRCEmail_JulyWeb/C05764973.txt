Cheryl,

Rich and I met this morning with Chris Socha, Senator DeMint's foreign policy staffer. We took the
opportunity to discuss the nominations of Tom Shannon and Arturo Valenzuela. As you know, DeMint has
been very outspoken regarding Zelaya's ouster in Honduras.

With respect to Tom, it appears as though little has changed - DeMint still appears to be insisting on some
amount of floor debate followed by a roll call vote on the nomination. How much time and when is still
something that needs to be worked out. We've been following up on our end, but the DeMint camp has
slow walked things a bit. We expect to come to some agreement when the Senate reconvenes.

Arturo's nomination is in a different posture. As we approached the Senate's August recess, there
appeared to be some loosening of DeMint's hold on him. After speaking with DeMint's staff, we're still
hopeful that we could get Arturo confirmed by either voice vote or by unanimous consent when the Senate
returns. However, Chris warned that DeMint is monitoring closely the Administration's position
with regards to sanctions. He warned that if a coup determination is made and new sanctions
levied, this could very well have an adverse impact on how Arturo's nomination moves forward.

We wanted to alert you to this latter point because we understand a determination from L
could be coming down shortly.

DeMint's staffer explained that the Senator would welcome a call from either S or Deputy Steinberg, and
he thought a call could go a long way to freeing up Arturo's nomination. We're preparing a call sheet for
Deputy Steinberg.

Thanks.
