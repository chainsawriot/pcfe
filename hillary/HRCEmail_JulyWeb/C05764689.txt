To:                               H
Subject:                          Pres. of Palau today



Wouldn't tell him U have a $ # & will work with him within it. State has just agreed to a meeting 9/28 to determine
Palau's needs. Such a
meeting is required by the Compact as a step before agreeing on aid.
Having a # before makes a sham of the meeting. Palau has rejected the # & wouldn't accept it even if the Pres. did. He
won't because it would deplete Trust Fund by 2024 or so altho it is to last thru 2044 term of base rights, forcing Palau to
hope US will replenish fund in
2024. Explaining this to Jake too.
