Someone sent this article to me yesterday it was entitled:

"It's 3 a.m. Do You Know Where Hillary Clinton Is?
She's not answering those crisis calls at the White House. But she's quietly revolutionizing American foreign policy."

I can imagine how intense this week was as you and the entire Spence clan gave Big Roy the best ever sendoff.

Does your title refer to the ad or something else?
