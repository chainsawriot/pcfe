    The Quadrennial "America's Place in the World" survey conducted both generally among the
        American public and among Council on Foreign Relations members found that "a plurality
        of the (American) public now says that China, not the United States, is the world's leading
        economic power. Currently, 44% of the public says China is the world's leading economic
        power, while just 27% name the United States. As recently as the beginning of last year, 41%
        said the U.S. was the top economic power while 3 0 % said China." On the brighter side,
        'Despite widespread anxiety over the economy, public support for free trade agreements has
        increased since 2008. A modest plurality now sees free trade agreements as good for the
        U.S.; in April 2008, a plurality said such agreements were bad for the country." The two
        sentiments may well be related, of course.
