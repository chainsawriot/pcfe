will get it to AFP and other interest parties. So by noon everyone who needs it will have it

PJ, correct me if I'm wrong but I think the letter text was finalized, but not yet produced/delivered. If so, we will make
sure that happens asap, and shared with AFP (who is the only outlet I've seen on this today)

Given the AFP story today, have we delivered letter and given to appropriate press, now including AFP?
