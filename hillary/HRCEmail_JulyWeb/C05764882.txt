I may see the POTUS Wed afternoon or evening per my conversation w him today. He's checking his schedule. Can you
reach out to WH?

People I saw at funeral who I want to see or who want to see me--

Randy Weingarten--reschedule dinner w her and Hillary Rosen

Dianne Feinstein--put her on my call list

Do you know about a conference that Schwarzenegger said he invited me to in CA in late Sept or Oct about the
environment?
