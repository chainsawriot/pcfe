Huma: I was just typing one. Not surprisingly, the hardliner supporters of the regime, when they got wind of the deal
today, mounted a counterattack, urging M not to leave. We are pushing back as we speak, and our de facto sources
who support the deal are working to nail it down.

We are making the point that M's agreement to us to step aside fueled our successful efforts over last couple days to
keep Euros and many Latins in the game but they need a change on the ground to support elections. M cannot pull
rug out now. Moreover, we said since the de factos claim moral authority (over Zelaya) for carrying out the Oct 30
Accord, they cannot go back on this deal with us.

Will give you updates. I have an open ticket to go back down at any moment if necessary. Will let you know if an S call
would help.

Best,

ck
