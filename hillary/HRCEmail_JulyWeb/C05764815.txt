Subject: S message to World Food Prize

S message just played as part of opening ceremony. It was very well received. WFP's Amb Ken Quinn discussed the
Secretary's powerful statement in June when the winner of this year's prize was announced. Quinn went on to say that
"I have been working on these issues for over 32 years, and I think that the Secretary understands these issues and is
more committed to fighting hunger than any of her predecessors". Meeting off to a good start.
Bill
