Cheryl - please tell the Secretary that Alec and his delegation in Mexico have done an incredible job. Carlos Slim just
agreed to open his cell phone network to free text messages for people reporting acts of violence, crime and corruption.
We now will work out how to use this information for police tips and public transparency. This is huge, and we are just
at the cusp of understanding the potential power of this tool. Carlos
