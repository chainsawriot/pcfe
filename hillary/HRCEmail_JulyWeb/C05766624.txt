for three-to-four months a year to prepare for and attend the           session.




Issues:

   •             was proposed as                       with the rank of Ambassador before the confirmation of
          Melanne Verveer, who now has the rank of Ambassador and would be the only credible chair of the US
          delegation this year.        confirmation for the rank of Ambassador cannot go forward unless she
          chairs the upcoming delegation.

   •                long said that she would only resign from                        after her confirmation. But
          because she expected to resign, she                                                        is officially over
                                                                           Although she would no doubt be ye
          disappointed if she didn't get confirmed, it would be less of a political issue for her after the end


   •                                                                                                     which, among
          other things, will give her entrée to research

    •     Even           changed course and asked to pursue her earlier idea of a full-time job that would allow
          her to serve on the      delegation as well, there are now no obvious positions that would be
          appropriate for her at USUN, State in DC or USAID, at least for the time being.

    •     With the passage of time,                     increasingly assuming that her rank of Ambassador is in
          jeopardy. For one thing, she might not even be confirmed before theF7 session, given the number of
          other candidates in the pipeline for hearings early next year. At this point I think she would be pleased
          to be on the US delegation and have a role in the preparations and follow-up — although she may still try
          to get Menendez to intervene on her behalf for a better deal.
