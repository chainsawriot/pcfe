SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED

Tegucigalpa/San Jose Accord: Both delegations reached agreement this morning on the text of the preamble to the
"Tegucigalpa/San Jose Accord." They also reached agreement on Article 8 (Final Dispositions), the calendar of
implementation of the Accord (Article 9), as well a final declaration (Article 10). Both delegations also prepared a new
Article (11) giving thanks and special mention for their support to the U.S. (President Obama and Secretary Clinton), the
OAS and President Arias. Both delegations signed the Tegucigalpa/San Jose Accord about mid-day today. As per its
terms, the Accord is effective the moment it is signed. Both delegations also submitted a copy of the Accord to the
National Congress about 2 PM this afternoon. The two sides plan to continue working this weekend with support from
OAS staff re selecting the four member (2 Honduran and 2 international) Verification Commission. Both delegations
expressed a strong preference for nominating Colin Powell (improbable due to his heavy travel schedule). Other names
being considered include President Lagos of Chile, Sanguinetti of Uruguay, Governor Bill Richardson and Senator Mel
Martinez. The Accord calls for the Verification Commission to be created by November 2. We understand that OAS
Secretary General Insulza plans to arrive in Tegucigalpa on Sunday, November 1. The OAS is helping to organize a public
ceremony commemorating the Accord on the morning of November 2. Both sides and the OAS plan to invite regional
heads of state and foreign ministers. We expect President Arias and other Central American heads of state to attend the
ceremony. We've heard that Z and M are already in contact, through intermediaries, with the objective of creating a
government of national unity. Under the terms of the Accord, the new government must be formed between the
signing of the Accord (today) and NLT November 5.

While the current calendar of implementation appears to be going well, we expect Congressional approval of Article 6 to
be complicated. While the presidential candidates support the Accord, there is concern within the parties about the
timing of its implementation, particularly on the eve of the election. We will continue to reach out to political leaders
and all sides and encourage them to support the expeditious implementation of the Accord.

Diplomatic Front: We've heard that the regime Foreign Ministry is inviting Ambassadors back into the country. The
Swedish Ambassador, who is resident in Guatemala, is here on a visit and plans to attend the Accord ceremony on
November 2. We are also expecting the Spanish Ambassador, Ignacio Ruperez, to arrive this weekend. OAS PODIR
Victor Rico told us that he plans to return to DC tomorrow, but will come back later next week.

Elections: The Swedish Ambassador told me she will be meeting with the Supreme Electoral Tribunal and discuss the
renewed Swedish elections assistance. We also understand that the Japanese are planning to move forward with
support for the elections process. Finally, the UN pulled back plans to withdraw its elections technical assistance
team. Most eyes, however, are on the OAS and specifically what the Permanent Council will do about sending an
elections observer mission.
