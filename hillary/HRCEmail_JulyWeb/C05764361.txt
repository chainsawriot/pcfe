Cheryl

I think this gets what the Secretary needs right away

Saving the blue ribbon panel to address your good question of

I led the blackwater panel and am willing to lead again

Would recommend taking someone retired from outside of State who has contracting oversight experience and some
Hill credibility. --- would suggest

Would also get one other outsider with some experience in overseeing contract security overseas (impt fact is overseas)

Fourth member would be eric boswell

Regards

Pat

I fully agree that we have to act fast and demonstrate that the Secretary will not accept either failure to follow the
contract or improper conduct

But a blue ribbon panel takes time to assemble, coordinate with other agencies and get a report out

We must move faster

My suggestion is a small fast panel (3 or 4) to go out and look at specifics in kabul and report back to the Secretary
immediately on on steps that can be taken right away




Team would go out monday the 9th look at contractor oversight and propose quick changes (both on the contractors
part and by State)

That way the Secretary will have implemented changes by the end of the month at latest

Regards

Pat
