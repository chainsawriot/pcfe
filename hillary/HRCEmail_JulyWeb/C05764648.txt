Subject: (AP) Ferrero-Waldner abandons race for UNESCO top job

 PARIS (AP) EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner is withdrawing her candidacy for the top job at
the United Nations agency for culture and education. Paris-based UNESCO is choosing a new director in voting that
began Thursday and continues Monday. Austrian Ferrero-Waldner was considered a strong candidate. The front-runner
is Egyptian Farouk Hosni, opposed by Jewish activists. He threatened last year to burn Israeli books, but later
apologized. The Austrian Foreign Ministry announced Sunday that Ferrero-Waldner was withdrawing "for the greater
good of the organization and European unity," and urged respect for UNESCO's ideals. Other candidates are former
Bulgarian foreign minister Irina Bokova and Ecuadorean diplomat Ivonne Baki.
