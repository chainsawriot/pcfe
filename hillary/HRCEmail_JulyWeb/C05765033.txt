                Dear Melanne,


                The US Ambassador to UNESCO is launching a fierce, ferocious, unfair campaign against the
                Egyptian candidate to UNESCO Minister Farouk Hosni.
                If Washington does not want him — for whatever reasons — this is acceptable as their choice, but
                we think the US, with its principles and weight, should be a fair partner and an objective leader.
                People here am surprised at the position of the US Ambassador. They say "We want to feel that
                change is not just a Motto but starts a new era in our relationship"

                Hosni is an open-minded person who respects all religions. He is
                accused of being Anti-Jewish. That is not true. The allegation is based
                on a quote out of context. He is translating Hebrew literature, restored
                Synagogues and is establishing a Jewish Museum. He rescued the torah
                scrolls and has the symbols of the three religions appear together in
                Video Clips, Pictures and documentaries about Egypt.


                For these, and similar reasons, the fundamental — Terrorists are against him and are the ones
                7Torkilg hard to block his election.
                                                        163
