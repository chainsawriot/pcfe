Hi Cheryl,
Just wanted to close the loop and let you know that President Clinton will address the Security Council next
week (Wed, Sept 9) in his role as UN Special Envoy for Haiti. This has not been announced / is still close
hold. Thanks for your support in moving this forward. We are excited about this session.
Brooke
