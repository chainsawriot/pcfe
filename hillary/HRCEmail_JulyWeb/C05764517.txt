                                  STATEMENT BY IAN KELLY, SPOKESMAN

                       Temporary Suspension of Non-Immigrant Visa Services in Honduras


The OAS Foreign Ministers mission is in Honduras seeking support for the San Jose Accord, which would restore the
democratic and constitutional order and resolve the political crisis in Honduras. In support of this mission and as a
consequence of the de facto regime's reluctance to sign the San Jose Accord, the U.S. Department of State is conducting a
full review of our visa policy in Honduras. As part of that review, we are suspending non-emergency, non-immigrant visa
services in the consular section of our embassy in Honduras, effective August 26. We firmly believe a negotiated solution
is the appropriate way forward and the San Jose Accord is the best solution.
