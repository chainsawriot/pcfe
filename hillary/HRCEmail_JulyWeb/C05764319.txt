Germany's Steinmeier proposes Afghan pull-out talks
BERLIN (Reuters) - German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who is bidding to oust Angela Merkel as
chancellor of Germany in September's election, said he wanted a timetable for a military pull-out from
Afghanistan. Steinmeier said once it became clear who would lead Afghanistan after the election there, talks should
begin over how long foreign troops should stay. "We need to agree with the new Afghan president...how long
international troops should remain in Afghanistan," he said at the sidelines of an election event in Dortmund on
Saturday.
