Asif Akhtar, Lahore: Urdu news channel anchors ... succeed in prompting Clinton to declare that far
from being dispatched, the money had only been set aside, and if the Pakistani people didn't want the
money they didn't have to take it. The open-ended question reduced a cackling room to pin-drop
silence, almost embarrassing the anchors for pursuing that line of questioning in the first place. It
seems none of the haughty anchors were ready to make the billion-dollar blunder by ticking off the
Secretary of State and losing all that aid money.
 Clinton handled most of the questions and concerns with a calm and a poise people would have
never expected from her predecessor Condaleeza Rice, who would have been more comfortable
carrying out the offensive without the charm.
 Given the circumstances, this attempt by a US official at bridging the gap between Pakistani
opinions and US policy is commendable.


Maryam, Lahore: We need to use our heads rather than our emotions all the time. its time to reflect
where we went wrong as a nation too.'


Ibrahim, Lahore: it was really funny to see Mrs. Clinton handling the whole bunch of media and spin
them around her little finger. Mrs. Clinton on the other hand carried herself like a true diplomat and a
leader!


Nadeem, Lahore: Clinton has showed her professionlism by engaging with the masses, someone of
them from our tribal region. this is something that our leaders lack.
