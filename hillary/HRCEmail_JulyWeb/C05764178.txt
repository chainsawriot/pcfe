They are happy to adjust to the afternoon. I am going to suggest a 3:00pm start time which should give plenty of time to
return to DC. (Cronkite service starts at 10:30am)

We will push them to adjust. They shouldn't do this without you.

Yes, Jack can have your proxy if they can't adjust the time. I will see if moving the time is an option.

I really want to go to Cronkite's service. Can we change time for MCC to late afternoon? If not, can Jack preside?
