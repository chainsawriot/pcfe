Hi Cheryl,


Just wanted to close the loop and let you know that President Clinton will address the Security Council next week (Wed,
Sept 9) in his role as UN Special Envoy for Haiti. This has not been announced / is still close hold. Thanks for your
support in moving this forward. We are excited about this session.

Brooke
