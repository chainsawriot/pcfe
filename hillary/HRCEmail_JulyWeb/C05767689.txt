Hello again,




This is the follow-up info from the IAM after Tom Buffenbarger asked me to be in touch with you about a possible visit
with their members servicing your plane(s?) Below is from Rick, who separately said such a visit need not include Tom -
- the key piece of info is that the workers cannot approach you, you'd have to reach out to them.




At Andrews AFB, IAM Local Lodge 24's President and Chief Steward is Al Nuzzo. His contact information is:
