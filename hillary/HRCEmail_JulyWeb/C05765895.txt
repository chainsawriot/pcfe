Huma: We are all horrified by this morning's suicide bombing and loss of life in Mogadishu.
Tell Allida that I have just spoken to Amb. Michael Ranneburger in Nairobi. I asked Michael to contact Asha Haji as soon
as possible to determine how we might be of assistance to her and her family. (Michael knows Asha and believes she
may be in Nairobi, but will find out asap where she is. Asha's family, husband and children, are generally resident in
Nairobi.) I've asked Michael to secure Kenyan police protection for the family while they are in Kenya and to explore
with Asha whether she is interested in looking for a way to come to the U.S. via some type of application for refugee
status. Michael will ask our consular officers to explore the options available if Asha wants to consider them.
I also alerted Michael to the fact that Asha's brother was seriously wounded in the bombing. I have asked that they get
a full name as soon as possible and to see what we can do through the TFG, the UN and AMISOM to have him flown to
Nairobi. Michael said that he and the embassy have already arranged for a private hospital in to treat the seriously
injured who are being arriving by special flights in Nairobi. If we can identify Asha's brother, we will give him priority.
Finally, Michael has spoken to Sheik Sharrif extended our condolences and encouraged his resolve. I will be speaking to
Sheik Sharrif later today.
Hope this update is useful. I will report more as I get. Johnnie

Huma, H met Asha at CGI and raised concerns about her security. She sent Asha to undersecretary Carson. They met for
an hour. Note to US embassy in Nairobi was to be sent re Asha and her family's security. Embassy won't meet with her.

Today's massacre killed her closest allies and blinded and critically wounded her brother.

Asha is last moderate leader. She is speaking out.

They want to kill her, Huma.

Please tell Hillary.

If you want I will email her.

Asha's phone #

Dick Wilbur at US Mission to UN in Geneva tried to contact embassy in Nairobi by email. No response yet.

Thanks, Allida
