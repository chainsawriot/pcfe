Beihl called me from the plane just before departure. De facto negotiating team will return to DC Wednesday for
several days talks. While ministers were discouraged by de factor regime intransigence, Beihl said that Zelaya had also
lost some support. He said that all the ministers were shocked by Zelaya's behavior in a telephone conference call just
before their press conference this afternoon. Zelaya spoke of people dying by hundreds, being thrown in jail and
tortured. Zelaya appeared to be very out-of-touch, Beihl said. He added that "even" the Argentine FM was questioning
whether Z's return was the correct course. Beihl said that while a democratic solution was needed, perhaps Zelaya was
not the right option. I again expressed our position that the problem was not who replaced Zelaya, but that he was
removed unconstitutionally.




News conference was straightforward. Only one minister spoke (I don't know them by face), said that the solution was
return to democratic order and the regime not prepared to accept Si. I haven't got hold of transcript yet, will do so
asap.




Beihl again expressed thanks for our move on visas (as well as our logistical support), saying that all the ministers
thought it a good move.
