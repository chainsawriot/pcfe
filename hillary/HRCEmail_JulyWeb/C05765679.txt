Dear Hillary

Thanks for your encouragement on NATO. I am honored that you asked me to work on this fascinating challenge.
I leave for Slovenia tomorrow for the second seminar. I then go to Prague to celebrate the Velvet revolution. Will be in touch when I
get back with another update for you to have before the ministerial and then can figure out when we meet

All best
Madeleine

Dear Madeleine,

 Thank you for your letter report to me about the excellent work you are doing. All the outreach is reassuring the Central and Eastern
members. We face some hard choices ahead and should plan to meet in December to review. I will be in Brussels for the NATO
Ministerial the first week, so let's aim for a time after that.

  All the best, Hillary
