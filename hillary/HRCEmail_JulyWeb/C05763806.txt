Subject: Meeting with Honduran de factos

To All:

We spent about 90 minutes with the four de facto representatives. I invited them to make their points first
(they often complain that people don't listen to them). They focused on the abuses Zelaya committed before
June 28, pointing out that the San Jose Accord, while'key to a solution, would not restore the institutional
damage done to Honduras.

I said that clearly the San Jose Accords were necessary but not sufficient to clean up all the broken crockery in
Honduras. But they ARE necessary — and urgent. Only by implementing the agreement can Hondurans repair
the other damage with the support of the international community — which is essential for the country's
success. I then reviewed all the carrots and sticks we discussed this morning. I cited the Secretary in
underscoring urgency. Other countries join us, I emphasized, in seeing the mixed messages coming out of
Tegucigalpa as a deliberate delaying tactic designed to move the country toward elections without
Zelaya. The United States and others are losing patience with these tactics and want to see solid commitment
to the Accord now.

The de factos acknowledged that the world perceives them as delaying and that they need to move quickly. I
said they should commit publicly to the San Jose Accord when the OAS FMs are in Honduras next week. They
said that made sense.

Then they brought up another issue. The San Jose Accord grants political amnesty but not amnesty for other
crimes. They can arrest Z for corruption as soon as he returns to the country. I pushed back hard, saying no
one — Arias, the OAS, the United States — understands the San Jose Accord as leading to Z's immediate
arrest. The understanding is that he would resume limited functions with a national unity cabinet until he
hands over power to an elected successor. To say they will arrest Z is to ensure that he does not return, and
thus the collapse of the Arias plan. They seemed to back off slightly, but this remains a problem.

We are working already with other FMs and with Arias to make sure the de factos know this is a non-starter. I
plan to call the de facto delegation chief back Wednesday to cite my conversations tonight with others in the
region and urge him again to talk to Arias directly about this.

Meanwhile, we are pocketing their promise to agree asap to the San Jose Accord.
