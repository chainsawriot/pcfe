Cheryl, regard the desire of the Economic Club of DC to invite HRC to speak (which we
consulted on a week ago), they're now broadening the invite to be any time in the fall—which
I'd think might increase the chances of it suited her purposes. I'm attaching a copy of the letter
they'll send in via any channel you designate (scheduler, public affairs officer, or whatever).
  HRC did call this weekend and we covered a pretty wide range of substantive issues. I
decided, however, not to bother her with this matter, which I hope was the right call on my part.
  Also, Jake put in a call to me last week. We didn't connect. I don't know if that's OBE as a
result of HRC's call. In any event, I'm around this week, though hanging out as much as
  ossible with

  Regards, Strobe

This sounds interesting - can you give me a few days to determine whether it's even a possibility? Sept is imp month b/c
of travel and unga but want to check.

Let's also connect on unga - glad you connected with jack et al.

Best

Cheryl, I hope for your sake that you don't get this email for a while and that you're getting
some genuine R&R. Anyway, David Rubenstein of the Carlyle Group is asking my advice on
whether HRC would welcome an invitation to address the Economic Club of Washington in
September. Obviously business-heavy. Audience: 400-500, screen questions for after talk and
he can provide them in advance; media coverage, etc. I told him I had no idea but would
check. Depending on her outreach strategy for the fall, it could be a good audience, esp. if she
wanted to talk about issues like China, the development, the role of the private sector, or
energy/climate—i.e., the econ aspect/component of foreign policy. If I should be going
elsewhere for this kind of steer, lemme know. Regards, Strobe

PS: Kemal Dervi, Judith Rodin and I connected by phone with Jack Lew, Derek Chollet &
others on State end re outside input into QDDR.
