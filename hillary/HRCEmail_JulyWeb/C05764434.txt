We were judging the candidates for the Swanee Hunt Award which goes annually to a FS0 and a FSN judged superior
for integrating women's issues into their work. T hey are nominated by ambassadors at posts or AS's here.
I called her because we had a tie for the FSO's and I wanted to see if she'd provide a second monetary award so we
wouldn't have to divide the $5k. She agreed and then told me
State will fly in the awardees and the Secry usually gives out the award. Swanee is hoping that she'll be able to come and
be there for the brief ceremony.

I thought you'd want to know.
