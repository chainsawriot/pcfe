Subject: President Arias

President Arias just called to ask about the Zelaya meeting. I gave him a readout and took him through the
statement, including word for word the part on elections.


Arias was very pleased. He even used the phrase "beginning of the end of the de facto regime." He liked our
idea of diplomatic outreach and I assured him that San Jose would be a top destination for us. He also
strongly endorsed our plan to go to Brussels, Madrid and the Vatican. He himself has spoken frequently with
the Spanish to get them to press for EU action similar to ours.


Finally, Arias was very pleased that Hugo plans to call in the candidates to get them to go to Micheletti and say
that an election outside the San Jose process is of dubious legitimacy.


I told Arias that the Secretary is very strong in her commitment to the San Jose process and Arias asked that I
give her his warm regards.
