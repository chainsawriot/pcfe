This is not a fair assessment of the position we have taken. We have more than tripled to level of assistance from what
was proposed in the last Administration and have expressed flexibility about how to structure it. Jeff has consistently
been pushing the Palauns to press for more. Kurt reached out to him per your instruction and we will get you a
complete memo.

Subject: Fw: Only Palau & Israel vote w/US in UN

As I have said repeatedly, I do not want to see Palau shortchanged. I do not know whether this assessment is accurate,
so can I pls get an update and recommendation about to take care of this?

Subject: Only Palau & Israel vote w/US in UN

         Wed., Palau was one of only two UN General Assembly members to vote with the US against a resolution calling
for an end to the US embargo of Cuba (Israel was the other). Even the two other states in free association with the US.
did not support the US position. Important officials in Palau wanted to abstain because of the drastic cut in U.S.
assistance that Alcy Frelick has insisted on but Pres. Toribiong decided to stick with the US. The proposal to cut the small
amount of assistance that Palau is receiving is ironic in light of the substantial increase in assistance pledged to the two
other freely associated states just a few years ago. It is also misinformed and misguided.
