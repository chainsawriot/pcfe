Mumbai gunman says he's ready for gallows
MUMBAI (AP) - The lone surviving gunman in the Mumbai attacks said he is ready to go to the gallows and wants no
mercy from the court for his role in one of India's worst terrorist acts which left 166 people dead. "Whatever I have
done, I have done in this world. It would be better to be punished in this world. It would be better than God's
punishment. That's why I have pleaded guilty," Ajmal Kasab, a Pakistani, told the court.
