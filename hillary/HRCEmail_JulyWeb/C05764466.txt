 Subject: Schedule and staffing

 Dear Cheryl,

 Thank you for the call on Thursday and for your understanding about my need to take care of certain
 responsibilities before I depart as SCSL Prosecutor.

 The Taylor testimony is going well from our point of view. He is opening himself to a devastating CX by
 telling unexpected and unnecessary lies about his activities in Liberia and the region. I have been using my
 access to senior Liberian, Sierra Leone, and UN officials to obtain new evidence with which to confront
 him. This is well in hand and I dont see a problem in leaving even if Taylor is still on the stand on September
 7. The major reason to stay as Prosecutor until that date (aside from the requirement of a 30-day notice to the
 UNSG) is the oral argument on the appeal of our last case in Freetown (involving historic gender violence
 convictions) on September 2, 3, and 4.

 However, from my conversations with Clint, I am concerned that there are several issues that are coming to
 head at this time, and know that I will have to hit the ground very fast on September 8. Because my schedule is
 light in the coming week and because I have some leave days to use, I have therefore planned a quick trip to DC
 to be there from Wednesday noon through Saturday noon, August 26-29. I wont yet move into the office, but
 the staff will help me schedule some informal meetings on several issues. Additionally, this will give me a
 chance to look for a place to live.




. I hope that we can talk when I am Washington this week.
