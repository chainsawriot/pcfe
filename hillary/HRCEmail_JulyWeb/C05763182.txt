Subject:                            FYI: Info on one of the Iranian hostages... Sid




               -elated some information to me about one of the young Americans being held hostage that might possibly
be helpful. This piece of information may be useful if charges are made that he is somehow a spy.                   besides
writing a book about the former president, is                                                             Shane Bauer, one of
the hostages, is a young photojournalist who is a Nation Institute grantee. He is an Arabic speaker who has a grant to
write on Middle East issues. He has written not only for The Nation but also for Christian Science Monitor, San Francisco
Chronicle, and most importantly, the Al Jazeera English speaking website. According to                  he lives in the region
most of the time, was traveling with his girlfriend in Kurdistan, has an interest in Kurdish affairs, was on a hiking trip, and
obviously and inadvertently crossed an unmarked border. He was not acting as a journalist at the time, though he is a
journalist--and a left-wing kid.
