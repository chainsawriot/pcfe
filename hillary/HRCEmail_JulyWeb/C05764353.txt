I spoke to Ann and she sd that you always have the Trustee box to use in each House.

She cannot hold a box for The Secretary of State use only not - bt can further discussions with KC on this

She advises that we need to give advance notice -

There are 4 seat in the Eisenhower that are complimentary and then 4 that would need to be purchased for nominal fee
(seems like a really silly policy) The same for Opera and in the Symphony there are 12 all complimentary. I think if we
begin to use the box on a regular basis we can work with them on the cost issues.

This could be a lovely way to serve many special guests.

Let me know if you want to begin a process of reviewing the KC calendar and start a list of recommendations to invite.
