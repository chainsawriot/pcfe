Subject                           Tuesday with Daniel Yohannes and perhaps steve radlet



Lona

Daniel Yohannes will be in town on Tuesday. Not sure how hectic HRC's day is but would be good to have her get 30
minutes with him. I am going to schedule 30 minutes with him so she can either join or we can tack time on the
backend.

In addition, I am going to connect Steve and Daniel so they can meet in person on Tuesday â€” I likely will coordinate that
so that Steve joins before or after I meet with Daniel in case HRC wants to see both.
