The Secretary's Call Sheet for
Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari

Purpose of Call: To express your condolences regarding the deaths of Iraqi MFA personnel in the August 19 attack on
the Iraqi Foreign Ministry.

III I want to personally express my heartfelt condolences to you for the savage attack on the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign
Affairs today and for the tragic loss of so many Iraqi lives around Baghdad and particularly at the Ministry of Foreign

injuries resulting from this attack, with 70% of the building damaged. In April, you were the first senior U.S. official to
hold a meeting at the MFA. Deputy Foreign Minister Labid Abbawi, who attended your meeting at the MFA and who's
wife led your meeting with Iraqi war widows, was reportedly slightly injured and quite shaken by the attack. He may

have lost a number of staff members. At this point, we do not know if other senior-ranking MFA officials were killed or
wounded in the attack.
