From POGO's website blog: A positive take on our actions thus far, as characterized by the remaining guards in Kabul.

More News From Guards on the Ground in Kabul
A quick update from the ground in Kabul: we've heard that guards at the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan are very
pleased with the State Department's actions so far, with one source saying guards feel as if they've been
"liberated from prison." State Department investigators have been conducting thorough, respectful interviews
and are not asking guards if they shared information with POGO. The right people are being fired and it looks
like we're on the way to restoring an atmosphere of professionalism at the U.S. Embassy.

The contractor who was forced out of his position, by the way, was asked to leave before the State Department
arrived on the scene. More as it comes in.

Subject: RE: New POGO story - forced resignation of whistleblower

We are now in a battle with POGO for ownership of this issue. What the Embassy today did was quite effective -
maintaining the initiative and outlining decisive actions taken. We need to continue this trend, forcing POGO to react to
what we are doing rather than the other way around. The Embassy statement does include removal of supervisors. I
wonder from a contracting and legal standpoint how to react if asked to POGO's suggestion that supervisors are not
allowed to work for another contractor. While people have a right to work, I believe we get to review a contractor's
management team and instruct them on who is acceptable or not, right? I don't necessarily buy into POGO's Nuremberg
defense, that people are exonerated because they were forced to debase themselves. But I see the release below as
good news, that we have established momentum on the issue. We should retain it even though it will become more
challenging as Congress returns next week.

POGO released the following statement on their website today:

Statement by Danielle Brian, Executive Director, Project On Government Oversight:

"POGO is pleased that the State Department has finally taken decisive steps to bring the Kabul security guard
scandal under control. We remain very concerned, however, with certain elements of this action. POGO has no
solid information of the identities of those reported to have been removed. We have been told people are being
fired for simply being in the photographs. We do know a number of those were unwilling participants.

We also want to hear that the supervisors who were responsible for this debacle are being held fully accountable
and not simply allowed to resign and go to another contractor."

Subject: New POGO story - forced resignation of whistleblower

POGO posted the attached on their website, claiming that the whistleblower who exposed the guard scandal was forced
to resign.

http://www.pogo.ordpogo-files/alerts/contract-oversight/co-gp-20090903.html


One of the whistleblowers who helped expose the guard scandal at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul has just been forced to
resign after his company—whose client is ArmorGroup, North America (AGNA)—came to believe that he had reached
out to D.C. for assistance. The company told POGO that the whistleblower's resignation was voluntary.

However, information obtained by the Project On Government Oversight (POGO) strongly suggests he was pressured
into resigning to avoid being fired, an action often referred to as constructive dismissal.

POGO is deeply concerned about the action allegedly taken against the whistleblower. He is being forced out at a time

when three of the supervisors responsible for allowing the misconduct at Camp Sullivan have been allowed to quietly
resign and escape accountability. As per our letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of September 1, 2009, POGO calls
on the State Department to take immediate action to protect both the physical and employment security of
whistleblowers who have stepped forward with allegations of serious misconduct involving ArmorGroup, North America
and others.
