I thought you meant next Sunday or Monday. What about this Wed afternoon or Thurs in DC? I told Cheryl and Philippe I
wouldn't leave early. If the Oprah team want to come out here and one of our friends is willing to let us use their house
out here this Monday, I would do that.

The dates are tomorrow or monday.
Not next week. Its why I asked cheryl to discuss with you because it meant interrupting your vacation which I wasn't
prepared to do.

But I'm leaving here on Wed and I'll be at home over the weekend so I'd rather get it over w in the morning. Can they do
it in the barn?
