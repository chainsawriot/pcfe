Seems the best for a bad situation.

Moves the public discussion from settlement freeze to final status. Keeps some pressure on the parties. And seems like you will play a
more public role, which is good. (You have more credibility on both sides than anyone).

Going forward, if Bibi continues to be the obstacle, you will need to fmd the ground from which you can make his politics uneasy. I
think you can do that even with current concerns in Israel about US posture. But it will be easier as we rebuild trust so that our future
admonitions are accepted. (An HRC trip there to reframe perceptions?).

Finally, need to be mindful of Abu Mazen's politics. Taking a lot of criticism for meeting with Bibi without settlement freeze.
