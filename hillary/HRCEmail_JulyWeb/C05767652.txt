Subject: We have a deal

The negotiators have concluded a text that has been approved by Micheletti and Zelaya. We are preparing the official
minute that will soon be signed by the negotiators. Micheletti is announcing now on the television that the deal has
been struck.

We will send more soon. The bottom line: I cannot think of another example of in Latin America where a country,
having suffered a rupture of its democratic and constitutional order, has overcome that rupture through negotiation and
without violence.

S can and should take pride that her launching of the SJA, her firm support of the OAS role, her constant outreach to the
major players, and her willingness to send us here created the conditions necessary for this accomplishment.
