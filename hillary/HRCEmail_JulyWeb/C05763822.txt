At least 13 die in Pakistan bus crash
ISLAMABAD (AP) Police say a bus has crashed in northwestern Pakistan killing at least 13 people and injuring 35. Police
officer Sardar Shah says the driver of the bus lost control Wednesday while driving on a mountain road, and the bus
veered into a ditch in the Batagram district of North West Frontier Province. He says three children are among the
dead. Shah blamed the accident on the driver's speeding as he went into a sharp turn on the road. Such accidents are
common in Pakistan, where roads are often poorly maintained and drivers regularly disregard traffic rules.
