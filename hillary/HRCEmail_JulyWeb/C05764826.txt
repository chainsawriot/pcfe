Vilsack told a powerful story about going to a school feeding program while he was in kenya in august for agoa. At lunch
time, he spooned usg donated porrage into the kids red cups. After lunch he asked the kids what their favorate part of
school was. He expected to hear "recess" or maybe reading. Instead every single child responded with "lunch - because
it is the only meal I get everyday". Vilsack was glad for what we were doing, but the event made him realize how much
more there is to do.
