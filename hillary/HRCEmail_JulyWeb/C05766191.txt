Subject: Making the Food Security video happen

Katie and Caitlin:

I know you know, but want you to know we all know as does the Secretary how without your pushing and
making it happen, there would have been no video. Katie, your constant can-do attitude, hectoring to get us
to review the concepts and the scripts, and positive attitude that it would be great truly was critical. Not to
mention your conceptual eye that bettered the outcome. Caitlin, your analysis, outreach, and notion that a
celebrity would in fact do this was so valuable.

Many thanks to you both â€” it was the highlight.
