There is a famous American movie called Field of Dreams, and in it, the hero - Kevin Costner - builds a baseball field at
his remote farm, he carves it out of his crop. Some people don't think what he's doing makes sense, they think it's a risk
- but he is a true baseball fanatic and he loves the game and he takes on the project because he keeps hearing...

"If you build it., they will come...

If you build it, they will come."

Well ladies and gentlemen, I am proud to say that we built it, and we care coming to the Shanghai World Expo
