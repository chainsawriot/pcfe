Cheryl,

In response to your query about the possibility of going to Goma, I reached out to our colleagues in Embassy Kinshasa to
see what has been done in the past. The only reasonably safe way to get to Goma is flying on a MONUC aircraft
originating from Kinshasa. That would mean a two hour flight each way, leaving a very small window (probably no more
than one hour) to work in events. Moreover, advancing Goma would pose a significant challenge for us for security
reasons.

I also asked the Embassy to look into other ways of traveling to Goma — perhaps over land via Kigali (Lew and I had
discussed this possibility earlier) — and the Embassy did not like the optics of approaching by land from another country.

We're still looking at ways to lengthen our time in Monrovia, including possibly staying overnight in another country,
such as Cape Verde. Still no luck, but we're working on it...km
