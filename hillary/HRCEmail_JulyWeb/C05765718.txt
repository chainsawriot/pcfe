November 12, 2009 - Dems Fade In Ohio Senate Race, Quinnipiac University Poll Finds; Obama Gets
Negative Score In Key Swing State


Word format

For the first time, Republican Rob Portman is inching ahead of the two Democrats in the 2010 race for Ohio's
U.S. Senate seat, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today. Also for the first time, Ohio voters
disapprove 50 - 45 percent of the job President Barack Obama is doing, down from his 53 - 42 percent approval
September 16 and 49 - 44 percent approval July 7.

In still another first, voters are split 40 - 40 percent on who is doing a better job handling health care, the
President or Congressional Republicans, the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh- pe-ack) University survey
finds. In a September 16 survey on the same question, Obama was on top 49 - 28 percent.

Ohio voters disapprove 53 - 42 percent of the way the President is handling the economy and disapprove 57 -
36 percent of the way he is handling health care. In September, they approved of his handling of the economy
48 - 46 percent and split on his handling of health care 44 - 45 percent.

"The Democratic wave that swept through Ohio in 2006 and 2008 may be cresting. The Democratic lead in the
Governor's and Senate races has evaporated and for the first time President Barack Obama is under water in the
most important swing state in the country," said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University
Polling Institute.

"Ohio voters are not happy with the President's handling of health care and the economy. The fact that they now
are split whether he or the Republicans in Congress are better able to handle health care should be a very
worrisome number at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. since the GOP is still pretty much a four-letter word in most of
America."

Independent voters, often the group that decides Ohio elections, disapprove 49 - 45 percent of the overall job
Obama is doing and disapprove 54 - 39 percent of his handling of the economy. They disapprove 62 - 34
percent, almost 2-1, of his handling of health care.

"In July, when the President's job approval began falling nationally from the high 50s and low 60s into the low
50s, Ohio was the first place it showed up in the polls," said Brown.

Portman, a former Congressman running for the U.S. Senate in 2010, has small leads over two Democrats,
topping Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner 38 - 34 percent and Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher 39 - 36 percent. In the
battle for the Democratic Senate nomination, Fisher gets 24 percent to Brunner's 22 percent, with 51 percent
undecided. Portman leads car dealer Tom Ganley 26 - 7 percent in a GOP primary with 64 percent undecided.

"None of the Senate candidates are very well known, but what is significant is that until now Democrats were
winning all the Senate matchups. Clearly there is an at least temporary swing toward the GOP in Ohio. Whether
it continues is anyone's guess," said Brown.

Ohio voters oppose Obama's health care plan 55 - 36 percent, with independents against it 57 - 33 percent. By a
61 - 35 percent margin, voters don't think Congress should approve a health care overhaul if it only gets
Democratic votes.

But Ohio voters support 53 - 40 percent giving people the option of a government health insurance plan.
Independent voters support this public option 55 - 38 percent.

Afghanistan

The United States is doing the right thing fighting in Afghanistan, Ohio voters say 48 - 43 percent. Voters
support 51 - 40 percent the recommendations of the top U.S. commanders in Afghanistan that 40,000 more U.S.
troops should be sent.

"But 55 percent of Ohioans say they are only willing to see large numbers of American troops in Afghanistan
for two years or less, which is hardly a mandate for the type of long-term commitment that the Pentagon has
said will be needed for victory," said Brown.

From November 5 - 9, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,123 Ohio voters, with a margin of error of +/- 2.9
percentage points. The survey includes 406 Republicans and 394 Democrats, each with a margin of error of +/-
4.9 percentage points.

Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-CT) is still in serious trouble in his re-election race with 53% of voters saying he does not
deserve re-election, a new Quinnipiac poll finds.

Connecticut voters disapprove, 54% to 40%, of the job Dodd is doing, compared to a 49% to 43% disapproval in
September.

In general election match ups, Dodd loses to both Rob Simmons (R), 49% to 38%, and to Linda McMahon (R), 43% to
41%.
