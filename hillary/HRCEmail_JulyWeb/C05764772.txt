Subject: (AP) Afghanistan: UN-backed fraud panel member resigns

KABUL - (AP) A member of a U.N.-backed panel set up to investigate election fraud complaints resigned today, blaming
what he called "the interference of foreigners." One of two Afghans on the Electoral Complaints Commission (Maulavi
Mustafa Barakzia) alleges that the three foreigners on the panel, one American, one Canadian and one Dutch, were
"making all decisions on their own" without consultation.
