I don't see             in this role as much as women's roles and rights which I'd like to do dinner on in early              B5
September.

I'd like to add a community college leader like                                          whom I know well or someone
else you can identify. Jill Biden gave a well-received speech about comm coils in Paris before a big international audience
and generated a lot of interest.

Also a lot of the higher ed in the developing world is church based and funded. The Methodists have started a large
university in Africa. There are other examples like the college in Lahore Lugar mentioned to me. We should have a rep of
this segment of higher ed operating in other countries.

And            ..works for the fastest growing college network in the world, Laureate Universities, started by Doug Becker
who Bill likes a lot. It's a for-profit model that should be represented.

Also one of the real world problems is getting more students into the US to study. Our typical costs are prohibitive. Beria
College in Kentucky,                               charges no tuition but requires all students to work and attracts a lot    B6
of foreign students.

HRC:




Below is the recommended guest list for the August 17 Education Dinner. I solicited input from Nina F, AMS, and John. I
think it's a good list but you should look through it â€” it's long (19) b/c there likely will be a large number who will not be
available in August given the academic calendar. We will work our way down it to get 12-14 outside attendees leaving
about 6 seats for State.




The guest list includes university and college presidents, scholars, public intellectuals and journalists who have thought
creatively about the role higher education is playing and could play as part of "smart diplomacy".




Once you sign off on this guest list for invitations (so add or subject any), I will work with Anne-Marie to discuss format
and assignments for folks for speaking.
