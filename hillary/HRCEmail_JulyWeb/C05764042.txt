She should also wish the PM Mazel Toy on his new grandson, just born within the last day or so.

o          The goal is clear: to bring an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and to resolve the open disputes
and claims between the parties, including the territorial and security issues addressed by UN Security Council
Resolution 242 and 338, by reaching realistic, effective, and enduring agreements and arrangements which will
enable two states to live side by side in peace and security—the state of Israel with secure and recognized
borders and an independent and territorially and economically viable Palestinian state. Without prejudice to
the location of borders, the land being discussed is the territory occupied in 1967.

•          It is understood that this will be achieved through direct bilateral negotiations which will resolve
previously identified issues such as security, borders, settlements, refugees, Jerusalem, relations, and
cooperation with other neighbors as well as other issues of common interest. The U.S. will play an active and
sustained role in supporting the parties in this effort. The parties will need to: agree on the conduct of the
negotiations, reach the necessary agreements and arrangements, and ultimately attain their long awaited mutual
reconciliation.
