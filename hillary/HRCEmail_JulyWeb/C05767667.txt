Subject:                           Only Palau & Israel vote w/US in UN




       Wed., Palau was one of only two UN General Assembly members to vote with the U.S against a
       resolution calling for an end to the US embargo of Cuba (Israel was the other). Even the two
       other states in free association with the US. did not support the US position. important officials
       in Palau wanted to abstain because of the drastic cut in.U.S. assistance that Alcy Frelick has
       insisted on but Pres. Toribiong decided to stick with the US. The proposal to cut the small
       amount of assistance that Palau is receiving is ironic in light of the substantial increase in
       assistance pledged to the two other freely associated states just a few years ago. It is also
       misinformed and misguided.
