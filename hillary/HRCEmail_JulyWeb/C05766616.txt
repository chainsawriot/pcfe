Hi Cheryl — hope you had a great Thanksgiving!

At the retreat last week, S told me she really hoped I could go to the OSCE Ministerial with Jim S next week. I
told her I'd check with H, given that I could be announced soon.

I just found out on Wednesday that it's likely I'll be announced early next week, so I've told Jim I won't be
going with him (much as I'd like to...).

Best, Ian

Ian —

Our nominations wallah — perhaps you have met him already, Miguel Rodriguez — agrees with my gut that, if
you are announced before the trip next week, you should probably send someone else in your place. Even
though your day job gives you every reason to go, as soon as you are public you want to avoid any gesture that
a Senator could interpret as presuming advice and consent.

Matt
