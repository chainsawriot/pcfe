Below is the update as of last night. But I'm trying to see what else we can do to help expedite. I talked to     last
night and she said          was in touch with 2 state department staff yesterday and was grateful for their assistance and   B6
for constantly staying in touch.
Getting u an update from today but as of last night:

                                                                                                                             B6

                                There has been very close coordination among Consular Affairs, Embassy Kathmandu
and Consulate Chengdu.                                                                                                       B6
