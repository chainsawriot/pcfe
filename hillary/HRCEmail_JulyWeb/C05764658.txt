Huma, Joe, Jake,

We are likely to have one candidate against Hosni in round 4 of the UNESCO director general race on Monday.

EU Commissioner Ferraro-Waldner has pulled out formally.

Our UNESCO Amb. Killion reports that candidates Baki (Ecuador) and Bukova (Bulgaria) met Sunday night Paris time.
Baki has given Bukova an ultimatum. Either they form a unity ticket with Ivonne Baki on top or Baki leaves the race.

Tonight former Ferrero-Waldner supporters are considering how to vote. Mexican Dep Secretary for 10 issues called
me. They are wondering whether to support Baki in round 4 now that F-W is out.

I noted that we wanted the strongest of the ladies to stay in (Fyi, they both were on our list of the most qualified
candidates.) Too early a pull out could also affect the race.

The Egyptian candidate could lose because of a consolidation of alternative candidates.

I am sorry to report that the Egyptians have used harsh tactics in the halls of UNESCO. A member of the U.S. delegation
has seen a member of the Egyptian-hired "public relations" group walking around with an envelope of cash. They
pushed to have two Amb recalled. Disgust and resentment is running high.

The Egyptians are pushing delegations very hard. FM Aboul-Gheit has stopped in Paris to deal with the UNESCO race
while en route to NY for UNGA.

A/S Feltman writes that Egyptian Ambassador Shoukry has called him twice today with a "message from the Foreign
Minister." FM Aboul Gheit is angry and reports President Mubarak is angry.

A/S Feltman notes " maybe we've become a convenient excuse." A/S Feltman very helpfully pushed back and helped
defend our ambassador who had been criticized.


Our strategy relies on our Amb being low-key. He is following his instructions. We should be unhappy with the way he is
being attacked personally. Candidates Bukova and Baki are moving ahead on their own lobbying. FYI, Hosni even said
on French TV that the U.S. is neutral reflecting our especially low key approach this past week. Now that Hosni may
lose, the U.S. looks like a convenient one to blame.

Events will continue to develop among the candidates and voting delegations. The Monday 9am Paris time Europeans'
meeting could indicate Bukova's relative support and offer a chance to reveal any Baki-Bukova deal if there is one.
Meanwhile Egyptian pressure is likely to continue at UNESCO on Monday.

Monday's vote is midday EDT.

Esther
