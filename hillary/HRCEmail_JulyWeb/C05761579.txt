Cheryl

Have talked to David and he and I are having a longer conversation tomorrow/Wednesday

Have arrange a nice office for him and his personal assistant; his two staffers will be right across the corridor co-located
with the EEB office that does energy.

EEB is also taking steps to pull out of that office those personnel who do sanctions and any other non-energy related
matters and both physically move them so that the energy folks and David's pair are grouped together but also so that
the residual unit contains only energy people

Regards

pat
