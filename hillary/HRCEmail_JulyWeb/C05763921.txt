Subject:                             Re: Questions



o Is the 50k figure State and AID?
YES [U/S Kennedy & Ops]




o Re Sudan: how do you pronounce Abyei? What is % and dollar increase in
2010 budget for ops and aid?

Per the VoA pronunciation guide: ab-YAY (Ops). The FY09 base level for Sudan assistance programs is $327m vs $403m
in FY10- mostly related to infrastructure and election/referendum requirements. This does NOT include several hundred
million dollars of food aid and other humanitarian assistance that is also provided yearly (close to $400m on top of
numbers
below) a year. Also in addition is funding for UN peacekeeping missions- also nearly $200m a year [D(L)]




o I don't understand the answer to the prostitution policy question. What's the simplest way to say it?

[Per D(L): Because of the politics of health care reform on the Hill, there is great sensitivity about addressing the
substance of these issues at this time.]

Q: Under the previous Administration organizatioris receiving HIV\AIDs funds from the U.S. Government were required
to have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking. Is that going to continue to be the policy of this
Administration?

A: This matter has been the subject of litigation - outside groups have sued both USAID and the HHS over the policy -
and we recently notified the Court that we needed additional time to review the policy. That review is underway; no
final decisions have been made.
