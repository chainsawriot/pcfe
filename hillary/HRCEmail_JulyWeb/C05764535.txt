  SUBJECT: DEMARCHE/LETTER PRIOR TO AUGUST 28 UNASUR SUMMIT

  REF: A. STATE 86734
       B. STATE 82581

  1. (SBU) This is an action request, see paras 4 and 5.

  2. (SBU) On August 14, the USG and Colombian government
  provisionally agreed ad referendum to the text of a bilateral
  Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA) (septel). We expect the
  final agreement may be signed in Bogota in about a month,
  following a final review by both sides. As noted in reftels,
  the DCA would permit the United States access to several
  Colombian military bases and facilitate effective bilateral
  cooperation on security matters in Colombia. It would not/not
  authorize establishment of any U.S. bases or ports, nor would it
  result in an overall increase in the number of U.S. military
  personnel or U.S.-citizen civilian contractors in Colombia.

  3. (SBU) On August 18, the Secretary and Colombian FM Jaime
  Bermudez met in Washington to discuss the DCA, including the
  importance of coordinating our public affairs and diplomatic
  strategies (septel to follow). There is some concern that the
  upcoming Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) summit would
  become a regional referendum on the DCA. Colombian President
  Alvaro Uribe will attend the summit provided that a full range
  of regional security matters can be discussed, not just the DCA.
  In this context, we are reaching out to selected
  UNASUR members to ask that they raise
  other regional security issues beyond the DCA.

  4. (SBU) Action requested for Santiago, Asuncion, and
  Lima: that you find an opportunity prior to the August 28

 summit to raise the importance of discussing the full
 range of regional security topics during the summit, and
 not merely the DCA, with appropriate high levels of host
 government.

 5. (SBU) Action requested for all: that Ambassadors to UNASUR
 member states deliver the attached letter from the
 Secretary to host governments in advance of the August 28
 summit.

 6. (SBU) Begin text:

 Dear Mr./Madam Minister:

 I wanted to take a moment to write to you and your
 colleagues about the upcoming summit of the Union of South
 American Nations (UNASUR), scheduled for August 28 in
 Bariloche. UNASUR provides an important forum to address
 the issues and challenges that affect the region. The
 United States supports the formation and effective
 functioning of regional groups such as UNASUR. They
 promote stability, cohesion, and leadership on key issues,
 and ensure the best possible communication between nations.




  We are committed to being as forthcoming as possible in
  addressing concerns about this bilateral agreement with
  nations in the region, and we have endeavored to do so in
  recent weeks through a variety of mechanisms. As concerns
  or questions arise, I hope that you will feel free to
  reach out to us to seek clarification.

  The UNASUR summit provides a unique opportunity for the

 organization to address a range of security issues that
 affect the hemisphere, and I salute your leadership for
 deciding to discuss these matters. The security
 challenges affecting our hemisphere, and your nations in
 particular, are pressing and grave. Our firm belief is
 that a collective and collaborative approach to these
 matters is essential. It is our commitment to work with
 UNASUR nations to help address these concerns.

 Sincerely yours,

 Hillary Rodham Clinton
