It'f,1 the   Coratztion, Stupid

Rep. Jane Harman

In rnr...ent weeks, prominent American politicians and columnists have begun debating troop levels in
Afghanistan. Some call for a complete withdrawal, while others favor increasing the number of U.S. troops.

The size of U.S. forces in Afghanistan is a critical issue, but a debate about troop strength misses the point.
Unless and until one other problem is addressed, neither more troops nor fewer troops will reverse the tide of
terrorism being fomented in Afghanistan or improve our national security.

It I he corruption, sturici.

Eliminating corruption in Afghanistan is in both that nation's interest and ours. From the Afghan perspective, an
honest government would give the people a genuine say in the direction of their country. For us, it would
dramatically increase our national security, both because it would increase the effectiveness of our efforts to
fight the Taiiban and because the end result would be an Afghan population more invested in taking on the fight
themselves. That is our real objective.

Wrion I traveled tc P..tgrianistan in April with Sen. Jon Kyl, Arizona Republican, we were warned by opposition
candidates that the country's presidential election would be marred by widespread fraud. They were right. On
top of everything else that we have learned about the Afghan government, the vote that took place on Aug. 20
was a sham. Every indication. is that the election results have been completely skewed by widespread,
sys..fematic

Afghan politics have never been particularly clean -- money, power and position traditionally have been traded
for support. from tribal and ethnic blocs. But evidence of fraud in last month's election is colossally disturbing:
Voter cards were bought and sold freely in the run-up to the vote, precinct workers arrived at dawn to find
baiht boxes stuffed fill], some dastricts recorded more votes than there were registered voters, and nationwide
voter registrt*c.:,:il. sumassed the number of eligible voters. by as much as 5 million. The Electoral Complaints

Commission, appointed by President Hamid Karzai, has received more than 2,000 reports of violations,
hundreds of which would have the potential to alter the election's outcome if proved true.

But electoral fraud is merely a symptom of a much graver problem plaguing the country -- the failure to
establish good governance. Pervasive corruption infects all levels of the Afghan government. Tribal elders in
Kandahar told us they were so fed up with the Karzai government that they would join the Taliban if better
governance could not be achieved.

This election is a chilling reminder of what's at stake. Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal appears to understand this.
His emphasis on joint civilian-military efforts to improve governance is much needed, but the American people
deserve some accountability. Congress should not even be asked about more troops without first being shown
evidence that some anti-corruption metrics have been achieved, not just announced.

The U.S. military's mission will be undermined so long as the Afghan government fails to govern. That's what's
happening right now.

A recent poll found 83 percent of Afghans think their country needs to change direction. Lowering that
disapproval number should be a key ingredient in any measure of governance; public opinion is essential in
judging whether the government .ass earned the people's trust. That's what a successful counterinsurgency effort
is really about: giving Afghans faith in their institutions and developing a willingness to cooperate with and
protect them. Public opinion should be gauged on a province-by-province basis to help assess where
government is sneceeding and w!nere it is not.

But change mast start at the top. If the sham election stands and Mr. Karzai remains president, he must
drastically ehange his personal poiiLics. He has preserved his position of power through a series of politically
expedient bur. morally repugnant alliances. This includes turning a blind eye to Helmand province, where his
brother, A:hiller' Vv al Karzai, has became a legendary and detested figure. The Karzais deny Ahmed Wali's
involvement in the heroin trade -- Helmand is the world's primary producer -- but don't quarrel that he is in the
"transportation, 'ausimms."

Hamid Karzai also cut a deal that reimposed Shariah law on Afghanistan's Shi'ite population, which returned
women the; -teadiiionai role nranerty, with girls sold as brides and women legally required to "submit" to
their husbaaCts' !nnotal needs.

In his bid to nam re-election. Mr. Kauai welcomed back from exile the warlord -- and accused war criminal --
Abdul            Dostum and chose as a running mate Mohammad Qasim Fahim, one of Afghanistan's major
narco-trati.i einers

Mr. :Karzai. canny: be allowed to earl his government as a "family business." Distancing himself from these
relatiens.a46 noankt will cost       noliticalAy, but failure to implement reforms will produce a far worse


Success Aia-k.ainistaii CS3041tia1.; the United States has invested too many troops and too much treasure to
fail. But iniseeg .11:â€˜c.:r levels is the wrong place to start the discussion of how to move forward. Better
governance is tae right place. That way the additional troops will be Afghans. It is their fight, and they should
constitute the overvihelming majority of the forces fighting to protect their country.
