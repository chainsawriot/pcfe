Subject: South Korea's Lee meets North Korean delegation (AP)


 SEOUL, South Korea (AP) An official says South Korea's president is meeting a visiting high-level delegation from North
Korea amid signs of warming ties on the divided peninsula. A presidential Blue House official says talks between
President Lee Myung-bak and the delegation from Pyongyang are being held at the president's office Sunday morning.
The North Korean delegation flew to Seoul on Friday to pay respects to former President Kim Dae-jung who died last
week. Their visit provided a rare opportunity for dialogue between the two Koreas, whose relations have been largely
frozen since Lee took office last year with a tougher line on the North. Speaking on condition of anonymity citing
government policy the official says she could not provide further details.
