5: Madam FM

N-M: Hi Hillary, Madam Secretary

S: Hi, can you hear me?

N-M: Yes, I can hear you but the line is very poor

5: I wanted to reach out to you today. I hope you're doing well

N-M: Thank you. I wanted to come to New York, but it was impossible....

S: I wanted to talk with you about the Human Rights Council.. I think as you know, we decided to join it so that we
could be actively involved and would be able to solve some of these issues. We have been working very closely with the
Egypt and the OIC on resolution for freedom of expression. We have agreement and then at last minute we were told
that saw wanted to change the wording which would break down consensus. Can we avoid this?

N-M: We will do whatever we can to keep our good relations. We are already happy about the way things have been so
far. On the issue, we totally agree with you, and thank you for the call. We fully agree with you but we must not block
the passing of the resolution;

S: Could I call you right back? I understand the concern that your delegation expressed about offensive speech is one
that others share. There is a separate consideration going on about that. We had hoped with Egypt as partner we could
to have a strong resolution and then we could get back to the other issues.

N-M: Therefore it must be allowed to and then whatever      we must allow the resolution to be passed. For that it must
be allowed to pass without the vote.

S: What I would like to do is to understand whether there is a way we could allow this agreed upon language to go
forward, and then work together on your concerns. Is that possible?

N-M: I was saying to you that we are elated that you are backing the HRC, and we appreciate the amount of work you
are doing and the initiative you have undertaking with Egypt. We don't have too much reservation about the

resolution. Hate speech was one of the issues of apartheid, the issue around hate is protected by our
constitution... ...the work you have undertaken... We want the resolution to go through. We do appreciate the work
you are doing. On the whole, the issue of the hate language is quite sentimental and has been protected in our
constitution because of where we come from.

5: I understand the importance. If you would work with us to allow us to pass the resolution that is currently pending,
then we could work with you to focus on the areas of hate speech. That would have a combined impact to make it
powerful. What we've done with Egypt and the OIC is a first, and when we heard that South Africa would not pass the
resolution, we were worried that it would undermine the efforts that we're making on the Human Rights Council.

N-M: If it can go through without the vote. It's our constitution and our history, that we take the issue about hate
speech very seriously. I'm agreeing with you now, to find a way to have the resolution go through, without the vote

S: There are a number of things I want to talk with you about this was most urgent. I will report that back. I appreciate
the cooperation. Let's schedule a call in the next week to go over other issues.

N-M: Let's talk again in the next week.

S: I look forward to it. Thanks very much, good luck.
