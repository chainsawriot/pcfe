Huma,

There has been strong movement to Bukova today.

Baki is expected to pull out before 4th round at noon our time. The 4th round would end up as final round with Hosni-
Bukova (Bulgaria) contest.




French Unesco ambassador told our Unesco Anb Killion that France has informed Egypt that they will not support
Hosni.

France (Quai and Elysee agree) is now openly working for Bukova. Kouchner may try to call S.

African support appears to be moving to Bukova. Amb Killion has received a series of calls from African ambassadors as
they want credit.

We are talkng at Unesco in. Paris and with capital delegations arriving in New York. Key votes: Chile, Phillipines,
Argentina, Columbia, Azerbaijan, Mexico.

Esther
