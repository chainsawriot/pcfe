H: The NYU Center on Law and Security, (where I remain associated as a senior fellow), has doen the work on terrorism
trials, especially in NY. The Center is closely involved with the NYPD terrorism unit; Mike Sheehan, whom you remember
as director of counterterrorism at State in the Clinton administration and at NYPD terrorism unit, is at the Center as a
fellow. Key statistic to cite:
What Kind of Results Can We Expect?
The New York City conviction rate for individuals charged with terrorism when it involved a US target
is 100%.

                                                     SECURITY
                                                 PRESS RELEASE
                                        Attorney General Eric Holder today
                                        announced the transfer of five
                                        detainees to the Southern District
                                        of New York. He expressed
                                        confidence in the ability of the US
                                        courts and specifically the
                                        Southern District of New York to
                                        get prosecutions for these
                                        individuals. Here's Why -
                                        According to the Terrorism Trial
                                        Report Card of the NYU Center on
                                        Law and Security, the following
                                        findings suggest a strong record

                            for prosecuting terrorism.
                            According to Karen Greenberg,
                            executive Director of the Center on
                            Law and Security at NYU School of
                            Law, "Fears that the trials of these
                            high value detainees are likely to
                            falter in the courts are unfounded
                            given the historical record."

                            See: Record of NYC Terrorism
                            Trials; Record of US DOJ
                            Terrorism Trials.

                            Why the federal courts?
                            The conviction rate for federal
                            prosecutions of terrorism suspects
                            after 9/11:
                            88% overall and approximately
                            94% for 2006 and 2007.
                            (Federal conviction rate for federal
                            felonies overall is 92%)

                            Why New York?
                            In addition to it being the "scene of
                            the crime" as Attorney General
                            Holder described it, New York has
                            been the venue for more terrorism
                            cases than any other jurisdiction.
                            (see TTRC).

                            What Kind of Charges Can We
                            Expect?
                            Terrorism Charges - 2332a, plus
                            2339 a and b (material support and
                            murder charges).

                             What Kind of Results Can We
                             Expect?
                             The New York City conviction rate
                             for individuals charged with
                             terrorism when it involved a US
                             target is 100%.

                             Please see the attached Highlights
                             from the 2001-2009 Terrorist Trial
