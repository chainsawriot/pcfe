Relatively positive feedback. Some concern over the increased engagement and lingering concern over Scott's previous
comments. If he sticks to the agreed upon points tomorrow at the presser and in the follow up with the NGOs, think the
roll out will be well received, even with Friday nite's leak.

The additional calls to be made today by Susan and Scott are listed below. It is our understanding that all these calls
were made (though a couple of house members were unavailable). We have also been in touch with all leadership and
key committee staff in the house and senate and sent them the relevant fact sheet/white paper on the new policy.

Gration: Lowey. Ros-Lehtinenn Lee. Capuano® McCaul. Isakson■ Corker. Brownback. Wolf
