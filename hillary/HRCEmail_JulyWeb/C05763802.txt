I'll call him this week. I think we have this largely sorted.

Jeff and I go back to Puerto Rico and Guam in the primaries.

Subject: Palau offended by US positions

Below is the statement of very impressive Palau reps at the end of a session of required meetings on the next phase of
free association aid. FYI only, the Palauans were insulted by the nature and depth of the response to their proposal as
well as the content and the overall approach. They are even privately questioning the relationship. (This hasn't affected
their intent to take the Uighurs.) I will send a few further thoughts.

At the conclusion of yesterday's meeting, the Palau delegation caucused to discuss its reaction to the response of the
United States delegation to the proposals that it made in June in Washington D.C., and expanded upon in subsequent
communications.



While the Palau delegation has agreed to respond to certain additional questions raised by the United States delegation
on specific elements of the Palau proposal, and further has agreed to participate in certain working groups on specific
issues, the Palau delegation was deeply disappointed with the response of the United States delegation. The United
States delegation did not seriously respond, as required by the Compact, to the operational requirements of the
Government of Palau or to Palau's comprehensive and considered plans to achieve economic advancement and self-
sufficiency.



In light of the foregoing, the Palau delegation has determined that it must now return to Palau to discuss with President
Toribiong the next steps that Palau needs to take regarding the Compact. Thank you. .
