o Is the 50k figure State and AID?
YES [U/S Kennedy & Ops]




o Re Sudan: how do you pronounce Abyei? What is % and dollar increase in
2010 budget for ops and aid?

Per the VoA pronunciation guide: ab-YAY (Ops). The FY09 base level for Sudan
assistance programs is $327m vs $403m in FY10- mostly related to
infrastructure and election/referendum requirements. This does NOT include
several hundred million dollars of food aid and other humanitarian
assistance that is also provided yearly (close to $400m on top of numbers
below) a year. Also in addition is funding for UN peacekeeping missions-
also nearly $200m a year. [D(L)]




o I don't understand the answer to the prostitution policy question. What's
the simplest way to say it?

[Per D(L): Because of the politics of health care reform on the Hill, there
is great sensitivity about addressing the substance of these issues at this

Q: Under the previous Administration organizations receiving HIV\AIDs funds
from the U.S. Government were required to have a policy explicitly opposing
prostitution and sex trafficking. Is that going to continue to be the
policy of this Administration?

A: This matter has been the subject of litigation - outside groups have sued
both USAID and the HHS over the policy - and we recently notified the Court
that we needed additional time to review the policy. That review is
underway; no final decisions have been made.
