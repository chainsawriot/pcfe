Cheryl,
Hope you are well and had a nice Easter. Had a terrific trip to Middle East...boy, is the Secretary a hit
there!
Good news.... Heather Samuelson has informed me that I have
                                                      Everything has been submitted and I am hoping that
I can be thru the process by May 7 in order to go to the NPT review conference in NY. Hopefully
       will be confirmed by then, too.
Sharon Hardy has arranged for me to come to State on Wednesday at 10 am to get my security badge
and DS briefing. I will have a temporary office in the Transition area until I am confirmed.
Do you have some time Wednesday morning...or can we have lunch? I'd like to hear how the
situation is flushing out and go over some ideas/issues with you. I'm leaving town Thursday for a long
weekend on what expect will be my last Congressional break.
All the best,
Ellen
