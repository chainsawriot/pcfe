Many thx for your kind note. I wish I felt better about Iraqis as a result, but I truly remain worried about these people.
They are truly a collective pain in the neck. Chris

Dear Chris--

 I heard about the election law passing and the agreement about Kirkuk, which sound like positive steps forward.
Thanks to you and your team for all you did to support the Iraqis in these decisions. Kudos all around. Take care, Hillary
