Fyi from Jose re mayor villaraigosa who offered to help raise for shanghai:

"Antonio did say that he has not heard from Secy since election. I wonder how feasible it would be to get her to call him
to thank him for his commitment to help? I think he can easily raise $2m. "

Had good meeting with Antonio Villaraigosa this morning. He is totally supportive and commited to help raise money
and sponsor an LA presence. He totally got it. Do you know Jay Carson, his press guy? He was one of our campaign press
hands. Also, his head of Intl, Dario, says he worked with you at WH legis affairs. Antonio did say that he has not heard
from Secy since election. I wonder how feasible it would be to get her to call him to thank him for his commitment to
help? I think he can easily raise $2m. This is the figure we talked about. His competitiveness got going when I told him
that Henry Cisneros is helping raise $1M in little ole San Antonio...

On my way to Houston tomorrow to meet with leaders there Fri morning...

We should figure out a NY strategy. With Tx, Ca & Ny, we have strong geographic balance.
