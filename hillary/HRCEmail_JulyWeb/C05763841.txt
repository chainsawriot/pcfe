I spoke with both Kurt and Jeff about Jim's paper on Dai, which Huma has. Both were very impressed but had a number
of substantive thoughts.

                                                                        They would cast the point in a different way,
which they are thinking through.




Kurt says that he will talk to Jim and then perhaps provide his own thoughts in a paper to you.

Meanwhile, I have asked Derek to do something resembling "debate on a page," to distill the key points and objectives
into a single short document that can serve as a cribsheet and help you avoid the crushing burden of the paper in the
binder.

We are prepared to keep refining and improving the paper thru the weekend.
