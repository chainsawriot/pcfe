Cheryl: The Russians are trying to cash in on Angola's upside potential. With the Angola's oil and mineral wealth, as
well as its vast agricultural potential, the Russians see dollars signs in their eyes. I hope some American companies,
backed up with OPIC and Ex-Im Bank guarantees and loans, will go in to build housing and other infrastructure.

ANGOLA TO RECEIVE $500 MILLION INVESTMENT FROM RUSSIA
(SBU) Russian state-owned mining company Alrosa will build homes, schools, and dams in addition to
partnering with Angola's petroleum company Sonangol on exploration, according to press. The Angola desk
notes the investment occurs as Angola attempts to diversify away from Chinese foreign investment. Embassy
Luanda comments this is Russia's first entry into the oil and gas sector. (Ops/Angola desk telcon,
