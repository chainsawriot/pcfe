Family has asked for there not to be a state funeral. Suggestion is that we send a representative and that our
ambassador might be best choice.

All,

EAP is still waiting on confirmation on whether former Philippines President Aquino's funeral will be a private affair or
whether it will be necessary to send a presidential delegation.

In preparation for a presidential delegation, EAP has recommended the following individuals to serve as delegates.

Let me know if anyone should be added or removed from this list.




1) George Schultz, former Secretary of State (to head delegation)

2) Sen Richard Lugar

3) Sen Daniel Inouye

4) Amb Michael Armacost: currently a fellow at Stanford, served as Ambassador to the Philippines from 1982-1984
