Mullen did better than Eikenberry -- Holbrooke's we know it when you see it test is not helping. Need to tell a more
compelling story of what we hope to accomplish in terms of civilian effort a.k.a. nation building. The standard needs to
be more modest than open ended and sustainable in a context where US military presence is not a long term
requirement if afghan army and police can be built up.

We have not thought about having any press on my trip, should we? Goal would be to show getting civilians in the right
place at the right time and reliance on leveraging small number of us civilians to deploy large number of afghans. On the
other hand not sure what we will find on the ground.
