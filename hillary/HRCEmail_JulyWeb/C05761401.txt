Cheryl,

Thanks again for your efforts in sorting out Bob Einhorn's position. He is doing excellent work on Iran, and will be a big
asset on Pakistan nuclear issues too.

I called Ellen this afternoon to brief her on the Lavrov talks, and she mentioned that Bob has kept in close touch with her
on his Iran work.                                                 It will be great to have her here.

Have a good weekend.

Bill
