Subject: Armor Group update

On Monday, DS will be ordering Armor Group to terminate 4 more individuals from the Kabul contract. The terminations
are a direct result of the investigation, as there is clear evidence that all 4 were either involved in or aware of events that
violated expectations for appropriate conduct, while serving in a supervisory capacity. They are all being terminated for
violating the standards of conduct clause.

The terminations are being handled to ensure that there are no gaps in coverage of essential positions (which may delay
the departure of one from Kabul for a few days).

DS is putting together press guidance on the terminations.




Will give you more details as we get them.

Maya
