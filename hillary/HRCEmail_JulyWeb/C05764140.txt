Subject: CORRECT UPDATED VERSION FOR S -- NOTE ON MOBILE INITIATIVES

All,


Yesterday Secretary Clinton asked for our Mobile Initiatives update (this would have been a part of one of the
presentations in the Af/Pak session but was canceled due to time).

Sean Misko may have sent an old version up, but this is the one reviewed by Holbrooke that should go to S. It also
includes a significant update on our mobile banking programs that was not in the original draft.


Please pass this to the Secretary. Also attached are a memo on the cell phone expansion by ISAF â€” which was started by
Ashley Bommer's initiatives -- in the spring and an economist report on mobile technologies in emerging markets that
features the key Afghan telecom partner whose mobile payment program is described in the memo.

Best,


Vikram
