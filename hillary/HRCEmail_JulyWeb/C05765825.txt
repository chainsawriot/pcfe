Madam Secretary,

Thank you so much. It is very exciting to finally see the book in print (when I first got a copy I was almost afraid to look
inside it!). I hope you enjoy it. And yes, I have been working with Lissa and others on the democracy/human rights
speech.

On the question about UK soldiers - the UK lost more soldiers in the Falklands than they have in Afghanistan:

  255 in the Falklands
  235 in Afghanistan (including British forces personnel and MOD civilians)

Please let me know if you would like any other information on that.

Again, thank you so much, and Happy Thanksgiving!

Sincerely,
Mike

Dear Mike---

 Congrats on your book; you must be very excited to see it in print after so much work. I'm looking forward to reading it.
And I hope you're working on the democracy/human rights speech I'm giving the week of the 7th. Are you?

 Also, David Miliband told me that the UK lost more soldiers in the Falklands than they have in Afghanistan. Would you
pls verify that for me? Thx.

  All the best, and Happy Thanksgiving! Hillary
