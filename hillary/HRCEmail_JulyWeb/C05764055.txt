hope you are well. i sopied ou in on a little email i sent to III. he got screwed ovc.
with :          . just like                and countless others...

the pictures will help. you will see that they haVe a group of sexual predators, deviants ruftil
rampant over there. no, they are not jamming guys in the ass per say, but they are shay/C.1;
judgenment. i think guys in this business are pretty much some of the best and some of (kw
worst. it is the companies responsibility to prtect the good from the bad until they show
ugly heads and can be removed. in this case the ugly ones are running the damn thing or in
case of joe ordonna are too clueless to recognize the truth or has no power to change it.

in the event M fails to inform you. peeing on people, eating potato chips out of ass cracks.
vodka shots out of ass cracks (there is video of that one), broken doors after driiken bravrlf;
threats and intimidation from those leaders participating in this activity.: people have 1-.)
terminated, like because he would not play their games and his slip up gave then
to get rid of him.

 i know this entire thing is going to make life less,bearable over there for all of us. i'll
 alcohol to some sane, accountable leadership. i am heading back on wed p.m. before !(
 want you to know that their are some good people over there doing great work. we are it;).
 scouts but there should be some exectation of professionalism in ones leadership. AGNA
 been blind to all this and those good people are getting worn out and chewed up over it all.
 way the DOS has turned their backs to the guys on the ground and let the prostitution and g;,
 shit continue. (note: i have not spoken to them, but i know over all this time someone had to
 drop that dime.)
