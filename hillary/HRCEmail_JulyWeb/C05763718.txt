All,

Per m discussions with CDA Dinger and Michelle Bernier-Toth, I just called                  and relayed the news that
          deportation is in the works. I couched it with plenty of caveats, but told her I hoped we could call her on
Sunday with good news. She understands
she doesn't want to jeopardize the deportation.

Colin - we have draft press guidance lined up for when he's wheels up and               has been notified - we want her to
hear the news from us, not cnn. Can we count on webb's office to respect that?

All,

Burmese authorities have informed us that John Yettaw will be deported and allowed to fly out on Senator Jim Webb's
military flight on Sunday afternoon, 8/16 at 1:30 p.m. I have been asked to attend a reading of Yettaw's deportation
order at Insein Prison earlier that morning at 9:00 a.m. I will then accompany Yettaw on the Senator's flight to Bangkok.

I've been in touch with Lora Lund in Bangkok about this and about logistics once we land there. She will meet us at the
airport. We plan on bringing Yettaw back to ACS/Bangkok as soon as we leave the airport so that he can call his wife and
for us to discuss options for his return to the U.S.



                                                                                                                    Lora will
make guest house reservations just in case.

Per discussion with my Charge d'Affaires (who is traveling with the Senator), we have not notified                 of this
plan. As of now, the plan is for our Vice Consul, Hayward Alto, to call her as soon as the plane takes off for Bangkok.

Subject: (SBU) John Yettaw Sentenced to 7 Years
Importance: High

SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED

All,

John Yettaw was sentenced today to 7 years in prison (3 years for his immigration violation; 3 years for violating Burma's
State Protection Law; and 1 year for violating a municipal swimming ordinance).

I was granted a 40-minute prison visit with Yettaw two hours after the verdict was read. He was in surprisingly good
spirits and looked healthier than he had in a couple weeks.
                                                     He said he plans to appeal the verdict.

Vice Consul Hayward Alto spoke with                         with news of the sentence.

Please see high side cable on Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's sentence and low side cable (attached) for more details on
Yettaw's sentence and health.

Regards,

Colin Furst
Consul
