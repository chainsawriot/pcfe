Subject: "Security Incident" in Saudi Arabia, Unconfirmed reports of Hostages and casualties

At 0429 EDT Mr. Kim Davidson, RSO Embassy Riyadh, informed the EAO that there has been a "security incident" in the
city of Yanbu, Saudi Arabia (approx 150 km North of Jeddah). Saudi Arabia security forces have engaged "some type of
bad guys". Post cannot confirm if the bad guys are terrorist or just some criminal element, but notes that the MFA is
saying the incident is purely criminal. Post further notes that there is a desalinization plant and oil refinery located in
Yanbu which have been targets of previous terrorist attacks. Post commented there will be several visiting dignitaries
and heads of state in Saudi Arabia tomorrow for the opening of a major University. A local Human rights group is
reporting to media that there are several injuries, casualties, and hostages as a result of the security incident. The
Emergency Action Committee will convene at 1230 Riyadh time to discuss post reaction.
