Subject:                        Higher Education Dinner on August 17 - Proposed Guest List




HRC:

Below is the recommended guest list for the August 17 Education Dinner. I solicited input from Nina F, AMS,
and John. I think it's a good list but you should look through it â€” it's long (19) b/c there likely will be a large
number who will not be available in August given the academic calendar. We will work our way down it to get
12-14 outside attendees leaving about 6 seats for State.

The guest list includes university and college presidents, scholars, public intellectuals and journalists who have
thought creatively about the role higher education is playing and could play as part of "smart diplomacy".

Once you sign off on this guest list for invitations (so add or subject any), I will work with Anne-Marie to
discuss format and assignments for folks for speaking.
