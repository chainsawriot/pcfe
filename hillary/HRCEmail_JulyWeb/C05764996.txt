Just leaving Oslo. Jonas Store sure appreciates his good working rel with you, and seems super eager to help on Afpak.
Rumor is that, with elecitons behind them, he may be moved to (get this!) the health ministry. He's mum on subject,
but it makes political sense in Norway. Rumored rpt rumored successor is Jan Egeland-who would be a very good
choice, though Jonas is in a class by himself. Off to Istanbul. Cheers.
