Madame Secretary:


Thank you for reaching out to Secretary Solis and convincing her to join the Verification Commission. She and Ricardo
Lagos will make for a very high profile and effective international component of the Commission.

We will meet with her this morning at 10 am to brief her for Tuesday's journey to Honduras. At this point, it appears we
have a military aircraft available. The plan is for the U.S. Delegation to depart D.C., stop in Miami to pick up Ricardo
Lagos, and arrive in Tegucigalpa together. We think this will send a powerful message to Hondurans and leave no doubt
about our commitment to seeing this process through to a successful conclusion.




You should be aware that Ambassador Hugo Llorens is under public assault. The Wall Street Journal dedicates its
America's column this morning to attacking him and calling for his removal. Last Friday, Representative Connie Mack did
the same. This chorus will grow as the extent of our accomplishment is understood. Llorens is a tough, stalwart guy. He
and his Mission have held firm during this crisis. A call from you would be a big boost.

Finally, we will hold an IPC today to identify further steps. We will keep you up to date on these steps and identify
further opportunities for your engagement.




I want to thank you for your leadership and support during this long crisis. Your willingness to engage at key moments
and take risks at the right time have propelled us much further than anyone expected. Your diplomacy prevented a
debilitating civil conflict in Honduras that would have destabilized Central America and undermined two decades of our
efforts. We now have a big opportunity in front of us, and for that we are grateful to you.

Regards,
Tom

Tom and Craig--


 I spoke w Secretary Solis and thanked her for going to Honduras. She is eager for your briefing and advice when you
meet w her today. And it is very important that Craig is going w her to guide her thru this process.

  Oscar Arias told me he is very worried about whether the agreement will be implemented and is meeting w the
leading Presidential candidate this week to urge that he produce his party's 55 votes for restitution.

 I also spoke w Insulza who is focussed on the elections which I told him we would fully support. Is there more we
should be doing?

 Again, thanks for all your great work and good luck in the effort to get this across the finish line. Best, HRC
