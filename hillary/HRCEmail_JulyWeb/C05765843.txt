Subject: cairo +15 speech in early january

About six weeks ago, HRC agreed to give a speech commemorating the anniversary of the 1994 UN Conference on
Population and Development in Cairo. I believe the actual anniversary is December 18th so frankly, if we did the speech
in early January, we would not be that far off the mark. The idea would be to do this speech at State with the audience
including the NGOs, Gates Foundation, UN, and Packard Foundations. This speech could send a message regarding the
link between population and environmental sustainability and as a result, improve women's status and rights. I would
love to give them January 6th_8th if that works on your end.

Special Assistant to the Secretary of State
