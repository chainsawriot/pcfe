S can announce the breakthrough. She should say something like:

-- I welcome news of a breakthrough in negotiations in Honduras.

-- I congratulate the Honduran people, President Zelaya, and Mr. Micheletti for this historic agreement.

-- I also congratulate Costan Rican President Oscar Arias for the important role he played in fashioning the San Jose
process, and the OAS for its role in facilitating this successful round of talks.

-- I cannot think of another example of a country that, having suffered a rupture of its democratic and constitutional
order, overcome such a crisis through negotiation and dialogue. This is an a big step forward for the inter-American
system and its commitment to democracy as embodied in the Inter-american Democratic Charter.
-- we were proud to be part of this process, and commit ourselves to working with Honduras as it prepares for elections.
