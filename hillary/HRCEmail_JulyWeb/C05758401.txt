Cheryl,
You are too kind. I am so excited to be playing on HRC's all star team, especially with you. Everyone I approach wants in
on what is a chance of a professional lifetime.




Have a safe trip in the warmer weather, Spring will come, I promise! Please give my best to the Secretary.
Hopefully I can be there permanently by early May!
Ellen

Cheryl,
Hope you are well and had a nice Easter. Had a terrific trip to Middle East...boy, is the Secretary a hit there!
Good neWs....Heather Samuelson has informed me that I have received
                         Everything has been submitted and I am hoping that I can be thru the process by May 7 in
order to go to the NPT review conference in NY. Hopefully                 will be confirmed by then, too.
Sharon Hardy has arranged for me to come to State on Wednesday at 10 am to get my security badge and DS briefing. I
will have a temporary office in the Transition area until I am confirmed.
Do you have some time Wednesday morning...or can we have lunch? I'd like to hear how the                       situation is
flushing out and go over some ideas/issues with you. I'm leaving town Thursday for a long weekend on what expect will
be my last Congressional break.
All the best,
Ellen
