Importance: High

Team — we really need something to go out today regarding Qadahfi's visit to the UNGA. There is a rally in NJ
planned for Sunday morning — that rally is growing in scope and impact as the time passes. The Congressional
interest and concern is also growing stronger. I would propose a statement from PJ, along the lines of the one
below, but am open to other ideas. Issuing something next week will not help us all that much.
