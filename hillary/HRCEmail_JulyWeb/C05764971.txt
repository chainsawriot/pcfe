Hugo:

I just wanted to confirm to you that up here we have reached out to Canada, Mexico, Panama, Colombia and Peru,
urging them to weigh in with Micheletti. The idea of course is to have M hear from governments that have high
credibility with the de factor. We will follow up to see if contacts are made.

All the best,
