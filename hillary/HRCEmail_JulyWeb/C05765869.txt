Media reports Israeli President Peres collapsed at an event in Tel Aviv this evening.




President S'iliiTâ– 011 Peres collapsed on Saturday night during a question-and-answer session for young executives at the

after a fedV seconds, at which point he was taken to a side room where Magen David Adorn medics treated him.

The president's personal physician later rushed to the scene.

After the incident, people close to Peres told Haaretz that he was feeling "good," that he left the hall walking, and that
he hat a protracted debate with his aides about whether to go to hospital, which the president refused to do.

Peres was ultimately taken to the Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer for further treatment.
