        The Honorable Hillary Rodham Clinton
         Secretary

         Washington, District of Columbia 20520



        Dear Secretary Clinton:

        I write to request your help with bi-lateral negotiations with Canada on a significant environmental issue
        in Montana. During your confirmation process we spoke about the need to engage with Canada to find
        permanent way to protect the natural resources in the North Fork of the Flathead River whiCh drains into
        northwestern Montana

        I appreciate your mentioning the need to address this issue to Canadian Foreign Minister Cannon at the
        June 2009 commemoration of the International Boundary Waters Treaty. I know that your team met on
        September I 1th with the Canadian government but that the scope of the meeting was focused solely on
        the environmental review process for mining proposals in British Columbia and Canada and that no next
        steps were identified.

        Following Interior Secretary Salazar's visit to Montana in August—a trip 1 hope you will make soon—
        we are working together on a plan to engage Canada in negotiations on this topic over the next five
        months. 1 hope this can be a joint effort with Interior and the State Department, but I need your
        leadership to make this a priority, assign one of your senior staff to take on this task, and work together
        to get bi-lateral talks started this year.



                                                                  Sincerely,
