Subject:                           CGI Speech First Draft
Attachments:                       CGI Draft 1 LM MR 9.20.09 930 pm.doc; ATT00001.txt



This is a very rough first cut at the CGI speech, mostly to give you an idea of structure, themes, and some of the
substance. It has a long way to go. We are still waiting for feedback and for input from various people, including Jack.

We will have a much improved draft by Monday night.

I'm not sure if you are in Washington or NY, but will fax this to Whitehaven in case you are there. Thanks.
