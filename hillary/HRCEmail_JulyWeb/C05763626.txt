Per my email on the other system, this is the press statement that Senator McCain delivered in Tripoli today, Aug
14. Senator Lieberman's statement was a bit stronger. PAO Josh Baker will forward a summary of that statement, along
with some suggested if-asked press guidance, to NEA/MAG and NEA/PPD.

Subject: statement

We have had a brief but productive time here in Libya. Our visit here, inconceivable just a few
years ago, is another indication of the remarkable transformation of relations between our two
countries.
During our visit, we met with the National Security Advisor, with Col. Qadafi, and with a
number of advisors to the leader. We expressed our appreciation for Libya's decision to give up
its weapons of mass destruction programs and become a partner in the fight against violent
Islamic extremism, and discussed the ways in which relations between our countries can
continue on a positive and productive path. In particular, we discussed the possibility of
moving ahead with the provision of non-lethal defense equipment to the government of Libya.
As we move ahead with the many ways in which the United States and Libya can work closely
as partners, there remain areas where there remains real work to be done. The status of human
rights and political reform in Libya will remain a chief element of concern. In addition, we
understand that no final decision has been reached regarding the potential release from Scottish
prison of Abdel Basset al Megrahi, the man convicted of involvement in the bombing of Pan
Am Flight 103. Nevertheless, we made clear in our meetings with Libyan officials that we are
resolutely opposed to his release.
We encouraged our Libyan interlocutors to handle this case — which, after all, involves an
individual convicted of killing American citizens — in a fashion that will strengthen the growing
ties of friendship between our two countries, rather than hinder its progress.
We discussed these and other issues in a spirit of mutual respect and friendship. The ties
between the United States and Libya have taken a remarkable and positive turn in recent years,

and we intend to help ensure that the relations between our countries deepen in all facets of the
relationship.
