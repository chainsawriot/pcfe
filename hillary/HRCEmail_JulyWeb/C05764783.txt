HRC,


-- The objective is to try shift the fulcrum of our current relations with Bibi
from settlements -- where he thinks he has the upper hand -- to ground where
there is greater understanding in Israel of the American position and where we
can make him uneasy about incurring our displeasure..

-- .Ironically, his intransigence over 67 borders may offer us that possibility
-- to turn his position against him.

-- What the President would say in NY (whether or not there is a trilateral):

- Despite Senator Mitchell's efforts, the conditions don't exist at this point
to maximize the chances of successful negotiations.

- Sending Mitchell back to to try to get the parties to agree on a common basis
to relaunch negotiations. This includes:

o a safe, secure and recognized Israel living side by side in peace with a safe,
secure and sovereign Palestine
o and an end to the occupation that began in 1967.

-- This 67 formulation was used in the Road Map, by Bush, Sharon and Olmert.

Assuming Bibi will accept no formulation that includes 67 borders, it suggests
that Bibi is the obstacle to progress and backtracking on his part on an issue
that previous Israeli governments have accepted.

-- It begins shifting the discussion from settlements to the more fundamental
issue of ultimate territorial outcome.

Call me if you want to discuss further.
