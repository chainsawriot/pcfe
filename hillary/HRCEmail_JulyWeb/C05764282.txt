Hi Cheryl,
Thanks for your email. I am on a plane now — headed back from Istambul. I have not has any time to address this. But I
will certainly work on it shortly. And in fact am meeting with David this week to do so.

But I also think it is essential to take into account the concerns of the Hill. In Jose's hearings and mine, the committee
quite explicitly and directly said they expected us to play significant roles in energy. David should certainly have the lead
role, as the secretary has said and as the legislation clearly spells out, but we also need to figure out how we can work
together. And I am sure that can be done amicably under david's overall leadership in this area. But H should be
consulted and talk to the SFRC before any changes are made to avoid any surprises and be sure they understand what is
being done. And, of course, I want to be sure we bring in Jose on any discussions, since he has important interests in this.

Regards,
Bob

Bob:

I hope you are settling in — looking forward to finding a moment to connect with you. I particularly want to make sure
we follow-up on energy in your title and making sure lines are clear in that arena to avoid any dropped balls or missed
opportunities.

I wanted to flag one matter now because the Secretary has asked David Goldwyn during her look-ahead meeting
regarding energy, to move forward on several energy security priorities — including engaging with key producers like
Brazil, Mexico, Angola and Nigeria as well as addressing energy security concerns with consumers like China and India.

Given that E/EEB previously had the lead on energy matters before we had an International Energy Coordinator, I want
to make sure you and he are properly and smoothly transitioning matters to him.

One example I know is pending that I discussed yesterday with the Secretary is Brazil. I know David will need to leverage
our engagement on biofuels with Brazil, to take up issues that may be more challenging, like Brazil's hydrocarbons
framework. Are you all making appropriate transitions on this?

Before I reach out to David, can you advise where things stand in this regard?

Thanks.
