Madam Secretary,

Our chief negotiator for the Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA) just reported that a provisional agreement has been
reached with the Colombians. It will have to go through translation and other scrubbing over the next couple of weeks
before its ready to be signed but this should be good news for your proposed meeting with Foreign Minister Bermudez
next week. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Andrew
