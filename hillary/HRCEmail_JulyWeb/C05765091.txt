Re: Update on Blair/EU presidency

Jonathan Powell just called to relay the following: He says the Blair EU candidacy is far from dead, though a
40-60 proposition now. Powell has spoken with Sarkozy, who remains supportive. The Socialists damaged Blair
because they don't want a strong president and floated the Miliband as EU foreign secretary story in order to
undermine Tony further. Powell (and Tony) appreciates Bill's willingness to write an op-ed, but understands
why it couldn't be published. Merkel remains the key. Having been for Tony, she is now neutral, but still
favorably inclined and doesn't know what to do. A nonentity as president would not appeal to her. Your
conversation with her remains important.
