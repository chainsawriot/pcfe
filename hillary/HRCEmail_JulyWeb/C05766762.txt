Dear Hillary,
I'm thinking of you today and sending you my love and warmest good wishes for your birthday. I hope you have a fun
celebration planned and that you are able to relax a little, and enjoy your birthday before you set off on your trip.
I am looking forward with great excitement to seeing you here soon and to welcoming you to Pakistan. I am just waiting
now to hear where and when as soon as your program is fixed.
Warmly,
Spenta
