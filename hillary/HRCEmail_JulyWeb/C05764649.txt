I would love to see you. We'll have to play timing by ear so I'm copying Huma and Lona to help schedule.

Hillary,
I expect you are claimed six times over, given everyone who is in NY for CGI, but I will be in NY from tonight through next
Saturday (returning Saturday), so if you could have dinner Friday night or just a cup of tea after the closing plenary, I
would love to see you.

I loved the Washington Post piece1111 I And your inquiry meant a lot to        and I appreciated having a few minutes to
talk. I know how true it is that this is "24/7" as the Post quoted you remarking.

Hillary: See today's "Limits of Force" OpEd by Chuck Hagel. No answers but apt analysis.

Might Congressional momentum for development assistance reform warrant serious consideration of former or current
Member of Congress to head USAID? Hagel? Lee Hamilton?... Still thinking!
