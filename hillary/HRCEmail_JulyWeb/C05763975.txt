Ms. Cheryl Mills
Counselor & Chief of Staff
Department of State

Dear Chief of Staff,
Following our short exchange of views, on the margins of your last meeting with the African
Diplomatic Group on Food Security, and yesterday's press release on Secretary of State's visit to
Africa, I wish to express my deepest appreciation for your personal support in the positive
consideration of the invitation the Cape Verdian Minister of Foreign Affairs extended to Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton.
The Cape Verdian authorities see this visit as an important landmark in the bilateral relations between
Cape Verde and the US and an opportunity to discuss ways to strenghten those relations and our
cooperation at the international level where we share various views and goals. We therefore look
forward to the visit with much enthusiasm.
In this line, I wish to reiterate that the Embassy of Cape Verde and myself stand ready to facilitate
and contribute in any way deemed necessary to ensure an adequate preparation of the visit.
Please feel free to contact me at my following e-mails:
official e-mail

or
My private one

or by cell phone


It will be for me a personal pleasure to welcome you in my country.
Best regards,
Fatima Veiga
