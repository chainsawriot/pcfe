This relates to a conversation I had with S. So far we seem to be ok regarding the Brazilian mission in Tegucigalpa.

Subject: Regime Plan to Break-in to Brazilian Embassy

Tom/Dan/Craig: Regime DFM Marta Lorena Alvarado denied a few minutes on TV that the regime had any intention to
entering the Brazilian Embassy to arrest Z. She accused Z supporters of spreading the rumors to create a climate of
tension and uncertainly.

This tracks with all of the information that we have been picking up from the HOAF, Supreme Court and the Attorney
General's office. We've made clear in all of our conversations with regime contacts they would face "grave
consequences" if they violate the diplomatic sanctity of the Brazilian Embassy.

I hate to agree with the regime, but on this one they may be right. The calls from regime contacts appear synchronized
and are coming out of Managua, Guatemala, here in Tegucigalpa, as well as NYC. However, to be sure, we've made a
second round of calls. Both the Minister of Security and the Attorney General have again told us that the regime has
no/no intention of entering the Brazilian Embassy.
