I spoke with        this morning. She is interested in working with Stephen Rapp in the Office of War Crimes. The office     B6
is very small wit a limited number of slots.

                                                                                             She has been in contact
 with Stephen directly about the possibility of working for him, and he seems favorable about bringing her on board

  h I - I sent you the staffing plan for the office earlier today to see if there is a way to make this work. Otherwise,
       has expressed interest in DRL, EEB and applying for a career position in L.

Heather and I spoke verbally about this'a short while ago, but just to put it in writing...

             has a call into the Secretary about his daughter,       nd the status of her pending employment at the
 State Department.           has been in touch with Heather, but Senator =called today to raise this to the Secretary's
 level. When I spoke with him, he was getting on a plane, so she doesn't need to call him back imminently, but I will tell
 her about his call before she leaves tonight.
 Heather, could you please provide Huma with a couple of bullets for HRC about           status?

Thanks

Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton
