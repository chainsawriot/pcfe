.... for terrific talk and discussion. Your robust statement on missile
defense was the best so far. As for your robust push-back on the premise
of my healthcare question, I didn't mean to imply that the Clinton
administration's foreign policy agenda suffered back then—rather, that
there's jeopardy to the Obama administration's foreign policy if the
current debate/fight turns out badly. But you mooted the whole thing by
reassuring us that all will turn out okay.
   Anyway, I've taken an aspirin — and thank you profoundly for a great
event, and, of course, for the gracious personal touches.
