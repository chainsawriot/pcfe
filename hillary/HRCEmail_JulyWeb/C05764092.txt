Low turnout seen in Afghan election; 26 killed
 KABUL (AP) Millions of Afghans defied threats Thursday to cast ballots in the country's second national elections since
Taliban rule, but turnout appeared weaker this time because of continuing violence, fear and disenchantment. In much
of the Taliban's southern strongholds, many people did not dare to vote, bolstering the hopes of President Hamid
Karzai's chief rival. At least 26 people were killed in election-related violence, fewer than had been feared. Officials
began counting millions of ballots as soon as the polls closed at 5 p.m. after a one-hour extension. First preliminary
results weren't expected for several days, and some major candidates were already alleging fraud. A top election
official, Zekria Barakzai, told The Associated Press that he estimated 40 to 50 percent of the country's 15 million
registered voters cast ballots far lower than the 70 percent who voted in the presidential election in 2004.
