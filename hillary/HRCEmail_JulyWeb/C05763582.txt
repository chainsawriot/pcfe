EDINBURGH (AP) - Sky News and BBC television reported Wednesday that Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset
Ali al-Megrahi was to be freed from his Scottish prison on humanitarian grounds, but the minister in charge of
deciding al-Megrahi's fate denied that any such decision had been made. Neither news network cited a source
for its report. Scottish Justice Minister Kenny MacAskill, who was due to decide whether to release al-Megrahi,
told a local television station he had yet to make up his mind. A call and an e-mail sent to al-Megrahi's Scottish
lawyer were not immediately returned late Wednesday. "The decision will be made next week," MacAskill
told Scottish Television late Wednesday. Two spokeswomen for the Scotland's devolved government dismissed
the BBC and Sky reports as speculation. "Absolutely no decision has been taken on that," a spokeswoman for
the Scottish Executive said. "Categorically no decision has been made at this stage."
