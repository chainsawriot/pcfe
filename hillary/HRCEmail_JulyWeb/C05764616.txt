Nalbandian statement: "The Turkish side is informed and we are confident that they realize that we exclude the
conditioning of the normalization of Turkish-Armenian relations on steps toward the settlement of the Karabakh
conflict. Trying to link these two processes could lead to the failure of both. A number of countries, including
those of the Minsk Group Co-Chairs, have the same position. They have said many times that the normalization
of relations between Turkey and Armenia must be without preconditions. With this mutual understanding, we
have started and conducted negotiations and come to agreements that are reflected in the initialed protocols. If
the Turkish leadership has problems with the signing of these documents, they should not try to solve them by
distorting the spirit, essence, and goals of the initialed documents. The signing and implementation of the
agreed documents is a process that is full of difficulties. Nevertheless, Armenia is ready to respect the
agreements and move forward If the current authorities in Turkey are not ready to accept the fact of the
genocide perpetrated in the Ottoman Empire, then they are at least obliged to show respect toward the
survivors of the Armenian genocide and their descendants."

Huma can you make sure S sees this before calls.

meetings of Aliyev-Medvedev-Sargsian. We are much closer to a Karabakh solution. Without that issue being
resolved, it is impossible for our side to take this step. Armenia must free itself of being led by the
diaspora. Armenia doesn't get any benefit from the diaspora. The diaspora scores points by using
Armenia. That's what it does. The diaspora in the U.S. and France does this."
