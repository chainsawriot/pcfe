Huma, Jake, Joe,

Here is the vote on the Iran human rights resolution at UNGA. I briefed the S during the retreat coffee break. She asked
for the text of the resolution. The link is below. Do you want a hard copy here at the retreat?

2009 FINAL VOTE (3C): 74 YES (US) — 48 NO (Iran) — 59 (ABSTAIN)

Wider margin than last year:

2008 FINAL VOTE (3C): 70 YES (U.S.) — 51 NO (Iran) -60 (ABSTAIN).

Thanks! I just told the S, Sen Mitchell and A/S Posner. Will seek out A/S Feltman.

The S has asked for the text of the resolution. I'll check on how to get document here.
