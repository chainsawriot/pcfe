                 SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON
                    REMARKS AT THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTION
                               WASHINGTON, DC
                              SEPTEMBER 18, 2009




  I appreciate the opportunity to join you on the eve of the United Nations
  General Assembly and to outline some key issues that the Obama
  Administration will focus on in New York and in the weeks and months
  ahead.



  Let me begin, though, by echoing the President's statement yesterday
  that he has approved the recommendations of the Pentagon and his entire
  national security team to deploy a stronger and more comprehensive
  missile defense system in Europe. This decision came after a lengthy
  and in-depth review of our assessment of the threat posed by Iran's
  ballistic missile program, and the technology that we have to confront it.
  And it is a decision that will leave America stronger, and more capable
  of defending our troops, our interests, and our Allies.




                                               1

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015




Let's be clear about what this new system will do relative to the previous
program — which was many years from being deployed. With the
President's decision, we will deploy missile defense sooner than the
previous program, so that we will be able to swiftly counter the threat
posed by Iran's short and medium-range ballistic missiles.


We will deploy missile defense that is more comprehensive than the
previous program, with more interceptors in more places, and a better
capacity to protect all of our friends and allies in the region. We will
deploy technology that is actually proven so that we do not waste time or
taxpayer money, and we will preserve the flexibility to adjust our
approach to the threat as it evolves.


 So make no mistake: if you support missile defense, then this is a
stronger and smarter approach than the previous program. It does what
missile defense is actually supposed to do — it defends America and our
Allies.




                                              2

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015




Now I know we have heard criticism of this plan from some quarters.
But much of it is not connected to facts. We are not "shelving" missile
defense, we are deploying missile defense sooner than the Bush
Administration planned to, and we are deploying a more comprehensive
system. We are not reducing our capacity to protect our interests and our
Allies from Iran, we are increasing that capacity and focusing it on our
understanding of Iran's capabilities. And most of all, we would never
walk away from our Allies — instead, we are deploying a system that
 enhances their security, that advances our cooperation with NATO, and
 that actually places more resources in more countries.


 Two of those Allies are Poland and the Czech Republic, and we deeply
 appreciate their willingness to host parts of the previously planned
 system. We will continue to cooperate closely with both nations — for
 instance, through rotation of a Patriot battery in Poland, and close
 missile defense research and development work with Czech companies.
 As we explore land based interceptors going forward, we have made it
 clear that those two,countries will be at the top of the list. And let me
 underscore that we are bound together by our common commitment as
 NATO Allies, and also by deep historical, economic, and cultural ties
 that will never be broken.




                                              3

Finally, let me reiterate what the President said yesterday: this decision
was not about Russia; it was about Iran and the threat that its ballistic
missile programs continue to pose. And because of this decision, we will
be in a far stronger position to deal with that threat, and to do so with
technology that works.


My main reason for being here today is to give you a review of our
agenda next week in New York. Before I get to specifics, though, I want
to share a quick story. A few days ago, a friend, knowing I was heading
 to the UN General Assembly, gave me a cartoon from The New Yorker.
It showed a delegate in his seat at the United Nations passing a note to
 the delegate next to him. And the caption read: "Shhh. It's a birthday
 card for Lichtenstein. Sign it and pass it on."




                                              4

 Well, comic relief is essential in our line of work. But as with most
 humor, this cartoon is also commentary. And it represents one view of
 the United Nations — a caricature of what multilateral organizations
 spend their time doing.



 As President Obama leads our US delegation at this year's General
 Assembly, I hope we can demonstrate that the United Nations does not
 have to be just a diplomatic talk shop on Pt Avenue.



 At its best, it can be an institution that brings the world's nations
 together to solve global problems through adherence to rules and
 principles set forth in the UN Charter. And it is the responsibility of the
 192 member nations — during the General Assembly and beyond -- to
 capitalize on the opportunity for global cooperation and progress that the
 UN affords.

 I outlined earlier this summer at the Council on Foreign Relations the
 Obama Administration's efforts to advance our interests and solve
 today's problems through a global architecture of cooperation.



 We must begin by taking responsibility ourselves — something that under
 President Obama we have already begun to do on issues from climate
 change to non-proliferation. And we have called on others to do the
 same.



By building and strengthening partnerships, institutions, and
 international regimes, we can forge a global consensus and use that
leverage to offer clear incentives to all nations to cooperate and live up
to their responsibilities, and strong disincentives to act in isolation or
provoke conflict. The United Nations and this month's General
Assembly offer a venue and a forum for nations to work together to live
up to the founding charter and abide by and enforce international rules in
service of global peace and security.

 This is not only critical to the effectiveness of global institutions; it is
 essential to meeting the global challenges of the 21' century. This is
 what Strobe describes as "The Great Experiment" — and I believe it is
 the heart of America's mission in the world today.



Few issues reflect the need for a global architecture of cooperation more
than nuclear non-proliferation. No issue poses a more serious threat to
our security or the world's, and it will be a main topic of discussion next
week and beyond.



The President outlined a robust and ambitious arms control and
nonproliferation agenda in Prague earlier this year that can move us
toward a world without nuclear weapons.



As the President said, this won't be easy. It might not even happen in
our lifetimes. And, as long as nuclear weapons exist in the world, the
United States will maintain a safe, secure and effective deterrent
capability.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015




Next week, the President will chair a meeting of the U.N. Security
 Council on nonproliferation and disarmament. He will emphasize the
 importance of strengthening the international nuclear nonproliferation
 regime — and the critical role the Council must play in enforcing
 compliance with nonproliferation obligations.



 The President also has asked me to lead the U.S. delegation to a
 conference on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and this will be the
 first time a Secretary of State has attended. It will give me the
 opportunity to underscore the importance of the CTBT to the global
 nonproliferation effort and to broader U.S. security interests.



 Strengthening the non-proliferation regime means working to bring
 other nations into compliance. This includes North Korea and Iran. Let
 me take a moment to speak about Iran, another key topic on my agenda
 next week.

To begin, it is important to recall what's really at issue, and what's really
at stake.


Iran has refused for years to address the international community's deep
 concerns about its nuclear program, underscored repeatedly by the
International Atomic Energy Agency and the UN Security Council.



 Iran's continued failure to live up to its obligations carries profound
 consequences — for the security of the United States and our allies; for
progress on global non-proliferation and progress towards disarmament;
 for the credibility of the Security Council and the Non-Proliferation
 Treaty; and for stability in the Middle East and beyond.




 Our concern is not Iran's right to develop peaceful nuclear energy, but
 its responsibility to demonstrate that its program is intended exclusively
 for peaceful purposes. This is not hard to do. Iran's continued refusal to
 cooperate has damaged the credibility of its claim that it does not seek a
 nuclear weapon.




                                              9

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015




Iran faces a choice. The international community has made abundantly
 clear what is possible for all Iranians if Iran lives up to its
responsibilities on the nuclear issue — the benefits of economic
connections to the rest of the world, cooperation on peaceful nuclear
energy, and partnership in education and science.




But there will be accompanying costs for Iran's continued defiance -
more isolation and economic pressure, and less possibility of progress
for the people of Iran.


The Obama Administration has clearly conveyed our readiness to
engage directly with Iran. We know that dialogue doesn't guarantee
success. But we also know that our past refusal to engage yielded no
progress on the nuclear issue, nor did it stem Iran's support for terrorist
groups.


Over the past eight months, the President has reached out both to the
Iranian government and people. We have made clear our desire to
resolve issues with Iran diplomatically. Iran must now decide whether
to join us in this effort.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015




 Yet, since June, we have seen the Iranian government engaged in a
 mockery of the justice system, including show trials, and suppression of
 free speech. The Iranian government seeks a sense of justice in the
 world, but stands in the way of the justice it seeks.



 Nonetheless, we remain ready to engage with Iran — not as an end in
 itself, but as a means of addressing the growing concerns that we and
 our international partners have about Iran's actions, especially on the
 nuclear issue. In New York next week, I will meet with my counterparts
 from the United Kingdom, France, Russia, China and Germany to
 discuss the way forward and prepare for talks that the European Union's
 Javier Solana is arranging at the beginning of October.


 Our message will be clear: We are serious. We will soon see if the
 Iranians are serious. This is not about process for the sake of process. In
 New York, we will work with our partners to put Iran's choice into
 focus and to stress that engagement must produce real results and that
 we have no appetite for talk without action.

 Let me also highlight a few other issues that I will be addressing at the
 General Assembly and in the months ahead: Iraq, Afghanistan and
 Pakistan; development; and women.


 Iraq has made important strides with the support of the United States and
 the international community to build a more secure and hopeful future
 for its people. We look forward to the parliamentary election next
 January as an important milestone in this journey, and pledge to work
 with Iraqis and the international community, including the invaluable
 UN Mission to Iraq, to make these elections a success.



 As a result of our common efforts, our relationship with Iraq can now
 enter into a period of transition as our military draws down and the role
 of civilian agencies increases to better meet the needs of the future and
 ensure a stable, sovereign and independent Iraq that contributes to peace
 and security in the Middle East. This reflects no lessening of our
 commitment — on the contrary, it demonstrates that we have entered a
 new, sustained and more mature partnership that will serve both of
 countries far into the future. I'm pleased that Vice President Biden,
 accompanied by my Deputy Jim Steinberg, recently returned to Iraq to
 continue our robust engagement with Iraq's leaders.



                                              12

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015




 The partnership between our countries will continue to build security
 cooperation while strengthening diplomatic relations and building
 stronger ties in commerce, rule of law, education, science and culture
 through our Strategic Framework Agreement coordinating committee, a
 session of which Prime Minister Maliki and I co-chaired in July. [We'll
 seek to hold another session in the coming months].



 Also on my docket for the General Assembly will be meetings related to
 Afghanistan and Pakistan. President Obama has stated our core goal: to
 disrupt, dismantle, and ultimately defeat al-Qaida and its extremist
 allies, and to prevent their return to either country. This is a goal we
 share with Afghanistan, with Pakistan and with the international
 community. In fact, pursuing al-Qaida and the Taliban was the basis of
 the original UN resolutions that authorized U.S. military action after the
 September 1 1 th attacks and created ISAF, the International Security
 Assistance Force of 42 nations helping Afghans secure their country.




                                             13

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015




 Our long-term security, and that of our friends around the world, is
 connected to the security and well-being of the people of Afghanistan
 and Pakistan. To effectively squeeze the extremists fighting to
 destabilize both countries, the Afghan and Pakistani governments must
 be better able to secure their territory from extremists and meet the basic
 needs of their populations.



 The recent Afghan elections at once illustrate the promise and the
 challenges of Afghanistan. Alongside our partners and the UN, we will
 continue to encourage all parties to respect the international and Afghan
 electoral institutions charged with determining the final outcome of the
 election process. When the next president is inaugurated, we will work
 to step up the level of international engagement with the new
 government in a strong partnership to strengthen governance at all
 levels.



 As we address these urgent challenges, we will also work on other issues
 that have implications for American security and interests. Following up
 on my trip to Africa last month, and the President's visit to Ghana earlier
 in the year, he will host a lunch for leaders of sub-Saharan Africa during
 the General Assembly. I will meet with Costa Rican President Oscar
 Arias to continue our joint efforts to resolve the crisis in Honduras and

                                              14

 help that country restore the democratic constitutional order. I will also
 be meeting with donors and other stakeholders committed to helping
Haiti respond to the economic dislocation caused by the global
 economic crisis and the hurricane. And I will continue discussions with
 our allies and other partners in Asia about the situation in Burma.



If the global architecture of cooperation demands responsibility of us
and our partners, it also offers opportunities. Just as we are focusing
 intensively on urgent challenges like Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan and
 Pakistan, so too are we pursuing a positive agenda devoted to expanding
 opportunity so that more people in more places can fulfill their dreams
and live up to their God-given potential. And I will focus considerable
 attention on two areas of opportunity — development and women.



Many of you have heard me describe our plans to integrate diplomacy
 and development as two of the three pillars of our foreign policy, along
 with defense.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015




 I have talked in different venues about the Obama Administration's
 commitment to leading with diplomacy and engaging other nations --
with and beyond government. Next week, I will outline how we will
approach development in tandem with our diplomacy — to be effective
and efficient and enable the State Department, USAID, and the
Millennium Challenge Corporation to pursue and execute 21st century
 foreign policy goals.




The foundation for our approach will be principles that will move us
away from top-down assistance that too often fails to meet the needs of
those we are attempting to help, or has only short-term effect. To solve
the complex problems of today's world — where issues like poverty,
hunger, health, and climate change intersect — we want to focus on root
causes, and on country-driven efforts that are comprehensive, last over
time, leverage existing multi-lateral institutions and foster new
partnerships, and coordinate donors and stakeholders strategically.

 I will have the chance to detail this approach during my stay in New
 York, and I also look forward to highlighting these issues when I
participate in an event that the UN Secretary General will host on food
security.


To successfully integrate our diplomacy and development goals at the
State Department and USAID, we have launched a Quadrennial
Diplomacy and Development Review — and, I regret to say that, in so
doing, we have added another acronym to the State lexicon: QDDR.




The QDDR, led by Deputy Secretary of State Jack Lew, is a broad
examination of our structure, policies, and budget, and will lead to better
accountability and measurable results throughout the department.


Finally, our delegation, and I personally, will work to advance
international efforts to recognize women as key drivers of economic
progress and social stability, as well as to address impediments to
women's empowerment and advancement, particularly sexual and
gender-based violence.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015




I will chair a session of the Security Council and will speak on behalf of
the adoption of a resolution on "women, peace and security" which will
endorse concrete measures to implement Security Council Resolution
1820 and address sexual and gender-based violence as a tactic of war.



I saw the scale of misery caused by this violence on my recent trip to the
Democratic Republic of Congo, where I met with rape survivors as well
as those trying to assist them.



Next week, I will be speaking with other foreign ministers and heads of
state about strategies to end this violence and to ensure that those who
commit atrocities are prosecuted and not treated with impunity.



I will also work with women leaders at the General Assembly to
highlight the importance of raising the status of girls and women and
investing in their potential — through education, economic development,
and health care. If women are free from violence, and accorded their
rights, they can contribute to their local economies and become change
agents generating greater prosperity and stability for their families,
communities, and societies as a whole.

 Every day, I go to work at the State Department and am reminded that
 the world has given us no shortage of urgent crises or long-range
 challenges. Our agenda is full and it is ambitious — from Northeast Asia
 to sub-Saharan Africa to Europe and the Americas. And we will remain
 vigilant and pro-active about all of the issues, even as our plate seems to
 get fuller by the day. And I will be relying on all of you to share your
 expertise and advice in helping us do our jobs as well as we can to serve
 our nation and the American people.




 At this time of year, as we contemplate the agenda at the UN next week,
 and what the world will hold in the months and years beyond, it seems
 appropriate to think of new beginnings. Not only because the nations of
 the world are about to meet — which is an opportunity -- but because we
 are also celebrating the end of Ramadan and the beginning of the Jewish
 High Holy Days.


 It is a time of reflection and renewal for hundreds of millions of our
 fellow citizens around the globe. A time when we can borrow from all of
 the world's great faiths to take stock, re-assess, and re-commit ourselves
 to the values and ideals that move us forward. And it is in that spirit that
 I am approaching the General Assembly and the months ahead.
