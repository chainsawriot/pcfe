HRC —

They are looking for your sign off on this as early this am — the final will have any edits recommended by Jim.

Take a look (my only thought is it sounds defensive which I know is our posture but many of these points could be stated
affirmatively — the content is fine).

Subject: Urgent Letter for the Secretary's Clearance

Cheryl,


As discussed, please see the attached draft cable for the Secretary's approval. The draft letter text is pasted
below. WHA would like the Secretary to send a letter to all the UNASUR (Union of South American Nations)
foreign ministers regarding support for the U.S.-Colombia Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA). UNASUR is
having its summit meeting on August 28 and WHA would like the letter sent as soon as possible so that it can
be read and processed before the summit. Please note that Steinberg himself has NOT signed off on this
letter (his staff has), but we are expecting to hear from him this morning. Please tell me if you think this
should be held till he weighs in.


BEGIN DRAFT TEXT:


Dear Mr./Madam Minister:
