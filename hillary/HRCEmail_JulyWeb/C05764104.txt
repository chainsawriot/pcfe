We are waiting for DRL to clear the language. I will call Mike and/or Karen now. Everyone else is comfortable.
Then we will get it to you and put it out in Melanne's voice. You'll have something very soon.

I like the idea of it being issued by someone else but I still want to see it. Let's close this out.
