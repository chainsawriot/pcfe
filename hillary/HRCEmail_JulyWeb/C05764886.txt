Cheryl, thanks for connecting us. More importantly, thanks to Secretary Clinton and to you for your confidence
in us as we move forward with the MCC. It's a very exciting time, and a very exciting challenge!

Daniel, I am very pleased to meet you virtually, and look forward to meeting you in person next week. Please
let me know a convenient time and we'll get together.

It is probably best to use my personal email so my current colleagues don't get too jumpy! So you can reach me
at:



Thanks!

Steve

Daniel and Steve:

First, congratulations to you both. The Secretary is very excited about your pending service as CEO and
Deputy at the MCC. She knows that you will do a great job in providing the vision, leadership and support
MCC deserves in navigating the complex world of elevating development in the context of our foreign policy.

 I wanted to introduce the two of you by email so you could reach out to each other and coordinate
connecting. I know Daniel will be in Washington starting next week for a period, and will be coordinating with
you all to schedule time to see you as convenient.

I know the Secretary also will want to make sure she has a chance to connect with you both as well.
