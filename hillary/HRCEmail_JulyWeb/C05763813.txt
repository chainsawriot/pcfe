Rich -- I thought the admonitions S gave to Ellen Tauscher about how we need a serious Hill strategy plan re Start and
CTBT and that such a plan must necessarily inform the actual negotiating work that Rose does could have been applied
word for word to climate. I am going to raise this with her on the India trip. I'll tell her we've met and that we're
meeting again soon. But I am also going to make clear that I may need to bring in a completely dedicated high-level
person to do this. I just have a very hard time figuring out how you guys, with all you're up against, can do this
yourselves.
