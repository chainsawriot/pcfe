Top Russian official: no missiles near Poland
MOSCOW (AP)-A Russian deputy defense minister has confirmed that the military has scrapped a plan to deploy missiles
near Poland. Vladimir Popovkin says that U.S. President Barack Obama's decision to dump the Bush-era plan to deploy
missile defense sites in Eastern Europe has made the deployment of Iskander short-range missiles in Russia's Kaliningrad
region unnecessary. Popovkin's statement on Ekho Moskvy radio Saturday confirmed previous similar statements by
other Russian officials.
