Dear All,

After this morning's meeting, L undertook more research




Millennium Challenge Report

The Millennium Challenge Act of 2003 requires the submission of a report to Congress and publication in the Federal
Register of a list of countries that are candidate countries for MCC assistance, and countries that would be candidate
countries but for "specified legal prohibitions on assistance." Honduras is a candidate country. If Honduras is subject to
the restrictions in section 7008, it would be listed in that section of the report that identifies countries that would be
candidate countries but for legal prohibitions that prohibit assistance. The report would also provide an explanation of
the legal prohibition (in fact, other coup restricted countries, such as Cote d'Ivoire, Madagascar, Mauritania, and Sudan,
are on the prohibited list and section 7008 is explicitly mentioned).

The list must be approved by the Board of the MCC, of which the Secretary is the chair, and is due on 9/10. It is our
understanding that an action memo will be presented to the Secretary, perhaps as early as next week, so that she can
approve submission of the report. The action memo will require the Secretary to decide whether Honduras is a country
without a "specified legal prohibition" or whether such a prohibition has in fact attached.

Section 7008 of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2009 (Div. H,
P.L. 111-8) provides:

 "None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available pursuant to titles Ill through VI of this Act shall be
 obligated or expended to finance directly any assistance to the government of any country whose duly elected head of
government is deposed by military coup or decree: Provided, That assistance may be resumed to such government if the
 President determined and certifies to the Committees on Appropriations that subsequent to the termination of
 assistance a democratically elected government has taken office: Provided further, That the provisions of this section
 shall not apply to assistance to promote democratic elections or public participation in democratic processes: Provided
further, That funds made available pursuant to the previous provisos shall be subject to the regular notification
 procedures of the Committees on Appropriations."
