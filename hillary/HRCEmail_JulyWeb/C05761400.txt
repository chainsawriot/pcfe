sister Secretary,




hope you are well and enjoying the blessings of The Lord!




i was hanging out with the girls this weekend at                           -- what a great time! -- and i got to chat with
cheryl a bit about what's happening with the religious freedom office. i was very glad to learn what was going on --

though not so glad to hear about the challenges you are now facing there. anyway, i wanted you to know that i have
been approached by                                                                          they are moving pretty
quickly but i expect to get a firm offer in the next few days and i will need to get back to them quickly.




                                              ill continue to try and stay connected to cheryl -- she has got to be
one of the hardest working woman in washington!




know that you are in my prayers every day, that you might have peace and joy, and that your spirit might be refreshed
and restored daily.




much love to you,
