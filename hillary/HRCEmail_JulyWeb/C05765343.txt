Assume you're in Berlin. Holbrooke just dazzled &, in some key cases, mollified, even persuaded Trilateral Commission re
Afpak. It was off-record. I strongly feel he & others shd be out there publicly establishing the theory of the case, not
least because that will help manage the delay before the Pres's decision/announcement.
  Safe travels & hi to Gorby (just kidding--he regards me as a Yeltsinite)
