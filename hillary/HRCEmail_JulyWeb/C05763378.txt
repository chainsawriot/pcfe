Observations

         1. There is a considerable change in Indonesian attitudes toward the United States. The latest Pew Global Polls
            indicate a 73% approval level; the last time it was nearly this level was only in the wake of the generous help
            provided after the Tsunami disaster. Higher education officials warmly welcomed our trip and, more importantly,
            are eager to increase student flows to America and institutional partnerships between U.S. and Indonesian
            universities. The Director General for Higher Education (DGHE) has been given a special budget to promote this,
            seven leading schools have been given special budgets by DGHE to explore partnerships, and the Ministry will
            support a delegation of leading Indonesian educators and Rectors to visit the U.S. sometime in late fall/early
            winter.
         2. The Delegation represented over 30 colleges and universities arrived only 9 days after the terrorist bombing of
            two hotels in Jakarta, which meant our Indonesian hosts deeply appreciated the show of solidarity we made by
            coming. During our visit, the White House announced that President Obama would come to Jakarta in
            November. The U.S. Ambassador arranged for the entire Country Team to brief us on our first day; we saw him
            and his senior staff three more times during the week for substantive meetings, and he attended the farewell
            dinner given by the Minister of Education. We were also scheduled to be received by President Susilo Bambang
            Yudhoyono (SBY), who had to cancel at the last minute due to the onset of flu. Earlier in the week we were
            hosted by his Spokesman.
         3. Nearly every Indonesian senior official with whom we met had been educated in the United States. But many of
            the officials just below that level had not had this chance. Some characterized this cohort as a lost generation
            and the senior officials all spoke about providing opportunities for this group now (through a "re-charging" program
            that the Government will fund) for short term study visits and about making sure that the next generation will now
            have the chances that the most senior group once did to come to America for especially graduate education.
         4. Indonesia, the 4th most populous country in the world, is the sixteenth-leading country of origin for students
            coming to the U.S.; number 15 is Hong Kong (8200 students). A little more than 7600 Indonesians are currently
            enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities. This is approximately half the number that were enrolled a decade
            ago. The decline began in the wake of the Asian Economic Crisis of 1997 and accelerated after 2001 when there
            were substantial visa issues and problems — coupled to a growing perception by Indonesians that America was an
            unfriendly and not very welcoming country, especially for Muslims. At the same time, major campaigns were
            launched by the governments of Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, China, Germany and the Netherlands to recruit
            Indonesian students; today there are over 20,000 Indonesians studying in Australia alone. The appeal of these
            countries also stems from the relative ease of applying to non-US higher education institutions and the willingness
            to take students with low levels of English.
                                                                 77

    5. We did not hear a single visa complaint during our meetings and public forum. The U.S. embassy is on track to
       issue a record number this year and now estimates that 80 percent of all student visa applications are being
       granted.
    6. The market for study abroad is probably very large. A recent poll by the Kompas newspaper found that 76.3% of
       Indonesian students would prefer to go abroad for at least one degree. There are over 4.5 million final-year high
       school students and 4.3 million currently enrolled in Indonesian universities, represent about a 17% enrollment
       rate about the college-age cohort. The Government wants to raise this to 25% by 2011. This means adding over
       400,000 new university students each year and doubling the size of the nation's entire teaching faculty. There are
       approximately 154,000 faculty, but only 7% have any form of advance degrees and fewer than 5,000 have a
       PhD. Capacity and quality challenges are huge.
    7. We were repeatedly told that Higher Education is a top national priority and that the Government would like a
       minimum international student enrollment of 5% in order to continue Indonesia's embrace of globalization nd
       better prepare their students for work in a globalized world. A Higher Education Reform effort is just getting
       underway, with initial emphasis on improving the quality and government support for science and
       technology. There are over 2800 institutions of higher education, but only 86 public universities and
       polytechnics. Enrollment in the public schools is about 1 million versus 3.4 million in private higher
       education. The Government is coming to terms with how best to regulate the private sector; a recently-passed
       law in Parliament calls for all private institutions to be brought under greater government control and oversight
       over the next 6 years. All boards of trustees will by then have to report on their activities to a government
       agency.
    8. A very small number of Americans, 132 in 2006-2007, study abroad for credit and most do so on short term,
       faculty-led study visits. The highest this number has ever been was only 215 (in 1994-1995). Most of the
       delegation did not immediately see how they could send their students here for semester or year-long programs,
       but an increasing number of courses are being taught in English at some leading universities. Almost all felt that
       only Gadjah Made University in Yogyakarta was well set up to receive U.S. students and able to offer a significant
       number of courses for them to take. Other institutions (especially in Bogor and possibly Bandung) offer promising
       sites for field research in agriculture, environmental studies ,and marine science. Bali will remain an important
       site for those in programs associated with the humanities and cultural studies.
    9. Education Ministry officials stressed their desire to move rapidly to build on the momentum of this visit, create new
       institutional partnerships, and expand educational programs under the official US-Indonesia Bilateral Partnership
       proposed by President SBY (who went to the US six times during the course of his education and is a graduate of
       Webster university) and endorsed by Secretary of State Clinton.
