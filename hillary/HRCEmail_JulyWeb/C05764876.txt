Subject: Truck bombs kill 16 people in Iraq (AP)

BAGHDAD (AP) At least 16 people have been killed as two truck bombs struck separate communities north of Iraq's
capital. One bombing killed at least a dozen people in a primarily Sunni village north of Baghdad. Officials say police
opened fire in an attempt to stop the truck, forcing it to change direction and slam into a concrete barrier near a market.
The blast damaged the police station and a number of nearby homes and shops. The attack comes three days after Iraqi
police defused a car bomb in the same area, and the police chief says it may be retaliation. The second attack occurred
near Mosul, where a parked truck bomb exploded and killed at least four people.
