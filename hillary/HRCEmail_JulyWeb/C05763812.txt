Subject: Good news from japan newt

Spending several days in meetings in Japan Secretary Clinton's visit here made a big impact

President Obama's invitation to Prime Minister Aso as the first white house guest also made a bg impact

I built up the imortance of the new ambassador

The election aigist 30 will be historic and the Japan Democratic Party will almost cetainly win

It will be the first clear change of government since 1955

JDP leaders have begun stressing cooperation and continuity in foreign policy and the US relationship (US alliance has
75% plus support)

A pattern of alwayvisiting Japan on the way to and from China for the President and sects of state andefense would yield
big emotional dividends in strengthening the alliance
