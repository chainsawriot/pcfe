Many thanks. Got the call readout.
           Will get team focused on using the period between now and Athens (OSCE) to do so.
Safe travels,

Jim and Phil--

  I returned his call and discussed the Macedonia name issue, Cyprus, and relations w Turkey. There's a memcon that
reflects his stated commitment to solve or improve status of these issues.

 I've known him a long time and will be happy to follow up w him on any and all of these matters w your guidance. He
seems determined to put points on the board to have a fast start so we should intensify our efforts w him. Let me know
what else you want me to do. Thx.
