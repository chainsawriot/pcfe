In a call last Tuesday, Hillary asked me to get her                                      resume. It is attached.




Hope you're both doing well â€” this most recent trip certainly has played well. Great job, but I know how unrelentingly
demanding it is for everyone on the team. HRC did mention ongoing challenges in staffing. Good luck and let me know
anything I can do from the outside.
