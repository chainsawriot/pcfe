Sounds good -- and I apologize about all of the private meetings today, I should have done a separate schedule for you.
2:30pm is Ken Feinberg.
4pm is Lou D'Allesandro dropping by for a quick hello.
6pm is General Keane and he knows we will get back to him about location. 6pm is the earliest he can do today.

I told Andrew I would do the things he requested in his memo to me and he should talk to you about scheduling.
