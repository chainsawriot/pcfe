More clarity. No awards given yet. More dealing with good governance rather than democracy. NEA worked with F and
H on a plan of how to work with a broad segment of society in Libya. It was that plan that went forth for congressional
notification. So NEA, F, and H all signed out the plan for congressional notification. While the plan took all summer to
develop, obviously it shouldn't have gone forth on automatic pilot after Meghrahi.

Congress earmarked 2.5 mil dollars for democracy stuff in Libya. Not an Admin request. Requirement to work through
NGOs. Requests for proposals went out, came in, were evaluated. One was going to an NGO with links to an NGO in
Libya run by a Qadhafi. Congressional staff briefed on Monday. Thus the questions now.
