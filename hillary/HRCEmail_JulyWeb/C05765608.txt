SEOUL (AP) - Navy ships of the two Koreas exchanged fire November 10 along their disputed western sea
border, South Korean military officers said.
A South Korean warship shot at a North Korean navy ship that crossed the disputed western sea border on the
morning of November 10 and the North's ship shot back, said an officer at the Seoul's Joint Chiefs of
Staff. Another officer said there were no South Korean casualties, though it was unclear whether there were
any on the North Korean side. He said that the North Korean ship was seriously damaged and that it turned
back toward northern waters after the brief skirmish. Both officers spoke on condition of anonymity, citing
department policy.
