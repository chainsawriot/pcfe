Huma, Jake, Joe, S Specials --
                                                                                                         1.4(D)
Two things that might be of interest to S:                                                               B1

1) I had a long secure call with Senator Mitchell this morning. He will be preparing a written report with
recommendations to convey to her at the beginning of the week. But he's had a difficult series of meetings. I
can brief her if she likes.


2) Henry Kissinger has asked to speak to me this morning. (Not me personally -- the NEA Assistant Secretary;
he doesn't know me from Adam.) Netanyahu is calling him at 10 a.m., so he asked to speak to me at 9
a.m. Kissinger does not know the subject of the Netanyahu call. I talked with Senator Mitchell about this, to
see what might be useful for Kissinger to say to Netanyahu.
