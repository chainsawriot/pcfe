Suzanne and I had a very construtive and frank discussion with Richard Goldstone this morning.



We will provide you with added details later but as general background for you, we did outline our concerns about the
report to him and our concerns about the UN process. We also talked about next steps, focused on moving away from
the UN and more toward appropriate responses by each of the parties.
