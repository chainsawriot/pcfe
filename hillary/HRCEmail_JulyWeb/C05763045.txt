All,

EAP is still waiting on confirmation on whether former Philippines President Aquino's funeral will be a private affair or
whether it will be necessary to send a presidential delegation.

In preparation for a presidential delegation, EAP has recommended the following individuals to serve as delegates.

2) Sen Richard Lugar

 3) Sen Daniel Inouye

4) Amb Michael Armacost: currently a fellow at Stanford, served as Ambassador to the Philippines from 1982-1984

 5) Amb Nicholas Platt: former foreign service officer, served as Ambassador to the Philippines from 1987-1991

 6) Amb Frank Wisner: served as Vice Chairman for AIG until retiring in Feb 09, served as Ambassador to the Philippines
 from 1991-1992

 7) Richard Armitage: former Deputy Secretary of State; involved in the Valerie Plame scandal after acknowledging that
 he was the one responsible for leaking Plame's name to the press
