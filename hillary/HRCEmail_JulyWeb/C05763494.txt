Huma,

As I mentioned to you both before,                   told me in our interview a couple of weeks ago that she was now            B5
only interested in two jobs, both of which are out of reach:                                                                    B6
                             and                  (name in play). I tried to interest her in other things at State and USAID,
but she also insists on SES status, which further limits her options given the freeze on SES positions at State. She didn't
seem interested in        at any level.

She left saying that she was very disappointed that she hadn't gotten one of her two top preferences and that maybe
she should just stay in her current job, which she loves and which gives her much more money and status than we can
offer. Given her original aspirations for an Under or Assistant Secretary position, I can't imagine that she'd be happy as
                           for instance, if one were to open up. But let me know if you think she'd be more flexible in the
end.

Margaret
