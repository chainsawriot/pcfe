I will forward Hugo's latest note. As Monty Python would say, "It's not dead yet."

Big fight over forming national unity government. Both sides taking maximalist positions, and our friends in the region are
not helping. Rio Group statement emboldened Zelaya and caused the de factos to dig in.

We might need S and Secretary Solis to call Zelaya and convince him to participate in forming the unity government.

TEGUCIGALPA - Ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya said an accord to end a political crisis has failed after de
