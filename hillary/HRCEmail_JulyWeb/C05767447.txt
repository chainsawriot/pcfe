Re: Latest on EU presidency


The political timing on the EU presidency is accelerating. Sarkozy and Merkel are meeting tonight (October 18)
to discuss it. The Czech constitutional court will issue its verdict on the legality of the Lisbon treaty on
November 3. Shortly after, perhaps that week, before you meet with Merkel on November 8-9, there may be an
EU Council meeting to decide the matter. So you may want to weigh in before then.

Tony is somewhat downcast on his chances. (He met with Jim Hoagland of the Washington Post yesterday; his
mood was described to me.) The Tories have ramped up their campaign against himâ€”not only do they not want
him but they also do not want an effective EU president. Cameron has come down on the side of the anti-EU
wing of his party on this, an easy move. In an intriguing complication, there's talk now of David Miliband
becoming EU foreign secretary if Tony does not become EU president. Miliband denied he was interested and
endorsed Tony. This is part of the anti-Blair campaign ginned up by the Tories, extended to hurt Miliband if
they can. Jonathan Powell is less gloomy than Tony, thinks everything is still in play, which is why your part in
this may yet be important.
