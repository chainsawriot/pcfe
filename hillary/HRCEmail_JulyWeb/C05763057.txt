Jake:


S asked Tom and me in the hall this morning how we were doing on Honduras. We noted that we have been
working behind the scenes to encourage both sides in Honduras to accept the Arias proposal and to support a
confidence-building visit to Honduras by a group of trusted Central American foreign ministers to prepare the
ground for an Arias deal, including Zelaya's return under the Arias framework.

Today, Tom and I have been on the phone with the Centrals and others to continue this effort. One
blip: Micheletti publicly backed away today from his positive comments yesterday about the Arias plan. We
worked with the Panamanians to get this fixed and there are unconfirmed reports that M has corrected
himself. Meanwhile, the OAS meeting today turned into a non-event — just as we hoped. We want Arias out
front. We will keep at it.

Best,

ck
