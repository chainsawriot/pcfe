Cheryl:

Had a good meeting with Holbrooke and team today. He was very nice and wanted me to let the Secretary know he was
cooperating well with me. (thanks for that!) We are focused on the S trip and equally focused on a credible plan that can
be explained on the Hill and will be sustainable. I am on board to lead an energy policy dialogue in Pakistan on 10-20/21
but we will have a package ready for S much sooner of course.

Best,

David
