I would like to keep this close hold please:

Former Panamanian VP/FM Sam Lewis just called to say he and former President Torrijos have been talking informally to
Presidents Colom, Funes and Ortega. He said all three are concerned about finding a way forward in Honduras and that
they realize elections must be part of the picture. They think the president-elect of Honduras will have a chance to
pursue national reconciliation, including a unity government. They also said the region needs better mechanisms to
head off coups and wondered about amending the IADC.

I told Sam about our step by step package approach and the vital role of elections in that package. Keep an eye out for
our statement today, I added. We have always believed in changing the Honduran dynamic one move at a time -- he
agreed. I noted that many Hondurans have talked of an eventual national dialogue to address social inclusion. Sam said
Pathways could be a great vehicle for Honduras in that regard, and I said we were already looking at the Honduran
chairmanship of Pathways Working Group One as an opportune way forward.

In the short run, I said, it would be important for Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua to avoid negative statements
about the elections and to say positive things after Monday if the vote goes smoothly.

Sam agreed to pass that message and said he would stay in touch.
