Jack, Cheryl, Piper:

Last night, I heard from the Secretary General of the OECD. He offered me the job as Deputy Secretary General . I
accepted with delight and excitement. I want to thank each of you personally for your help along the way. You've
navigated the bureaucratic waters for me and seen this through to a happy conclusion. I'll look forward to working
closely with you in the new job, and have already hooked up with Karen Kornbluh with pledges of mutual
cooperation. My plan is to retire in October and get to Paris in early November. If I can, I'd like to stop by and consult
with you before I head out.


Thanks again. Free meals in Paris whenever you can make it.


Richard
