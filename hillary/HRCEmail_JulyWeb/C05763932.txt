Hi Huma !

It was great to see you in Delhi .

I just wanted to say " thank you " for helping me attend a couple of very special events in India where Hillary spoke.

She was as amazing as ever and the Indian people are still buzzing over her visit. It was a definite home run.

Please let me know if I can ever be helpful to you since I live and work in India and will spend lots of time traveling around the
country particularly in rural areas .

Take care and all the best.

Sincerely, Dave
