Jake, Joe,

FYI, the UN Secretary General (SYG) has taken first steps towards an international commission of inquiry into the
violence in Guinea with the dispatch of A /SYG Mekerios to the region. He will travel first to ECOWAS, then to Guinea as
commission will need some level of cooperation from the authorities to gain access to the country.
