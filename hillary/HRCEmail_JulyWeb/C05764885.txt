Cheryl, Thank You again.

Steve, I am absolutely delighted to have you in our team. You come with a great credential and I am very thankful to
Secretary Clinton, and Cheryl for bringing you to MCC. We have a lot of work ahead of us but together I believe we could
bring MCC to the next stage. I will be in DC starting early next week and will let you know in advance so that we could
spend time together. If you need to reach me, please feel free to call me anytime at                 Thank You.
Daniel

Cheryl, thanks for connecting us. More importantly, thanks to Secretary Clinton and to you for your confidence in us as
we move forward with the MCC. It's a very exciting time, and a very exciting challenge!



Daniel, I am very pleased to meet you virtually, and look forward to
meeting you in person next week. Please let me know a convenient time
and we'll get together.

It is probably best to use my personal email so my current colleagues
don't get too jumpy! So you can reach me at:




Thanks!

 Daniel and Steve:
 First, congratulations to you both. The Secretary is very excited
about your pending service as CEO and Deputy at the MCC. She knows
that you will do a great job in providing the vision, leadership and
support MCC deserves in navigating the complex world of elevating
development in the context of our foreign policy.

 I wanted to introduce the two of you by email so you could reach out
to each other and coordinate connecting. I know Daniel will be in
Washington starting next week for a period, and will be coordinating
with you all to schedule time to see you as convenient.

I know the Secretary also will want to make sure she has a chance to
connect with you both as well.
Looking forward to next week.
 Best.
