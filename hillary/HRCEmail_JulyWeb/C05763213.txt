To all -- the message below is from Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh. Maura Connelly and I had dinner with him
last night, and                  by the headline put on Matthew Lee's AP piece on Judeh's visit. (The headline said that
Judeh rejected U.S. approach to Middle East peace; the story itself was fine.)
