Subject: Re: Age discrim suit

This is what we know: Bloomberg News contacted the Department's press office on Friday afternoon about an age discrimination suit
that was supposedly filed on Friday in the federal district court for DC. We do not yet have a copy of the complaint and we do not
know as yet whether the US Attorney's Office has in fact been served (an AUSA contact of ours did confirm that a complaint was filed
with the clerk of the court).

The details are also sketchy, but the complaint was apparently filed by                     an FSO. According to the inquiry that came
in from the press office,        apparently alleges that she was the top pick for a position at our Embassy in Algiers, but that she was
denied the position by HR because of her age. This complaint was filed directly in district court; neither S/OCR nor our office have
any record of an administrative complaint being filed.

Our usual practice is not to comment publicly about matters in litigation. If a complaint has in fact been filed, we should have it
sometime tomorrow, and can send you an info memo with more details. But this is all we know right now.
