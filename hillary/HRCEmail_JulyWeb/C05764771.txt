SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSFIED

UNESCO Vote

      •                                                                                                                          B5
                                                In the subsequent meeting, 10 reported that
                                                                                                                        There
           is a proposal now to invalidate the whole election.
                                                                                                                     1.4(D)

Congressional Issues

      ®    Mike Polt reported that six nominees are on deck to come up for a vote tonight — Hormats, Posner, Feinstein
           (Poland), Jacobson (Canada), White (Norway) and Solomont (Spain). Hormats will attend the G-20 if confirmed.

      ®    Jim said that he had spoken to Senator DeMint about holds on Valenzuela and Shannon. DeMint did not say
           anything negative about either nominee, but will insist on a full floor discussion as the price of a vote. (He sees
           no prospect Zelaya will come back into power in Honduras.) H will follow up to see what more can be done to
           engage with DeMint on the substance of his concerns. Cheryl noted that if we are not going to make any
           additional movement soon, we should proceed to a floor vote. The issue then will be how much time DeMint
           demands.

South Africa

      •    Pat reported that our embassy in Pretoria is closed today pending a beef-up in local security. They have taken
           other measures to increase security.

Honduras

      ®    In Honduras, Pat noted that the mission is also closed and that, despite the proximity of our mission to the
           Brazilian things seem fine. I noted that there were reports this morning that police had fired tear gas to break
           up a demonstration. WHA reported in the subsequent meeting that we have urged the de facto regime to act
           with restraint and not use force. We are also waiting for a readout of a meeting between Zelaya's supporters
           and de facto regime members that took place last night. Jim indicated he wanted to call everyone together later
           to review our strategy going forward.
