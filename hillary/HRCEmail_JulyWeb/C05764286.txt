Great news--

The video that S taped this am will likely kick off the World Food Prize conference. I will also coordinate with Katie to
make sure we get this up on the website.

Below is more info on its likely placement from the team at the World Food Prize.

"We would like to show the Secretary's remarks at the outset of the symposium on the afternoon of Wednesday,
October 14. The symposium begins at 1 p.m. with about 15-20 minutes of introductory comments by Ambassador
Quinn. He would incorporate the video into this opening as her remarks tie together so many of the themes so
perfectly. Dr. Ejeta will be on stage at the time; it would be a great moment to honor him, to remember Dr. Borlaug,
and to have the Secretary's message foreground the discussions that will follow. (For your reference, the 3 opening
keynotes will be delivered by ADM CEO Patricia Woertz, DuPont CEO Ellen Kul!man, and Dutch Minister of Agriculture
Gerda Verburg.)"
