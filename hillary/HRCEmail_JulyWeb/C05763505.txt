Sensitive but Unclassified

New York City

    •     Jack raised the issue of a proposal from Senator Schumer to reimburse New York for the loss of property tax
          revenue on diplomatic residences.                                                                                        B5
                                                                                            Jack said he would be glad to
          call Schumer about this, and would like to intervene before this becomes a public dispute.

Merida Initiative

    •     Both Jack and Jim voiced misgivings over the current state of the Merida Initiative report needed for the release
          of the last 15 percent of the allocated resources. Jim noted that, in effect, this is a certification. He said that
          there is still insufficient transparency on the part of the Mexicans and that it is unclear that their proposal to try
          alleged military human rights violations in military courts covers the full range of potential transgressions. Jim
          said he would have a meeting later this morning to review with WHA, INL, H and others what needed to be
          added, but the goal is to turn it around as quickly as possible and ensure that we do not lose out on the 15
          percent.

Somalia

    •     Jack said that he had looked at the draft OFAC letter on humanitarian assistance to Somalia and thought it went
          about as far as possible in addressing the concerns of USAID, short of granting a license in advance for any
          actions that might inadvertently provide material support to terrorist groups. In essence, the OFAC letter tells
          AID that they do not need authorization to proceed as they plan. The concern is that USAID may not be fully
          satisfied and may try to re-litigate the issue. L was going to join AID in a meeting later today to discuss and
          would seek to persuade them to accept the answer they had received from OFAC.

Colombia

    •     Jim voiced his displeasure over a cable from WHA on the proposed U.S.-Colombia Defense Cooperation
          Agreement. I can provide you more details on the high side if you want, but in essence he noted that the policy
          has not been fully thought out and that there needs to be a full policy review before we provide such guidance
          to the field.

   •     Jim asked me where we stood on the milair request for the OAS delegation to Honduras. I said everyone is on
         board, but that the paper work has still not been blessed. Jim stressed that, contrary to SOUTHCOM plans, the
         plane should not be a "blue and white" with United States of America boldly marked all over it, but rather a
         regular white plane or other military aircraft. I undertook to convey this to all concerned.

Aung San Suu Kvi

   •     Jim noted that the Secretary had made a good statement on the decision to sentence ASSK to house arrest for
         another 18 months, but stressed to PA the need for them to coordinate closely with the White House today on
         what more we say.
