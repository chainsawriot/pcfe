Still working this through, but here is where we are thus far:

The majority of all countries that have direct presidential elections use a Two-Round system. The number appears to be
at least 58.

France, most Latin American countries, all five post-Soviet Central Asian republics, and many countries in francophone
Africa use TRS to elect their presidents. Elsewhere in Africa the system is used by Angola, Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana,
Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Sao Tome and Principe, the Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Sudan,
Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe; in Europe, apart from France, it is used by Armenia, Azerbaijan, Austria, Belarus,
Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Finland, Georgia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia
and Ukraine; and it is found in Afghanistan, Haiti, Indonesia, Iran, Timor-Leste and Yemen.
