This is kennedy statement about to go out. Will be joint from u and wjc.

Senator Ted Kennedy was one of the most important and influential leaders of our time, whose five decades as Senator
from Massachusetts helped to shape America's history and chart our shared future. During our time in the White
House, we were thankful for his fierce advocacy and support for universal health care and his work to provide health
coverage to low-income children. Without his tireless efforts, America would not be as close to achieving health care
reform as we are today.Continuing the legacy left by his older brothers, his lifelong pursuit of civil rights and justice for
all moved America forward to form a more perfect union. But beyond his death, his legacy of public service will live on in
millions of young people across our nation who now have the chance to serve through the Edward M. Kennedy Serve
America Act, which will expand AmeriCorps and other youth service opportunities. He loved his country, his wife Vicki,
and his incredible children and grandchildren. We are proud to have known him, worked alongside him, and called him
our friend. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and the people of Massachusetts during this difficult time.
