Hillary, having followed your India visit closely—and, of course, the follow-up coverage on
issues you covered there—I've got a couple of thoughts, one in particular re India-Pakistan, that
I'd like to discuss with you at your convenience (if there is such a thing) in August. I'll be back
in DC from Aspen on August 7 and here through Labor Day if there's any chance of
connecting. Strobe
