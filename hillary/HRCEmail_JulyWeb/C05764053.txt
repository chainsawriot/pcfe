Cheryl, Jake:

Despite the nailbiting finale, the Human Rights Council reentry has been remarkably successful. The tally, with returns
still coming in:

1. Goldstone-report deferred through extraordinary political work by all of you 2. Freedom of Expression--tonsensus--a
landmark achievement in suggesting that there is indeed a universal understanding of freedom of expression that can
cut across cultural lines 3. Honduras: consensus 4. Womens' Equality-consensus 5. Human Security issues: US took
forward leaning posture USG engaged across the board and got the results it wanted--5 for 5--plus appeared principled
and balanced To be honest if we had gotten any 2 of these, I would have felt relieved. Instead we ran the table. There
was a stunning performance by 10-DRL-L-AmEmbassy Geneva and various regional bureaus, particularly NEA and WHA
and AF, as well as EUR. The State Department at its finest and multilateral diplomacy executed at a macro and micro
level. Brimmer, Nossel, Posner all were outstanding as were our folks in Geneva.

And this is in our first reengagement. It should get better as we gain more experience.
