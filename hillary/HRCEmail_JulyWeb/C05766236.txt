I didn't - but hard to believe he did. I was pretty surprised myself when I read the piece.

Just shows you that it's near impossible to take issue with the job you're doing it, which is why the political reporters
have to resort to the manufactured drama of interactions with the WH.

Face was good. Perfect in that it generated no issues to clean up, but other networks picked up clips re Iran.

Gates's remark that he couldn't send any new troops before January to Afghanistan seems to be the only thing
approaching news.

I saw WJC on Meet (VERY good, and a lot about CGI's work re women and girls), but I missed Paterson!
