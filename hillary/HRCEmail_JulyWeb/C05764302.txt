BERLIN (Dow Jones)--The German government is awaiting the outcome of a meeting of General Motors Co.'s board of
directors later Friday that will discuss the sale of its German unit Adam Opel GmbH.


The government will then assess what it believes will be a fundamental signal on which of the two remaining bids for the
unit the company favors, economics ministry spokeswoman Beatrix Brodkorb said Friday.


The meeting is due to take place in the afternoon, central European time, according to the government.

Austrian-Canadian car parts maker Magna International Inc. (MGA), in a consortium with Russian savings banks OAO
Sberbank (SBER.RS), and Belgian private equity firm RHJ International SA (RHJI.BT) have recently presented revised
bids for Opel and its sister company, U.K.-based Vauxhall.


Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is keen to rescue jobs at Opel ahead of the Sept. 27 general election, has
lobbied hard for Magna to be win the bid, while GM in the past has preferred RHJ.


Government spokesman Klaus Vater said Friday that there is currently "some movement," and Brodkorb said the
government has been in contact with the U.S. on Opel over the past 24 hours.


Brodkorb stressed that Germany's offer to provide the entire EUR4.5 billion in state aid for Opel came after GM asked
Germany to provide more details on aid for the Magna bid but made no request for more state aid details for RHJ.


The offer to pay state subsidies entirely and upfront without other European countries that have Opel and Vauxhall plants
"is an offer to other countries to help get a fast decision," Brodkorb said.


Other European countries with Opel plants include Spain, the U.K., Poland and Belgium.


The U.K. government is reportedly irritated by Germany's offer to entirely shoulder state guarantees of up to EUR4.5
billion in the deal because a decision on state aid wouldn't be up to Germany alone since the Opel bids also involve
Vauxhall and production sites in Spain and Poland.


Opel has around 50,000 staff in Europe, of which around half are based in Germany.
