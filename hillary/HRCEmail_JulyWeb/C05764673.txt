           r direct office line
                assistant Karen answers that phone.
T
She m
    has been
         een in Russia and just got back yesterday.

The cell number we had for her is outdated.
Her office is going to call me back with a new cell number. (I think her assistant wants to get her approval before she
gives it to me). I'll update our records when we get it.
