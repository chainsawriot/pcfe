Sorry -- just seeing. In short, they might have made a bad word choice. They should have said "reconcile" instead of
"achieve both." But having done it, they've got to play out the string with the Pals, who would be suspicious of the
change. But if AM says no on Monday, Mitchell is open to changing it. If AM miraculously says yes, then they'll have the
leverage to push it through with BN. Can elaborate on plane.

They didn't admit they made a bad word choice - that's my interpretation.
