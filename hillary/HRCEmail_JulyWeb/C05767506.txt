Ted and Drew,

This evening at approximately 5:30pm local time, I received a call from Argentine judge Federico Summer of Neuquen
province (borders Chile in southwest Argentina). He advised me that on Monday, November 23, 2009, a 16-year old

local boy discovered the decomposed body of a male in a remote wooded area overlooking the lake in the Patagonian
town of San Martin de los Andes. The judge mentioned he had seen last week's television interview
(http://www.infobae.comkienera1/485486-601275-0-Un-norteamericano-desaparecido-hace-casi-dos-meses-el-
packCYADADs) in which I described Roberto Yaryura's disappearance on September 19, 2009, and he remembered the
photo of the unique tattoo on Roberto's right arm mentioned in the interview and widely published in the national
media here throughout Argentina.

The judge sent me the pictures of the body taken at the location where it was found, and I sent one picture, a close-up
shot of the tattooed right arm to Roberto's best friend (who recently flew down here for 10 days to search for him) for
identification. He and the artist who designed the unique tattoo, also one of Roberto's best friends, confirmed for me
over the phone that it was, indeed, Roberto's tattoo in the photo.

I notified Roberto's siblings,                                                       together with their families, and they
asked me
until after their sister had given her the news in person later tonight. I confirmed that I would wait until tomorrow to
contact                 to discuss her preference for disposition of Roberto's body and transfer of the remains.

Judge Summer noted that they are conducting an autopsy on Roberto's body to rule out foul play, and that the case is
now considered an open criminal investigation until the autopsy results determine he died of natural causes. Local
medics estimate the time of death to be approximately thirty to forty days prior the body's discovery. The judge added
that he would do everything possible to expedite any necessary paperwork with respect to disposition of the body once
they have ruled out any criminal aspect to this case.                          would like to fly down next week, if
possible, to pick up his remains to bring them back to the United States.

I would like to thank my colleagues in Uruguay, Brazil, Paraguay, and Bolivia, copied here, for all their efforts to track
down Roberto. In my conversation with the siblings, they wanted me to pass on their gratitude to everyone for their
efforts to find Roberto.

Best,
Shannon
