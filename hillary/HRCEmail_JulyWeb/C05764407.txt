Yes it is at variance, perhaps not surprising. However, post is also involved so we will be getting another assessment.

Glamour has provided an excellent update and the good news is that Nujood is in private school and attending regularly.

Dear Melanne,

We've been in contact with Salam Alshehri, the project coordinator of the newly launched Entelak school program
Glamour helped create for young girls through Sana'a's Girls World Communication Center. She reports that they are in
contact with Nujood who is in fact in third grade at a private school. While Nujood isn't in the demographic for the
Entelak Project since she's still young enough for public (free) education, she is the role model for the targeted girls.
And since Nujood is the spirit of the Project, Salam and her colleagues are thinking of ways to include her in the activities
and trainings as much as possible.

We've also spoken to Delphine Minoui, the French reporter who first covered Nujood's case and has since co-written
Nujood's autobiography. Delphine has taken on the funding of Nujood's private schooling and confirms that Nujood is in
fact still attending school. CNN got it wrong apparently,




Let me know if you'd like to brainstorm about other ways to help support Nujood.

All best,
Susan
