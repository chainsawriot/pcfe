Subject: greetings to you!

sister Secretary,




hope you are well and enjoying the blessings of The Lord!




i was hanging out with the girls this weekend at                           - what a great time! -- and i got to chat with
cheryl a bit about what's happening with the religious freedom office. i was very glad to learn what was going on --
though not so glad to hear about the challenges you are now facing there. anyway, i wanted you to know that i have
been approached by                                                                              they are moving pretty
quickly but i expect to get a firm offer in the next few days and i will need to get back to them quickly.




                                               i'll continue to try and stay connected to cheryl -- she has got to be
one of the hardest working woman in washington!
