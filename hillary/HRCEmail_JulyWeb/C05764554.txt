I'll follow up

Might make most sense for WJC to issue a quote that talks about you too, like the Howard one

Jay--Congratulations! I am also a BIG fan of the mayor's and delighted he will have your help. I think this is ok, but I'm
copying Huma and Philippe to double check thru all the rules I have to follow. If ok, they can work w you on the actual
quote. Good luck. H

Subject: Hello--quick question

Madarhe secretary (that's still fun to say):

I hope you're doing well and at least getting a little down time this summer.

I have some news for you and a quick question to ask.

In a couple weeks I will be leaving steve's company to take a job in mayor villaraigosa's administration. Specifically I'll be
the chief deputy mayor and one of the top two staffers in the city. He's looking to reinvigorate and refocus his mayoralty
and I'm excited to help him do that and I'm really excited about the opportunity to help govern from an executive
position.

I also have a strong affinity for him in no small part because of how loyal he was to you during the primary.

That's the news -- the question is that I've just learned they'll be announcing this tomorrow and I wanted to see if
perhaps you'd be willing to give a quote for the release.
And I do know you have a world to continue putting back together so if this isn't possible for any reason I completely
understand.

All the best,
Jay
