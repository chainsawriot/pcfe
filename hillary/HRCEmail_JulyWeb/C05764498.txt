       THE PRIME MINISTER                                            21 October 2009

              I promised to write to you setting out the elements of the financial
        settlement that you agreed to present to your respective parties. Our
        discussions on the finances have been careful, detailed and considered
        and I am grateful to you for the time you have given to them. Together
        we have, I believe, achieved an outcome in which we each have
        confidence and which will ensure that when policing and justice powers
        are transferred, the Northern Ireland Justice Department will have a
        secure financial foundation which we all recognise is important in
        ensuring confidence in the policing and justice services across the
        community. I believe the settlement which is outlined below is a good
        settlement which will meet the needs of a devolved Justice Department.

               The key elements of the settlement are:

               The Northern Ireland Executive will have access to the reserve to
               meet any exceptional security pressures relating to policing and
               justice. On the same basis, HM Treasury will be prepared to make
               available up to an additional £37.4 million in 2010/11.

               Capital budgets in the next CSR period will be sufficient to enable
               the Executive to take forward routine, but necessary work, to
               maintain the operational capacity of existing assets, to complete
               the police training college and to come to its own view about the
               relative priorities for new capital expenditure including Maoilligan
               Prison and other projects in the period ahead.

               The legal aid allocation is a £20 million a year addition to baseline
               through to the end of 2012/13, after which efficiency savings will
               be expected to take effect, allowing the baseline increase to be
               reduced to £14 million a year. To meet additional pressures over

              the next two years, including other courts pressures, we agree the
              need on a one-off basis for a further £12 million. If, in the event,
              pressures turn out to be higher than this, HM Treasury will provide
              further money from the reserve up to a maximum of £39 million.
              Until the end of 2012/13 this access to the reserve will not be
              recouped from future EYF.

              HM Government will gift the four agreed former military bases to
              the Northern Ireland Executive. It would be anticipated that a
              portion of the land in Omagh will be used for an educational
              campus but it would be expected that disposal proceeds from the
              other sites would be used, on a basis agreed with HM Treasury, to
              meet exceptional resource pressures (including potentially equal
              pay claims). HM Treasury will work with the Northern Ireland
              Executive to help ensure that any timing issues, related to delays
              in securing these disposal proceeds as a consequence of market
              conditions, can be addressed on an agreed basis.

              On police pensions, previously identified pressures of £101 million
              can be fully addressed through technical changes which will
              include a public expenditure neutral DEL to AME reclassification.

              There are potential pressures (the "long list") of around £15 million
              in 2010/11 on resources relating to policing, prisons and probation.
              This should fall to around £10 million a year in the next CSR
              period. Baselines will need to be sufficient to meet these
              pressures. in addition £30 million in unallocated EYF and
              underspends generated in future years will be available to meet
              pressures.

              Prior to devolution the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and
              the head of the PSNI will agree on how front-line policing is
              protected while ensuring the greatest efficiency.

              Hearing Loss. The Northern Ireland Executive will meet .the first
              £12m of claims in any one year. Any sums incurred above that will
              be met through access to the reserve, based on annual agreement
              between the Northern Ireland Executive and HM Treasury on the
              litigation strategy. To assist the Northern Ireland Executive to meet
              the expected £12m a year pressure, the Treasury will be prepared
              to acquire from the Northern Ireland Executive sellable assets

             worth up to £12 million a year for five years, or £60 million in total.
             HM Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive will need to agree on
             the valuation methodology.

             I believe that this is a very strong settlement which will ensure that
      all the people of Northern Ireland continue to have high quality policing
      and justice services.
