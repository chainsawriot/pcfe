Jake: I echo Esther's words. This resolution resulted from yeoman work and sterling inter-bureau

Subject: Freedom of Expression - UN Human Rights

Jake,

I wanted to update you on two aspects of our work leading up to the September session at the UN Human
Rights Council where the U.S. will be a full member for the first time: 1) freedom of expression (addressed in
this email) and 2) human rights strategy at the UN (in a second email on high side).

First, I'd like to let you know about the successful next step in a strategy we are pursuing at the UN Human
Rights Council to begin to change the dialogue on Freedom of Expression. We think we have developed a
well-balanced text that we can move forward to adoption in the UN HRC's September session. This work
contributes to our long-term effort to improve this UN body. Progress on this issue would help us later as we
address the even more difficult issue of the "defamation of religions" about which the Secretary expressed
interest in a Monday senior staff meeting.

An 10-DRL-L-NEA group has been working together to implement the strategy that involves reaching
agreement with the Egyptians on a text that we will roll out late next week with countries in the OIC
(Organization of the Islamic Conference) and the WEOG (Western European and Other Group, our regional
group at the UN).

Experts in L, DRL, 10, and NEA agree that the text protects all USG red lines and offers us a workable
compromise that can secure genuine cross-regional consensus when presented in the Human Rights Council in
September, hopefully avoiding a divisive vote on this issue. US and Egyptian teams also agreed to the
possibility of further cooperation in the UNGA to come to a soft landing on defamation of religions if Cairo and
Washington first succeed in passing the FoE resolution by OIC/WEOG consensus.
