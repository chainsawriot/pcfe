Cheryl:

The 3 UNGA delegates (Ross, Webb and Schuster) passed the White House decision meeting last week.

Sharon Hardy is beginning to process them as SGE's, Senior Advisors, so they can be prepared once UNGA
begins in two weeks. They are still on track to go before the SFRC as the Committee begins holding hearings
once again.
