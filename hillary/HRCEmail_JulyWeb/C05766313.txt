For Secretary Clinton




Dear Hillary,




You will remember our initiative to bring the most senior retired generals from the Chinese and US militaries. With
these 10 generals from the two countires, I am going to be in DC on October 21 and 22. these Generals have been part
our of our Sanya Initiative - the unofficial mil-mil dialogue I started last year. It'll be me, Joe Prueher, Charley Wilhelm,
Ron Fogleman, and Denny Reimer. The Chinese will be led by General Xiong Guangkai and include four other very senior
and respected Generals from the PLA.




The Chinese view this as a formal track one program and take it very seriously. We will meet with ADM Mullen and ADM
Keating in Honolulu and see GEN Cartwright at the Pentagon. It would be a terrific sign of the U.S.'s support for this
relationship if you were able join or host (I'd be pleased to fund) a very private dinner on the evening of the 21 or the
22nd of October. Just you, the Generals, and interpreters - perhaps the Chinese Ambassador if you think that would be
valuable.

I met with Kurt Campbell last month, and we will meet with him and Jim Steinberg. He expressed strong support for this
dialogue as well as the economic one we started in Beijing last August. You know we would welcome involvement from
State at any of our projects - our goal is to make a small but meaningful difference in the relationship.




Warm best wishes, (I'm cheering for you!)




Bill
