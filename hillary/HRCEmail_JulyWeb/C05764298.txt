Thanks, Also, Sergei Kislyak told me last evening that the change in administrations here + the missile defense decision
made it much easier for Russia to be helpful on Iran last week. Re connecting, I'm off this evening to Rhodes, Athens,
Paris, Oslo, & Istanbul, but I can be reached via my office as I bounce around. Cheers, S.
