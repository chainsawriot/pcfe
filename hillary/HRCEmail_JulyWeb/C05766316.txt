We spent two hours with the Burmese this afternoon. Kurt laid out our position, and stressed that the Burmese had an
opportunity if they were willing to move, but that the window wouldn't stay open forever.

It was a substantive meeting. I don't think we could have been clearer about our position. As expected, burmese
weren't in a position to make any commitments, but said they'd take it back to the senior leadership. They focused on
the ethnic insurgencies as a source of instability.

Tone was good, and I think Kurt did a very good job laying out our points -- clear, firm, diplomatic.

Scot
