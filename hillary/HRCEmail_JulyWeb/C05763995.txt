DCA negotiations are still on for week after next (11-13 Aug), as requested.
Amb Barco called to request that we slide right one day (13,14 Aug). They requested this based on a visit of Mexican
President Calderon - who will visit Bogota (10-12 Aug). The dep FM and some MinDef officials want to be in Bogota for
Calderon's visit.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Will the DCA team be in Columbia in early August? I thought we had set that up but heard today they might not get
there until September. What's the plan?
