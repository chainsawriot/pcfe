Jonathan Powell suggests that VVJC write an article supporting Tony Blair for EU president in Die Welt, the Berlin
newspaper. If so, I suggest it be wrapped in a discussion on the future of Europe, the need for Europe to be strong as a
partner with US for many goals requiring a strong president: the policy imperatives, from climate change, security, social
integration, etc. point to Blair. Also, if done, should include description and endorsement of Blair's personal Qualities for
office. Can't be backhanded. Jonathan says Tony should call Bill soon. Sid
