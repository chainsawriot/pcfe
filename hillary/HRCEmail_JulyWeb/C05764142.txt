Subject:                             Draft for tomorrow



Am about to fax %roll the latest draft. There is still some litigating going on over Iran language, but hopefully we can
resolve it by later tonight. In any case, it's pretty far along. I'll try to do one more polish through it. Just be advised that I
n lay need to give you a clean draft overnight or early in the morning. Thx.
