I read tha        s in Philadelphia                but if she's back I'd at least like to call again. The timing, however, is
hard for a visit since I need to see Santa around 7:45 after seeing Lisa. It might work if she's there and wants to see
people other than close friends. What do you think?

Yes at 10.
Was checking to see if I needed to make arrangements for you to do anything earlier.
