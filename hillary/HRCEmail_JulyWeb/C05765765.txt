Hillary! Thank you so much. How fabulous you were on Meet the Press. I'm so proud of you. I'm in Prague on my way to
Ankara Tuesday. Started off in New Delhi on Thursday and yes, Jim will be with us at your house for dinner Friday night.
Please stay safe on your travels and I'm so thrilled to work for you.
Best,
Ellen

  HappyHappy from Shanghai! Can't wait to catch up in person at the retreat on Friday. Is your husband coming to the
dinner at my house that night? Safe travels to you too! Hillary
