Subject: Call from Arias

I just received a call from Arias. He expressed his appreciation for everything the US had done in support of democracy
in Honduras. He said the recent tough messages by Insulza, OAS Ambassadors and USG officials. strengthened by US
sanctions, was having an impact on the M regime. He praised our decision to close the consulate and urged that we also
move to take away tourist and business visas from key regime members and supporters. I told him we were working on
implementing the visa and other measures which I expected could be announced soon.

Arias was critical of Z saying his recent public statements continued to be unhelpful. He described Z's statement
advocating the death penalty (presumably to apply to his political enemies) and asking for the extension of his term in
office as "disastrous". He said that Insulza had made the right call by not allowing Z to address the OASGA. We agreed
the influence of FM Rodas over Z was highly negative,

I told Arias I would be back in Honduras tomorrow and planned in the coming days to press influential political, business
and civil society and urge support for the immediate signing of the Si Accord. Arias and I agreed to stay in close touch in
the coming days.
