Cheryl,

Great meeting you yesterday. I enjoyed the conversation and am looking forward very much to
working with you. The security interview went fine, I believe. I owe them some more information which
they will get over the weekend.

Separately I have attached a bio for                             as promised.

Talk to you soon. Thanks again,

Best wishes,
