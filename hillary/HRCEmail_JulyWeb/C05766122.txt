• We welcome the strong statements and commitments Brazil has made, including your announcements on
  forests and overall climate mitigation. It will be critical that you incorporate your policies and goals in the
  Copenhagen Accord and allow these actions to be internationally reviewed.

• Brazil has taken a leadership role in these negotiations and we hope you will continue to push other
  countries, including other major developing economies, toward a successful outcome. It will be very
  important for China to put forward robust actions beyond business-as-usual that are subject to international
  review.

Subject: Climate Change Points for Brazil

Courtney,

I've attached a call sheet on climate change for the Secretary's call with Brazil's Minister of External Relations. Please let
me know if you have any questions or concerns.

I'm copying Paul Brown, who has kindly agreed to work up call sheets for Saudi Arabia and South Africa. He will not be
able to get to this for another hour or so.

We'll discuss division of countries with Steinberg's staff and get back to you with a proposal.

Thanks,

Christ()
