Attached and below is the proposed final Retreat Agenda.

The chief challenge I see is in having each bureau give 3 minutes on their top 3 priorities.

I think it is worthwhile from the standpoint that this is the first time all will be together with the chance to see/meet and
hear from everyone, but it will take time to hear from everyone. I've broken it up into 2 sections of an hour
each. Without these sections, the Retreat would breathe — with them it's tight though I have left padding in each
section.

I also am holding a place for up front for Susan Rice to present if she comes — she has not rsvped.

Please see below and attached and advise if there are other suggested changes.

Bill Burns cannot attend the retreat and currently will give his update on Iran to Jim; we also will have Jim address Iraq in
his overview too.
