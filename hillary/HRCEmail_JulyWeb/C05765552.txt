Iran charges three detained Americans with espionage

(Adds background)
TEHRAN, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Iran has charged three detained U.S. citizens with espionage, the official IRNA news agency
quoted a judiciary official as saying on Monday. "The three are charged with espionage. Investigations continue into the
three detained Americans in Iran," Tehran general prosecutor Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi said. The three were held after
they strayed into Iran from northern Iraq at the end of July. The three, Shane Bauer, 27, Sarah Shourd, 31, and Josh
Fattal, 27, crossed into Iranian territory nearly two months ago. Their families say they strayed across the border
accidentally. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad suggested in an interview with the American television network
NBC in September that the Americans' release might be linked to the release of Iranian diplomats he said were being
held by U.S. troops in Iraq. Under Iran's Islamic sharia law, espionage is punishable by death.
