Hi. We have a 12 hour time difference. So I was sound asleep when you sent this at nearly 2 am Manila time(smile). Just
got it now - we are having blackberry troubles and I am in the southern Philippines, not back in Manila until Monday.

Do you need to talk to me? If so we can figure out a time that works.

Hope all is well with you. Secretary Clinton's video greeting was a smash success here. Still playing on TV and radio here.
