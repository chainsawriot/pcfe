Madam Secretary,

It was terrific to see you the other day for the photo shoot with the ambassador designees. Elaine and I are
excited -- and grateful to you -- for the opportunity.

As we discussed, I am in the building, working out of the transition office as the confirmation process inches
forward. Elaine and I are busy gearing up but, as we discussed, I am happy to pitch in on specific projects or
anything else if the need arises. In the meantime, best wishes to you and your family.

Best,
Lee
