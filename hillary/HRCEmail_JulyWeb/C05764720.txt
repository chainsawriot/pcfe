Cheryl,

Rich wanted to be sure I flag this for you.




Again, just flagging for you. His hearing is today. Maybe he gets by, but I'm still very concerned going in.

Feingold reportedly expressed some reservations about the nomination but said he was keeping an open mind. Frankly,
that's not a great sign, since he's been overwhelmingly positive in his meetings with just about all our other candidates.

I can report that H has done just about everything we can do. We've done countless meetings and briefings and had
several mock hearing sessions. That's in addition to all the work on QFRs, counsel questions, testimony, and his SFRC
questionairre. But despite all this work, I still have some very serious concerns heading into tomorrow's confirmation
hearing.
