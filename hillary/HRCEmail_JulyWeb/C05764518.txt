                          STATEMENT BY IAN KELLY, SPOKESMAN

                Temporary Suspension of Non-Immigrant Visa Services in Honduras


  The OAS Foreign Ministers mission is in Honduras seeking support for the San Jose Accord,
  which would restore the democratic and constitutional order and resolve the political crisis in
  Honduras. In support of this mission and as a consequence of the de facto regime's reluctance to
  sign the San Jose Accord, the U.S. Department of State is conducting a full review of our visa
  policy in Honduras. As part of that review, we are suspending non-emergency, non-immigrant
  visa services in the consular section of our embassy in Honduras, effective August 26. We
  firmly believe a negotiated solution is the appropriate way forward and the San Jose Accord is
  the best solution.
