I'm reading an old Entertainment Weekly and came across a promotional photo of Hope Davis and Dennis Quaid as you
and President Clinton (along with Michael Sheen and Helen McCrory as the Blairs), for the HBO movie called "The Special
Relationship" (due in the spring) - thought you'd get a kick out of seeing a photo of the photo, attached

In the caption, Hope Davis says, "They made special teeth for me because Hillary's are very unique. When I popped
them in, I suddenly looked very much like her."
