Madam Secretary,

You did a really fine job on Meet the Press today. The Russia, Iran, Afghanistan and Asia points were all right
on the mark. And even though it goes beyond my professional scope, the second half was just as good. Enjoy
the rest of the weekend.

   Thanks for the update and for all the work you did and led to get us to this
point. I hope you'll have time to send me periodic updates, especially your
impressions of the Medvedev-Putin relationship.

   I am considering a trip to the Caucusus and Central Asia in the Fall, perhaps
attached to the Russia bilat, if we decide that makes sense.

   Travel safely. All the best, Hillary

Madam Secretary,

Just a quick note before leaving for Moscow, Rome and Central Asia.

Moscow preparations are in reasonable shape. Afghan lethal transit agreement is
done, and will be signed on Monday. There's also a broader statement on
cooperation on counter-narcotics and reconstruction in Afghanistan. (Bakiyev
has now sianed the Manas aareement. which is a further boost on Afahanistan                                1.4(B)

Presidents will announce the bilateral commission, and your trip to Russia in
the fall to launch the process with Lavrov. All in all, a good, measured,

I'll be in Rome just for the first, "foreign policy" portion of the G8. We're
working on a Leaders' statement that is likely to look a lot like last week's G8
Foreign Ministers statement on most issues, with an update on North Korea, and
essentially the same, firm line on Iran.

I leave Rome on July 9 with an interagency delegation for stops in Kazakhstan,
Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan, back in DC on July 14.

Hope you had a good Fourth, and all the best,

Bill
