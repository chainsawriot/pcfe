U.N. asks Afghanistan to lift election media ban
KABUL, Aug 19 (Reuters) - The United Nations has asked Afghanistan to lift a last-minute ban on media reporting of
violence during Thursday's presidential election, saying the Afghan constitution guaranteed a free press. Afghan
authorities imposed the ban on Tuesday with two decrees, the first barring journalists from reporting any violence in the
country between 6:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. (0130-1530 GMT) on polling day. The second ordered journalists to stay away
from the scenes of any attacks. The government says the measures are intended to prevent reports of violence from
scaring Afghans away from voting. Taliban fighters have vowed to disrupt the election. The United Nations said Afghans
had a right to information, and restricting the media could undermine confidence in the poll. "People need access to
information, not only on polling day but after polling day. The credibility of these elections is directly linked to the
information that they have access to," said Aleem Siddique, spokesman for the U.N. mission in Kabul. "Its unclear to us
what if any legal basis there would be for such a directive when Afghanistan's constitution guarantees freedom of
expression and freedom of the press. We are making this point to the Afghan authorities," he said on
Wednesday. Afghan police have taken a more aggressive attitude towards reporters in recent days. Several journalists
were beaten by police at the scene of a suicide car bombing on Tuesday and a siege with gunmen on Wednesday.
