GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip - (AP) Palestinian militants in Gaza have agreed to stop firing rockets into southern Israel. Hamas
announced the agreement this evening, saying it's intended to prevent Israeli retaliation and give Gaza residents more
stability. Hamas' interior minister says it should make it easier for residents to rebuild the infrastructure that was
destroyed in last winter's war with Israel. Hamas has mostly refrained from firing rockets since Israel's three-week
offensive ended in January. Some Gaza militant groups have continued with rocket attacks since the end of the war, but
they've been far less frequent. The latest came this morning, but it caused no injuries. A small faction affiliated with al-
Qaida claimed responsibility.
