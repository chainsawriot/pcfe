Jake/Huma, please see below. Have either/both of these come in to you for consideration?

Separately, as I think you know (but just to be sure), Jim will be on travel next week, Monday evening - very early Friday
morning. He'll be back in the office on Friday. Could you please also make sure Cheryl is aware?

Best, Sheba
