Russia to help Ecuador develop nuclear energy
 QUITO (Reuters) - Russia will help Ecuador develop a nuclear energy program for peaceful purposes according to a new
energy cooperation agreement between the two countries, the Ecuadorean government said Thursday. "Yesterday the
ministry of electricity and renewable energy signed a memorandum of understanding with the Russian State Atomic
Energy Corporation (Rosatom) ... to carry out research in technologies and nuclear devices that may effectively be used
in our country," the ministry said in a statement. The ministry said that Rosatom would provide "support and
assistance" to help Ecuador draft a set of laws that will limit the use of nuclear energy to peaceful purposes only. The
statement says the deal calls for the governments of the two countries to appoint a team that would identify "the most
interesting projects to develop a nuclear industry" in the Andean country.
