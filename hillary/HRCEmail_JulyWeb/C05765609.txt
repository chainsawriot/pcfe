"He had little record but lots of rhetoric -- much of it morally stirring and beautifully written," Richard Cohen writes in his
Washington Post column. "As president, though, he has tried so hard to be the un-George Bush that the former
president's overweening moralism -- his insistence on seeing things as either black or white -- has become an Obama
gray. Human rights in general has been treated as if it's a Republican idea. Obama should reread his Philadelphia speech.
He'll find a good man there."
