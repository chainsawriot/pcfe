Thanks, Hillary. The notification was emphatically NOT a solicitation. Besides, you've already contributed such a vast
amount-to her life, and to the celebration of it.




  Happy to chat any time. I'm around all weekend. You might shoot me an email (which I'll get by BlackBerry even if I'm
not at my workbench) and let me know when you want to call, or want me to call you, or whatever.
  S.

The International Center for Research of Women (ICRW) has established a fellowship in memory of Brooke Shearer, a
former ICRW board member and dedicated advocate for improving the health and economic status of women in the
developing world. The Brooke Shearer fellowship in India is an opportunity for U.S. early career professionals with
graduate degrees to contribute to research and programs that advance gender equality and empower women in Asia.

Shearer was a stalwart supporter and contributor to ICRW's mission and work. ICRW honors her commitment to women
with a fellowship program based in our Asia Regional Office in New Delhi, India, a tribute to Shearer's fond memories of
her time spent in India during her youth and her tenure on ICRW's board.

The 2009 fellow will work in collaboration with the Asia director of the social and economic development group on

specific policy efforts in addressing sex selection and discrimination against girl children, and the potential conflict
