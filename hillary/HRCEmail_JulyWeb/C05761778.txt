Cheryl:

First of all, thank you again for the telcon and heads up, I very much appreciated the consideration
and professional courtesy.

Per our conversation, if it is still helpful, I have a couple of candidates to suggest for the deputy slot at
USAID. Perhaps you have already heard of these individuals, given that they are well known in the
international development arena.

These are all superb career officers. I know each person very well, and have seen them in various
positions where they consistently handled the most complex, difficult and important assignments in an
outstanding manner. The all have terrific reputations, and are highly regarded in USAID, State, and
on the Hill.

Regards,

Aaron
