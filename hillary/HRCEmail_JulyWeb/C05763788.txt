Hi Burns,




I received the email below from Lyn Lusi, a highly trained and experienced program administrator with HEAL Africa
(Congo). I tried to line her up to be a speaker at the Global Summit that Hillary attended, but we were unable to book
her due to scheduling issues. She's not some random, run-of-the-mill aid worker; she's really, really special, having set
up the fistula hospital and teaching hospital in Goma with her husband, Dr. Jo Lusi. Lyn sent me this email and requested
I "do what I can" to encourage Hillary to empower the indigenous physicians and trained personnel in this hospital
rather than bring in outside partners to start something new.




Blessings to you,

Kay

Conversation: Suggested letter for follow up to Mrs Clinton's visit to HEAL Africa
Subject: Suggested letter for follow up to Mrs Clinton's visit to HEAL Africa



This is Lyn Lusi writing to you from HEAL Africa in Goma and your address comes from the business card you left me
when you visited us. You may have heard that Secretary of State Mrs Clinton and Ambassador Ms Verveer came to
HEAL Africa on Tuesday 11th August. The visit went very well, and the organisation was impeccable, so she could
achieve her objectives. While in our Conference Centre, she announced a package of aid to Congo to fight Gender Based
Violence.




First she congratulated HEAL Africa on the excellent work we are doing; then she announced a deal between the US and
the Norwegian Government to build a state of the art fistula and teaching hospital in Goma.




She must have been aware of the shock and discouragement of all our staff. In effect she was saying:

"Your excellent work is not really excellent at all, and we will work with the Norwegians to replace you in North Kivu."

I seriously believe she was not properly briefed, because of some remarks she made as she was leaving.




This is now a request to you, and if possible, other members of the your organisation, if you would be so kind as to
contact them. Nothing is set in stone, and politicians respond to pressure from their friends and constituencies. We
believe that wise use of funds means building capacity among local organisations that have already proved that they can
do the work, and sustain their efforts, rather than starting something new.




I am attaching below a letter like the one we have written to Mrs Clinton and a similar one to Ambassador Verveer. If
you think it is appropriate, we are requesting you to write a similar letter to both of them. We are hoping that local
Congolese organisations will not be excluded from these resources to build local capacity on the foundations of what is
being done already.




With kind regards.

Lyn Lusi

SUGGESTED LETTER




Secretary of State Mrs Hillary Clinton

U.S. Department of State
2201 C Street NW
Washington, DC 20520




Goma, 11th August 2009




Dear Mrs Clinton,




If We       followed with interest reports of your visit to Goma on 11th August 2009, where you convened a meeting of
Congolese actors in the fight against Gender Based Violence at HEAL Africa training center. The commitment of the
people of the United States to working alongside Congolese associations for peace and human rights is heartening, after
16 years of endless war.


                                                          AO
       UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05763788 Date: 07/31/2015
      UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05763788 Date: 07/31/2015




We congratulate you for this pioneering visit which gave a voice to Congolese community based organizations, who are
often overpowered by international actors. We sincerely hope that the US government and USAID will take the next step
in working alongside community based organizations in Eastern Congo.




After studying the announcement of the package of assistance that is being prepared to contribute to fighting Gender
Based Violence in the east of Congo, we are mystified to hear that the United States and the Norwegian government
have decided to build for North Kivu a centre of excellence for training doctors in fistula repair and care of mothers.




According to good development principles, outside assistance builds on what is already in place and functioning well,
developing proven capacity and giving local actors the additional tools they need to do a better job.




As friends and supporters of HEAL Africa for many years, we know that this hospital has pioneered fistula repair in North
Kivu and Maniema provinces since 2002, when no one else was interested in caring for women with fistula. They have
four experienced surgeons trained in Addis Ababa fistula hospital, and have performed over 1600 fistula surgeries. HEAL
Africa has a wide network of community based workers to identify and support patients coming and returning. HEAL
Africa's surgical teams perform outreach surgery in North Kivu and Maniema provinces in local general hospitals, linked
at the same time with in-service training of local staff, and referring only the most complicated cases to Goma. These
services are recognized by reputable agencies since the United States through IRC, through UNICEF and through
Engenderhealth, has invested in HEAL Africa staff, equipment and infrastructure over the past five year. The Spanish
Embassy has supported HEAL Africa's prevention of fistula initiatives over the past four years, through their wide-
reaching Safe Motherhood program, working through local associations of mothers-to-be for maternity insurance and
access to safe deliveries.




HEAL Africa has a clearly defined place within the government medical system of North Kivu where they are recognized
as the tertiary referral hospital of the province. Thus they are a recognized clinical training centre of the Medical Faculty
of the University of Goma, offering the first two years of accredited clinical specialization in Pediatrics, Obstetrics and
Gynecology, Family Medicine, Surgery and Orthopedics.




HEAL Africa is a Congolese not for profit association which has completely rebuilt itself after total destruction by the
volcano, with assistance from many friends in USA and around the world. They have a state of the art surgical suite, but
the buildings hastily erected in the aftermath of the volcano are inappropriate for the quality of care they wish to offer
to patients: they deserve better.




We wish to request that the State Department give assistance to HEAL Africa to increase the quality of their services and
training capacity through the newly announced package of financial aid. We would like to ask you to fund the
construction of the three storey building which is the final stage of reconstruction of the hospital after the catastrophe
of the volcano in January 2002. The second floor of this building will be entirely devoted to women's fistula services;


                                                    50

      UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05763788 Date: 07/31/2015




and the whole hospital is devoted to teaching and preparing Congolese doctors to give excellent service in the most
underserved areas of Congo.




Many visitors from the US Embassy in Kinshasa, from USAID in Washington and Nairobi, the Secretary General of the
United Nations Mr Ban Ki Moon, Ms Rice from the Security Council, US senators and deputies, and a great number of
aides from your government have visited HEAL Africa and have come away enchanted by a hospital of excellence run
entirely by Congolese staff of the highest caliber. They are hoping that, through your visit, you will be able to advocate
for the physical plant that will enable them to serve their patients even better than before, and train the next generation
of doctors in an environment where it is possible to practice excellent medicine.




We remain, respectfully,

Yours sincerely,
