Great! Will revert with time (likely 12:30pm) and location (a private room in a DC restaurant). Hope you get a little
downtime! We'll make sure you laugh plenty at lunch. L

Lisa---


 I just landed from Cairo and would love to come to lunch and, as of now, I will be in DC. So just let me know time and
place!


 I'm copying Lona so she can connect w you since I leave again on Sat for two weeks. This travel gig is never ending--
can't wait for Thanksgiving for a few days off.
 Hope you're well, my friend.
