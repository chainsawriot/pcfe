Madame Secretary,
Thank you for the meeting today. I think I am in sync with your own thinking and would do a tremendous job for you. I understand,
nonetheless, that I may not get this opportunity to support people to have a better life and to advance our own security and prosperity.
Whatever happens, you have my support and counsel whenever it is helpful, in or out of government.
