Subject:                         Statement on settlement moratorium



Per the plan, a statement is being released in your name. This is the same statement you saw in the memo package
from Mitchell:

Today's announcement by the Government of Israel helps move forward toward resolving the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict. We believe that through good-faith negotiations the parties can mutually agree on an outcome which ends the
conflict and reconciles the Palestinian goal of an independent and viable state based on the 1967 lines, with agreed
swaps, and the Israeli goal of a Jewish state with secure and recognized borders that reflect subsequent developments
and meet Israeli security requirements. Let me say to all the people of the region and world: our commitment to
achieving a solution with two states living side by side in peace and security is unwavering.
