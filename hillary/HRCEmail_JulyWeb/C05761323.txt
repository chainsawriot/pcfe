     Finally, I'd love to meet with you at your earliest convenience to discuss all of the above and to finalize details, and
I'm sure that Kris would want to join us. As soon as all this is finalized, we'll be prepared to meet with the Secretary to
receive her "marching orders" on the priorities she would like us.to pursue. We're looking forward to getting started on
this new and exciting journey!

All the best,
Elizabeth
