Alumni

Washington, DC

HBCU Connect's ranking of best employers is based on the following criteria: HBCU student and alumni recruitment, brand
penetration in HBCU communities, relationship with HBCU organizations, consistency in outreach efforts, types of positions
made available, and messaging used to reach audience.
