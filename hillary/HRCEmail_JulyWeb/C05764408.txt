There's one detail I left out b/c it's referenced in the POGO letter but not in the information I received -- March
2009 continued "grave concerns" about AGNA. Will check on that in the AM.

Background

DOS competitively awarded Armor Group, North America, Inc. (AGNA) a contract to provide static protection
for Embassy Kabul in March 2007. An Office of Acquisition Management (AQM) Contracting Officer (CO)
and two DS Contracting Officer Representatives (CORs) assigned in Washington have overall contract
oversight responsibility and participate in weekly meetings between the DS program office and AGNA
management. Two Assistant Regional Security Officers are designated as the COR and Assistant COR.
Allegations of misconduct and inappropriate actions by AGNA first raised in June 2007, with multiple notices
of deficiency filed through September 2008. In May 2009, DOS determined that AGNA had adequately
addressed the deficiencies and was contract compliant. DOS exercised the next option year of AGNA's
contract on July 1, 2009.
In May 2009, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Contracting Oversight
(Senators McCaskill and Collins submitted requests for information on the allegations of misconduct in 2007
and 2008. Hearings were held on June 10, 2009.
On September 1, 2009, photos were released of questionable activity at Camp Sullivan, the residence for
AGNA's guards in Kabul, and the Project on Government Oversight (POGO) sent a letter the Secretary
encouraging investigation into the allegations of misconduct in 2008 and 2009.

Current State

Status of investigations:

    •  As of September 3, the RSO investigative team in Kabul has conducted more than 30 interviews of
      personnel who may have firsthand knowledge of the incident(s). Information obtained from the
      interviews points to contractual deficiencies, with no indications of criminal activity, waste, fraud or
      abuse.
    • A team of investigators from the Office of Inspector General (OIG) arrived in Kabul on September 3 to
      pursue their investigation into possible criminal violations.
    • A senior DS team will arrive next week, including an additional OIG investigator.

Actions to date:

   •  AGNA relieved from duty the personnel involved in the photographs. They will be terminated as soon
     as RSO interviews are completed.
   • The entire AGNA management team in Kabul will be removed from the contract as soon as
     replacements are identified. The replacement of the management team will be phased so as to not
     jeopardize the security of the embassy. In the interim, an A/RSO is assigned full-time to Camp Sullivan
     to monitor all contractor activities.



Chronology of Events

May 2004        M       The military ceased providing static protection for Embassy Kabul, creating a need for
                       contracted security services. DOS first contracted with PAE, Louis Berger, as an interim
                       measure ahead of full and open competition.

July 2005        M      Contract awarded to MVM. MVM began the transition, but was unable to begin
                       contract performance and was terminated. The PAE Louise Berger contract remained in
                       place during this time.

April 2006 M           DOS issued a new contract solicitation.

2007
March 12        M      DOS competitively awarded Armor Group, North America, Inc. (AGNA). An Office of
                       Acquisition Management (AQM) Contracting Officer (CO) and two DS Contracting
                       Officer Representatives (CORs) assigned in Washington have overall contract oversight

June            M       DOS received information that indicated misconduct and inappropriate actions by
                       AGNA to include failure to staff positions, provide uniforms, vehicles and other
                       contractor provided equipment.

June 26         M       Meeting held with AGNA to convey the Department's concern and request that issued be
                       addressed immediately. Responses received from AGNA on June 27 and July 16.

July 19          M      DOS CO issued a Cure Notice to address several contractor weaknesses and
                       deficiencies, including a failure to provide sufficient staffing and equipment. Over the
                       course of the contract, other deficiencies were identified and addressed with the
                       contractor, including failure to maintain a current ITAR license, failure to provide
                       sufficient language-qualified guards, and continued staffing and equipment shortages.

2008

April 30        M      DOS CO issued a final deficiency letter to AGNA, putting the contractor on notice for
                       recurring and new deficiencies identified by the COR. AGNA was informed that the
                       DOS was evaluating whether or not to exercise the option to extend the contract in 2009,
                       dependent upon the contractor's ability to fully demonstrate that it could permanently
                       resolve the deficiencies. The letter requested a final corrective action plan that entailed a
                       measurable, attainable milestone schedule to enable DOS to monitor progress weekly.

Sept 21         M      DOS CO issued a Show Cause notice to AGNA, necessitated by repeated staffing
                       shortages. Show Cause notice was evaluated by DS, Legal and AQM, with final
                       determination that all pending deficiencies were correctable and progress was being made
                       by the contractor. Progress toward addressing the identified deficiencies was closely
                       monitored by the CO, DS and RSO-Kabul.
