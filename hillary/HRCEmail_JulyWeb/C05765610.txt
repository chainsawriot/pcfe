PESHAWAR (AP) - A police officer said a bomb near a crowded market in northwest Pakistan has killed at least five
people. The bombing is the third attack in as many days in or close to Peshawar, the capital of Pakistan's North West
Frontier Province. Police officer Maazullah Khan said Tuesday's bombing in Charsada city also wounded at least 20
people. The city is some 25 miles north of Peshawar. Local TV footage showed a destroyed car and several badly
damaged stalls and shops. Ambulances ferried the dead and injured to the hospital along roads littered with debris.
