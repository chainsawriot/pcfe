Subject: Paris

Closed the loop with French. We will not do Afpak meeting on Nov. 8. Our agreed reason is that with
elections now scheduled for Nov. 7, timing is not right. We can discuss Afpak with all the allies at the
December 3 NATO ministerial.

Separate issue is whether to stop in Paris Nov. 8 for quick bilat. I said we remained open to that but that might
be better to just put it off until we can do a "proper" Paris visit. Kouchner is in Beirut for the weekend but will
get back to us soonest.
