Had lengthy talk w Z. Could not turn him around on his desire to pull out from Accord despite a lengthy effort. He
believes M not negotiating in good faith. Says he has direct channel to M and the word back is that M not willing to
implement Accord. Z claims his prestige and that of US and OAS are on the line if there is no dignified way out. He said
he was most appreciative of strong support from the US. He said he planned to call Lagos and Solis and explain his
reasons on the matter.

Z said he would keep the door open if M was willing to offer a creative and serious way out. He asked that I discuss w
Corrales, Reina and the OAS.

We just discussed various ways to manage this situation. Suggest conference call. Hugo
