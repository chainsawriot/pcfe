FYI in case there is anything you want me to addressâ€” Alec and I meet weekly and have been driving toward a plan for
how he will deploy his time and resources. This is his first pass on which we are meeting to discuss tomorrow.

Cheryl:

In anticipation of our meeting tomorrow, below and attached are a timeline and deliverables as we discussed last week.




I am having a lot of fun. I'm working my tail off, which I enjoy. If demand is an indicator of performance, I think I'm
getting off to a strong start. I'm wound up about my concept of 21st century statecraft (and loved hearing those words
come out of HRC's mouth at NYU) and am wound up about the possibilities of government to people and people to
government communication as a way of revolutionizing statecraft and empowering people across the globe. I think this
can be a major part of HRC's legacy.




Anyway ... here's the requested content for your review:
