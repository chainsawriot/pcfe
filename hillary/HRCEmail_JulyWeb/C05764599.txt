Great speech. As always, your riffs were as good or better than the text. I took them down, and we'll build on the human
security-national security-international security into the development speech. You also just made history by defining
corruption as a national security issue. My team will have an outline of a full anti-corruption strategy in afghanistan,
building on Sarah Chayes' and others' ideas, to u by early next week. AM
