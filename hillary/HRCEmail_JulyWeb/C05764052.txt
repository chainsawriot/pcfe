Huma, Joe, Jake,
On Friday morning the UN HRC adopted the Freedom of Expression resolution by consensus.

The U.S.-Egyptian joint resolution is another step on the long road to bridging divides at the HRC. It is an example of U.S.
diplomacy, working with others in a multilaterral setting following the Cairo speech and reinforces the Administration's
decision to join the HRC.
Esther
