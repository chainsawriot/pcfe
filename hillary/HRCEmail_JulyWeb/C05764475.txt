Subject: Qaddafi at UNGA - Congressman Rothman and Senator Lautenberg Objections

Jim, Cheryl and Bill:

We have a Congressional issue that is moving a bit too slowly through the building that you should know
about. Rep. Steve Rothman (D-NJ) and Senator Lautenberg have contacted us alarmed by the news that
Qaddafi will come to UNGA and allegedly overnight at the residence of the Libyan PermRep in
Englewood.. Rothman has called our office directly and threatened holy war and Fox news "if the State
Department allows this." A few minutes ago we also got a letter from Sen. Lautenberg to the Secretary
expressing similar concerns. The anger is of course over the "hero's welcome" for Megrahi. An action memo
for Jim to consider on how to deal with Qaddafi's visit is in the works, but I fear Rothman will head for the
microphones before Jim gets the memo.
