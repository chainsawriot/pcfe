I'm writing in the hope that when you're in Afghanistan you will be able to demonstrate in some public way your support
for the Afghan women. There is much disillusionment over the aftermath of the elections and the ongoing violence. It
would be a wonderful signal to the women that we do value the role that they are and must continue to play to move
Afghanistan forward.

Secondly, it would also be helpful because there is growing concern at home that the women are going to be abandoned.
I have to meet with Sen. Casey tom'w, for example. He believes that the women are critical to stability and peace in
Afghanistan and wants to discuss our commitment.

Lastly, as Pres, Karzai is beginning to plan his cabinet, perhaps you could mention to him the need to bring in some of the
talented and experienced women into his government. At our Shura meeting yesterday, we discussed upcoming
ministerial positions. We, of course, have no guarantee that Karzai will listen, but his government would be a lot better if
he tapped women and so many are highly qualified.

Thanks.
