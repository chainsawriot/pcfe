I would be careful with the commercial farming. Many African leaders support it because it's good for their cronies.
Paul Collier has been one of the most vocal supporters of commercial farming - mostly because of the success of Brazil.
Our USAID colleagues are much less supportive because historically it doesn't have as much benefit for the poor as
working directly with rural farmers. I think the best way to frame this issue is to say: we support small holder farmers
and that's what our programs will emphasize; but, if we see an opportunity for commercial farms to also help achieve
our goal of lifting 100 million out of hunger and poverty, then we will support it. In general, commercial farms usually
benefit those who are above the poverty line - not those below it. Best, Matt

Am just getting ready to go throufh emails sent after 3pm yesterday.

A few thoughts b/f I do:

1. S made commitments re angola and agriculture;

2. S agreed w/ nigerian agri min that we need to invest in commercial farming rather than only rural farming (several
countries have observed that focusing on rural farming has not worked but have offered no analysis for that but it was
said in several counties).
