Tom was honored and overwhelmed and accepted.

He said you have made him very happy and he will not let you down.




He speaks Portuguese and served there                                      so it also has personal meaning to him.

He indicated Lula would likely be very pleased by the pick as they enjoy a good relationship and have for years.
