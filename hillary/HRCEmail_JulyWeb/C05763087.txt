Hi Cheryl!

Thank you, thank you, thank you for everything you've done the last few months. I'm very excited to finally begin this
new adventure with the Secretary and really wanted to thank you for all you did to make this possible. I look forward to
working with you on Haiti and a host of other issues within the Bureau for Latin America and the Caribbean. My number
at USAID will be              and I will send along my new e-mail as soon as its assigned.

Thanks again for everything!
Mildred
