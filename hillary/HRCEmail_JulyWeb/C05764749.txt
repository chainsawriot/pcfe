Libyan Reps tell Rothman Quaddafi not coming to Englewood

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Friday, August 28, 2009 4:04 pm EST

Contact: Bob Decheine (202) 550-7869

Washington, D.C. based representatives of the Libyan government have informed
Congressman Steve Rothman (D-NJ) that Col. Moammar Quaddafi, will not be staying
in Englewood, New Jersey if he comes to the United States for the meeting of the
United Nations General Assembly next month. This information has not yet been
confirmed by the White House or the State Department.

"I am very pleased that Moammar Quaddafi will apparently not be coming to
Englewood. His appearance would have presented unnecessary safety and security
issues for the residents of Englewood and the Libyan diplomats," said Rothman. I
want to thank President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and
the literally dozens of their appointees I have had the pleasure to work so
closely with over the past seven days in achieving this result. I also want to
thank the Libyan government for their hard work and consideration in resolving
this matter in such a positive fashion."

Colleagues

On the assumption that the Department is ready to take the position that we will not permit him to use the NJ
property, recommend the following after consultations with the lawyers and experts who handle our
"hostship" responsibilities


                The Department of State has consulted with the Government of Libya regarding the
                impending visit of Libyan President Muammar Qadhafi to

                attend the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York.

    In keeping with prior arrangements, the Englewood, New Jersey property is not available for any use in
connection with the upcoming visit

I don't think that we want/need to get into particulars about boroughs within NYC

Regards


Pat


p.s. am not sure he is "President", I think [but am not sure] that is isn't just called "Colonel"

Importance: High

Team — we really need something to go out today regarding Qadahfi's visit to the UNGA. There is a rally in NJ
planned for Sunday morning — that rally is growing in scope and impact as the time passes. The Congressional
interest and concern is also growing stronger. I would propose a statement from PJ, along the lines of the one
below, but am open to other ideas. Issuing something next week will not help us all that much.
