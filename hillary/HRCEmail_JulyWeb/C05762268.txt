Subject: Early Draft: International Energy Coordinator

Jake/Jim/Bill:




Attached and below is a draft of the international energy coordinator position. I have been speaking with David
Goldwyn regarding this position, which the Secretary has offered and he has accepted. We now are in the devil in the
details position description both to encompass the scope and authority of the role to accomplish key objectives in
international energy security but also to fulfill the mission outlined by the legislation that the Secretary embraced in
QFRs from Senator Lugar (who created this position and has been unhappy about it's double-hatting in the past rather
than a dedicated staffing).




Please review and advise of any suggested edits or revisions. My goal is to seek to get this to David in the early
afternoon. This is. as you will see. a bit of a high wire act as•I

I am confident I did not capture all those goals — welcome your wisdom and guidance at your earliest convenience — in
text edits in caps most appreciated (preferred over general comments). We are pushing so that by the Secretary's
hearing on Weds, we can respond yes should he inquire if this position is in process.




thanks.
