FYI, I have been informed by Eric Schmitt of the New York Times that the story regarding possible end use agreement
violations will run in tomorrow's paper. Based on a number of interactions over the past 48 hours, it will focus on the
array of Pakistan's efforts, including possible reconfiguration of US-provided systems without prior authorization, to
develop land-attack offensive missile options. The story will mention US-provided and indigenous Pakistani systems. In
response, we have highlighted the fact that we take this seriously; we took aggressive action when we became aware of
developments; we proactively engaged Pakistan at the highest levels; we kept Congress fully informed; and that Pakistan
has responded to our concerns and that there will be mutually-agreed inspections to address our concerns.
