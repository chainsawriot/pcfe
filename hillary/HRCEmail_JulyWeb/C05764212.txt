Cheryl,

I just spoke with Vidal Jorgensen. They expect to be on the ground in about 8 months. They have not yet raised enough
money to get the project startedâ€”the total needed is $6M and they need $2M to get started. Vidal said they process
has been delayed because their work in Colombia and China is consuming all their resources at the moment. Once on
the ground, they will target the poorest of the poor and go to the toughest areas of Haiti. They anticipate an average
loan size of $200 and they expect to reach about 10,000 borrowers in five years. They expect to be profitable in 4-5
years.
