Cheryl—

In anticipation of our conversation later today, here are some thoughts in support of an appointment at State:

    •    I've been cleared by State Dept security for an ambassadorial-level position
    •    My resume (attached) shows good experience in numerous areas useful at State—and I'm known for being able
         to get the job done
    •    I'm ready to go---right now; I can begin immediately to contribute
    •    No one can question my loyalty—I've had a lot of years of successfully making high ranking government officials
         look good

Later,
