Maggie:

will call you.

Political - Philippe is supposed to be preparing a end of year document - both accomplishments and how to get
it in the narrative before mid-Dec when retrospectives start in earnest.

Foreign Policy - we have a tenative list from Michael Fuchs i will email to you - it still needs work. We did not
discuss 21st century and beyond so that frame still needs to be established

Look forward to bureaucracy movement follow-up discussion - also need to download on related challenges
that should be in the mix as we think about how to leverage the building for her needs and keep the building and
her connected, even as she travels.

I read Send - can bring my copy for HRC if she needs one.
