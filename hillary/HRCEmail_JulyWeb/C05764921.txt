Problem is, we need to get the statement out tomorrow (Aug 31), so that "six weeks" falls on Oct 12 â€” before
the soccer match. Even in best of worlds this will require further haggling with other side over next 24 hours,
so I fear if she doesn't call til afternoon on 31st (Turkey/Armenia time) we won't get it done.
If she really can't do it today would suggest Jim do so (could blame Kennedy funeral) because we need to try
this today.

Subject: Turkey-Armenia text for Davutoglu call

Huma:
For the Davutoglu call, here is a copy of the text the Turks (Davutoglu) have agreed to release tomorrow, if the
Armenians agree. And as noted in the call sheet, they will only agree if Turkey agrees on a date in advance of
Oct. 14 for the signature of the documents. Let me know if any questions.
Phil
