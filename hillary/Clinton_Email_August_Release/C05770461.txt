 Subject: Latest Version of Draft S. Testimony for START Hearing

 Attached is the very latest version of the testimony for Tuesday's hearing, which tries to incorporate (and de-conflict)
 everyone's terrific edits and suggestions consistent with our need to keep this tight and accessible. Especially as there's
 some new language contained herein, I wanted to shoot this around one last time before we send it to S. If anyone has
 any serious reaction to anything contained herein, please flag by 3:00 pm today. The speechwriters are also going to
 review, especially in an attempt to streamline. (The current draft stands at 1583 words.) Finally, I'll give it one more
 read-through before we send it along.

 Thanks again for everyone's great work on this!

 Dave

 Subject: Draft S. Testimony for START Hearing

 S., D/S, P, T, VCI, EUR, and SIP colleagues,

 Attached is a draft of S. 's testimony for next Tuesday's SFRC hearing on the New START Treaty. Please let us
 know if you have any proposed edits and suggestions as soon as possible, and no later than 2:00 pm tomorrow
 (Friday). As you review this draft, a few reminders:

     •    The testimony should be around 5-8 minutes, and ideally on the lower end of that spectrum, so
          suggestions that are word-count-neutral (or suggestions stripping or streamlining verbiage) are much
          preferred.

   •    Unlike previous remarks, this is a public hearing and the testimony will be publicly available. I tried to
        strip out language from previous remarks accordingly, and I have one question embedded therein on one
        particular clause.

   •    While these remarks are drafted to be slightly more formal (as compared to the All Senators Brief), they
        still should be as accessible as possible, esp. given the lack of extensive substantive expertise by many
        of our SFRC Senators.

   •    Please return edits on a bureau-wide basis.

H, T, and VCI are also coordinating on a full briefing binder that we plan to deliver to S. by COB
tomorrow. We can certainly shoot that around to anyone who would like a pdf copy.

Thanks,
Dave
