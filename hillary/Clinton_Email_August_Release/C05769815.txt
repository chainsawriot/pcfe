See below from Tom. We can put together a conference call at your convenience with Arturo, Craig, Carmen, CDM, me,
and perhaps Jim.

On the Mitchell material, for reasons that elude me, the two versions of the Blair statement were done on the classified
system. Ops will get the statement and the other document to you ASAP. I've also asked them to convert the statement
so that it can be emailed to you.

Tomorrow's wapo editorial makes a pretty good case about insulza and the oas. What are your thoughts on how to
proceed?
