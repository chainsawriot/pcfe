Subject: It Never Rains

I just got called by the French Ambo.                                       has had a cerebral haemmorage and needs       B6
to be medivaced. We're working on getting           n a plane to Miami.          Was medivaced today. Army doctors tell
me they just did their 100th operation in our multi-purpose (aptly named) conference room â€” including 4
amputations. They joked: "Sorry, but you're gonna need a new carpet sir."

Let's see what tomorrow brings....
