Subject: RE: PM Bellerive on Donors' Conference, SOFA, adoptions, migrants, political dilema and more

Cheryl, Bellerive hit me up before the beginning of a donors' meeting this morning to say that it's important that the US
troops in country be covered by a bilateral agreement that defines, among other things, their immunities.
                                                                                                            He noted that
we have had SOFAs covering every military exercise in Haiti since he has been in government.

                                                                                      His critics have been on the radio
daily accusing him and Preval of selling out Haiti's sovereignty by allowing foreign troops into the country.




                  From other statements he made today,
                             David

Subject: PM Bellerive on Donors' Conference, SOFA, adoptions, migrants, political dilema and more

I was in three meetings today with Prime Minister Jean Max Bellerive and he made the following points:

Donors' Confab: The GOH would like to hold the donors' pledging conference in New York on April 15. They have
discounted their original date (March 22-23) because there is an IDB meeting in Mexico City on those same dates. There
is a technical donors' meetings in Santo Domingo on April 14, and the GOH would like the pledging session to come after
it. Bellerive said the GOH would also be open to doing the pledging session on March 31, though they prefer April 15.

Status of Forces Agreement: Bellerive asked me if we could propose to the GOH a SOFA covering US troops in Haiti.             1.4(D)
                                                                                                                              B1
                               I told him we would consult and get back to him ASAP.

Adoptions: Bellerive signed the two lists of humanitarian parole letters I brought him,                                    1.4(B)
     asking if we are close to finishing all the kids in the pipeline. In a later meeting with multiple donors Bellerive   1.4(D)
talked about the case of the ten Amcits being held for allegedly trying to take Haitian children out of the country without B1
authorization. He said that this case is in the hands of the courts and that the Executive has no influence over the
outcome, but said it is an example of the GOH's need to control the problem of child trafficking which he said has
increased exponentially since the earthquake. He said the judge has three months to decide the case. He has already
dropped the most serious charge of kidnapping, and now the charges "only carry a maximum of 15 years in prison." He
said that the judge might determine that there isn't enough evidence in the case to try the Amcits. He said that the only
power the Executive has in the case would be a presidential pardon in the event they are found guilty. He would not
speculate on whether Preval would consider a pardon if the Amcits are found guilty.

Migrants: He approved the return to Haiti of 62 Haitian migrants detained on Great Exuma and said repatriations
should continue as pre-earthquake normal.

Relations with Dominican Republic: On instructions, I asked Bellerive in private what the GOH believed would be the
appropriate role of the Dominican Republic in donor coordination mechanisms.                                                1.4(B)
                                                                                                                            1.4(D)
                                                                                                                            B1




Political dilemma: The executive decree establishing a state of urgency expires on February 15 and can only be
extended by Parliament. Parliament has been fiercely critical of the Preval/Bellerive government since the disaster, and
                                                                                                  This leaves the
government with the dilemma of how to handle extraordinary disaster needs (such as declaring land of public utility)
after February 15. UN SRSG Mullet encouraged Bellerive to seek a "full consensus" with the opposition as "nothing
short of unanimity" would be required to address the enormous challenges Haiti is facing.

                                      Bellerive told the donor community that the GOH may soon have to choose between
becoming totally ineffective (which he said they will not do) or taking actions that exceed the authority given to the
Executive by the law (which he implied they are prepared to do). The government is meeting with the private sector to
get their approval of their reconstruction strategy, recognizing that they will have great difficulty getting a consensus
with the political parties. Bellerive said that the GOH is also evaluating what to do about upcoming elections and
constitutional reform, but implied that they have more time to reach a decision on these matters.

                                                                                                                           1.4(D)

Preval to address the nation: The government is going to designate February 12 (the month anniversary of the quake)
as a day of national mourning and President Preval will make his first formal address to the nation since the
disaster. They are drafting his speech to be part mourning and part the vision of the future. Preval wants to announce
that all the ministries are up and running as usual.

Ministries: The PM said that the Primature and the Ministry of Planning will be moving into the old US Embassy
building. The courts will move into the old USAID building. The plan to move a number of the ministries out to Croix des
Bouquets has met with very little enthusiasm from the main line ministries. They prefer to clear the rubble off of their
properties in downtown Port-au-Prince and either build new buildings (EU is offering to finance) or put up temporary
structures (Canada is offering to finance).
