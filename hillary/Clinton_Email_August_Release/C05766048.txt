Cheryl: Yes, the Secretary should make the call




I remain ready to participate in any meetings with any domestic or international gay rights groups to brief them on what
we are doing, and on my conversations with Museveni on this issue. I plan to meet with Cheryl Benton and others
today this afternoon to work on an outreach strategy.

Regards, Johnnie

See below.

I am looking at the article and don't know where this stands in terms of what will really happen (welcome an update) but
we should do some sort of meeting now with international gay groups to lay out what we have done.

The process will focus not only our public and quiet diplomacy (calls to pres, etc) efforts but also it will give chance for
feedback on more we should do.

I am worried this will not turn out well. We need some outreach unless I am missing what is being done in dept.

Can we do this in next several days?

Uganda to Drop Death Penalty, Life in Jail for Gays (Updatel)Last Updated: December 9, 2009 10:44 EST By Fred Ojambo
Dec. 9 (Bloomberg) -- Uganda will drop the death penalty and life imprisonment for gays in a refined version of an anti-
gay bill expected to be ready for presentation to Parliament in two weeks, James Nsaba Buturo, the minister of ethics
and integrity, said.The draft bill, which is under consideration by a parliamentary committee, will drop the two
punishments to attract the support of religious leaders who are opposed to these penalties, Buturo said today in a
phone interview from the capital, Kampala.Ugandan lawmaker David Bahati presented a private member's bill on Oct.
14 which sought the death penalty and life imprisonment for gay people in the country. The Ugandan government
supports the bill because homosexuality and lesbianism are "repugnant to the Ugandan culture," Buturo said. Still, it
favors a more refined set of punishments, he said.ln addition to formulating punishments for the gay people, the bill will
also promote counseling to help "attract errant people to acceptable sexual orientation," said Buturo.The proposed
legislation has attracted criticism from gay rights activists, both locally and internationally, who argue that the law would
promote discrimination and hatred toward the gay community.
