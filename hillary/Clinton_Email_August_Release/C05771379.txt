Yesterday Bernard Avishai, adjunct professor at Hebrew University, author of The Hebrew Republic, and a
former editor of the Harvard Business Review, argued in Taking Points Memo:

"If President Obama is looking for a way to excite us with an American vision for a Palestinian state--one that
can be started on even before core issues are (entirely) resolved, and which implies what is plausible about
peaceful integration with Israel and Jordan--he could do worse than publicly get behind the RAND
Corporation's ARC project."

Avishai acknowledges that the Arc leaves some contentious issues unresolved. "But," he challenges his readers,
"I defy you to watch this short video and think about the state the same way again."

We offer the same challenge to you. Watch the video, and see if it changes the way you think about the
possibility for a viable two-state solution. If it does, join FOTA, follow us on Facebook, spread the word to
friends, and help the video go viral!
