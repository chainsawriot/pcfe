Subject: (Reuters) Israeli air strike kills militant in Gaza Strip

GAZA (Reuters) - An Israeli air strike killed a Palestinian militant in the northern Gaza Strip when he and others
attempted to launch a rocket or mortar shell towards Israel, the Israeli army and Palestinian medics said. Palestinian
medical officials at a Gaza hospital said the dead man had been identified as a member of the Islamic Jihad militant
group. It was the first killing in an Israeli attack on militants in the Gaza Strip since September 27.
