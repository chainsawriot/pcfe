Meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu last week, President Obama could not have been more effusive. "I believe Prime
Minister Netanyahu wants peace," Obama :3411 ill. "I believe he is ready to take risks for peace."
A newly revealed tape of Netanyahu in 2001, being interviewed while he thinks the cameras are off, shows him in a
radically different light. in it, Netanyahu dismisses American foreign policy as easy to maneuver, boasts of having derailed
the Oslo accords with political trickery, and suggests that the only way to deal with the Palestinians is to "beat them up,
not once but repeatedly, beat them up so it hurts so badly, until it's unbearable" (all translations are mine).
            PI to Haaretz's Gideon Levy, the video should be "Banned for viewing by children so as not to corrupt them, and
distributed around the country and the world so that everyone will know who leads the government of Israel."
Netanyahu is speaking to a small group of terror victims in the West Bank settlement of Ofra two years after stepping
down as prime minister in 1999. He appears laid-back. After claiming that the only way to deal with the Palestinian
Authority was a large-scale attack, Netanyahu was asked by one of the participants whether or not the United States
would let such an attack come to fruition.
"I know what America is," Netanyahu replied. "America is'a thing you can move very easily, move it in the right direction.
They won't get in their way." He then called former president Bill Clinton "radically pro-Palestinian," and went on to belittle
the Oslo peace accords as vulnerable to manipulation. Since the accords state that Israel would be allowed to hang on to
pre-defined military zones in the West Bank, Netanyahu told his hosts that he could torpedo the accords by defining vast
swaths of land as just that.
"They asked me before the election if rd honor [the Oslo accords]," Netanyahu said. "I said I would, but ... I'm going to
interpret the accords in such a way that would allow me to put an end to this gallOping forward to the '67 borders. How did
we do it? Nobody said what defined military zones were. Defined military zones aresecurity zones; as far as I'm
concerned, the entire Jordan Valley is a defined military zone. Go argue."
Smiling, Netanyahu then recalled how he forced former U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to agree to let Israel
alone determine which parts of the West Bank were to be defined as military zones. "They didn't want to give me that
letter," Netanyahu said, "so I didn't give them the Hebron agreement [the agreement giving Hebron back to the
Palestinians]. I cut the cabinet meeting short and said, 'I'm not signing.' Only when the letter came, during that meeting, to
me and to Arafat, did I ratify the Hebron agreement. Why is this important? Because from that moment on, I de facto put
an end to the Oslo accords."
President Obama, and anyone else concerned about Israel's commitment to the peace process, may watch the tape
online here PI.
