Subject: (Reuters) Russia says Iran sanctions do not bar missile deal

MOSCOW â€”The Foreign Ministry said the new UN sanctions against Tehran over its nuclear program do not oblige
Moscow to scrap a controversial deal to deliver surface-to-air missiles to Iran. Ministry spokesman Andrei Nesterenko
spoke after the Interfax news agency cited a Russian arms industry source as saying Russia would freeze its unfulfilled
contract to sell S-300 missiles to Iran because of the sanctions.
