Subject:                          Ten Lessons re Middle East negotiations boiled down from Sandy and Steve Hadley's

Attachments:                      Ten Lessons for 2010_final.doc; Ten Lessons for 2010_final.pdf; Ten Lessons for 2010

We asked Dan Kurtzer and Scott Lasensky to boil down 10 key lessons from the big book of working papers that Sandy
and Steve's USIP task force has produced. They are attached. I think the most useful lessons are #3 re the process is not
an end in itself but an opportunity to put forward substantive proposals; #4 re avoiding incrementalism and developing
a regional strategy, and #7 on making sure we have a backroom operation to work through all the strategic dimensions
of possible bridging proposals.
