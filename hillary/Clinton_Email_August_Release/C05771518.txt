Subject: (AP) Iran sets February trial date for three Americans

TEHRAN (AP) - Iran set a February 6 trial date for three Americans arrested more than a year ago along the Iraqi border
and charged with spying, their lawyer said. The trial was to have started on Nov. 6, but authorities said they delayed it
because one of the Americans, who was freed on bail, had not been summoned to return to the country to appear in
court. Their lawyer said he received an official notification of the new trial date November 21. Iran warned that it will
seize the $500,000 bail posted by released hiker Sarah Shourd if she does not return for trial. Shourd has not disclosed
any plans to return to Iran. She said in an interview published Oct. 31 in The New York Times that the three stepped off
an unmarked dirt road and inadvertently crossed from Iraq only because a border guard of unknown nationality
gestured for them to approach.
