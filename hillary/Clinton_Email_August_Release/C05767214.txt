Thanks for the new years wish. You can give Senator Gillibrand my name, but I will also ask Miguel to call her Leg
Director in the morning. And I will work with Jake to track down Aga Khan's roadmap to stability.

See you tomorrow.

Subject: Happy New Year and onto 2010!

Rich---Thanks for all you did to make the past year a successful one, I hope you and your family will have a happy and
healthy new year. I'm looking forward to 2010!

Here's some questions and I'm copying Jake so he can help w the followup--

Right before I left, Kirsten Gillibrand called to discuss her cybersecurity bill. She wants to draft it so it favors State. I told
her we would connect her up w the right person who would call her to discuss in the new year. Who should that be in
your shop or elsewhere? Pis let me know so I can call and tell her.

When I was in Kabul, the Aga Khan told me he had given a "roadmap" to stability in Afghanistan and wanted me to see
it. That's all I know; can you track it down?

Not asked to go and not even going. His guys say - and he says to Tom D. I gather - that these reports are all BS.

Will call early Tuesday. We get home early afternoon tmrw.

Hey dear:

Welcome back.

What is the backstory on this â€” has Kerry been asked to go to Iran?

Subject: Iran reports: Majlis likely to reject Kerry Iran visa




After John Kerry's staff last week told us that Kerry has no plans to meet Iranian officials in Iran or abroad,
Tehran Times is reporting that the Iranian parliament will decide this week on whether to grant Kerry a visa.

"The Majlis Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to discuss the issue on Tuesday morning and then the
Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee will make a decision on Tuesday afternoon," the

English language Iranian paper cited MP Hossen Ebrahimi Sunday.

"However, [Ebrahimi] said he believes it is unlikely that the Majlis will approve the visit since it is not in the
country's interests at the present time."

Via The Hill blog, Fars news agency says Kerry's visa request has been denied.

"They could have very well taken a vote, I have not been informed of any such vote directly," Senate Foreign
Relations Committee spokesman Fred Jones told POLITICO Sunday. "Once again, I reiterate that John Kerry
has no plans to travel to Iran."

Last week, Jones told POLITICO that Iranian reports that Kerry was planning to go to Iran were not accurate.
Asked if Kerry was exploring the possibility of meeting Iranian officials elsewhere in a third country, Jones said
no. "There are no plans to meet with any Iranian officials abroad."

Over the weekend, diplomatic and Hill sources said that internal disputes have emerged over whether a
European Parliament delegation should proceed with its planned visit to Iran this month. Iran's Press TV
reported yesterday that the European MP delegation plans to come.
