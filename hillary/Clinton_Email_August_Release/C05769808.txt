I sent the news about your retirement to HRC and she suggested the letter. She was, as well she should be,
impressed with your accomplishments, Dee. And now 108 meetings without an absenceâ€”amazing.

Betsy,

Hillary's letter of congratulations upon my retirement arrived in yesterday's mail. You are SO thoughtful. Thanks for
thinking of me. I will frame it and hang it in my new home office and think of both of you when I see it. Please extend my
appreciation to Hillary when you talk to her. I'm going to share the letter with our board members tomorrow during my
last board meeting. (As an aside, I have never missed a board meeting and there have been 108 of them since the
Foundation was started in 1996!)

Love,
Dee,
