Okay, I promise not to send you all the comments on the event, but this one is particularly relevant -- S's commitment

Cindy and Damon...Will write more later, though wanted to congratulate you both on a grand slam day today. Really
impressive all-around...the video, the site, and most importantly, Secretary Clinton's remarks and commitment to
nutrition. Just what the movement needs! Hooray...Kaia

Kaia Lenhart Senior Vice President
