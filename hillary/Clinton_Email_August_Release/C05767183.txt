 U.S. Ambassador dismisses possibility that fight against crime lets up during the
 2012 elections.

 U.S. Trusts Anti Drug Fight Will Continue
 Diplomat points out that it is difficult to explain the success of the fight against
 drug trafficking with the rising death toll.

 Washington.- U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Carlos Pascual dismissed the risk that
 the current fight against drug trafficking in Mexico lets up during the 2012
 presidential election, noting there is a consensus [in Mexico] that the fight must
 continue.

 During a visit to Washington to participate in the meeting of U.S. ambassadors in
 the hemisphere, Pascual assured Mexican media that he does expect a normal
 debate about the different components of the antidrug strategy.

 "I don't see the risk that some have pointed out about the possibility that perhaps
 with the 2012 [presidential] elections the fight against drug trafficking will
 become lax," said the diplomat who presented his credentials in October.
 Pascual, former vice president of the Brookings Institution before he went to
 Mexico, highlighted his discussions with representatives of the PAN, PRI and PRD.
 "I have spoken with representatives of the three main political parties and all
 have reaffirmed that this fight against drug traffickers must continue," said the
 U.S. ambassador in the meeting with the Mexican media.

  "We will see political debates about tactics and ways to design the [antidrug]
  strategy and that is fair. Anywhere you go there must be a political debate about
  the most effective ways to lead public policy," he said referring to what is
  expected to happen in 2012.

  Asked whether he believed that drug trafficking could directly influence the
  presidential election, Pascual stated that the three parties acknowledge that such
  threat is present in the municipal level.

  "It's the same whether you talk to the PAN, the PRI, or the PRD, I think there is a
  widespread acknowledgement that what organized crime aims for is to take
  control at the municipal level to keep their 'black businesses' that will never bring
  about anything good," he said.

  According to Pascual, politicians in Mexico who propose to negotiate with drug
  traffickers are a minority, but he warned that negotiating would only lead to more
  infiltration of authorities by criminals.

 "Obviously we have heard from time to time people suggesting that the best
 thing to do is to strike a deal with [drug traffickers] and compromise. But those
 are exceptions," Pascual pointed out during the meeting that was conducted in
 Spanish.

  In June 2009, the press scooped an audio file where the then candidate and
  current mayor of San Pedro Garza Garcia Mauricio Fernandez allegedly said he
  was willing to negotiate with the Beltran Leyva cartel.

  "If we compromise we will see more infiltration and that is not a path we can
  follow," said Pascual about the possibility of negotiating.

  The U.S. envoy, born in Cuba in 1961, recognized that in Mexico, one of the
  paradoxes most difficult to explain is saying the antidrug policy is successful when
  violence is still raging.

  "One of the hardest things is explaining in Mexico how the [antidrug] policy is
  going forward and being successful when violence is increasing." Pascual
  admitted, "And it is a superficial contradiction that is hard for everyone to
  understand."

  However, the American diplomat noted that even if the Mexican government
  stopped targeting drug trafficking organizations, violence would continue because
  cartels would still fight among them, and therefore there is no other option but to
  push forward.

  With the initiative for the FY2011 budget around the corner, Pascual avoided
  commenting on the amount the U.S. will offer Mexico for antidrug support in the
