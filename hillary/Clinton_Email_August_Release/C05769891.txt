"Part of the problem is structural: The
Defense Department budget exceeds
$600 billion a year, while the State Department
receives only $50 billion. But
part of the problem is personal: In private,
Team McChrystal likes to talk shit
about many of Obama's top people on the
diplomatic side. One aide calls Jim Jones,
a retired four-star general and veteran
of the Cold War, a "clown" who remains
"stuck in 1985." Politicians like McCain
and Kerry, says another aide, "turn up,
have a meeting with Karzai, criticize him
at the airport press conference, then get
back for the Sunday talk shows. Frankly,
it's not very helpful." Only Hillary Clinton
receives good reviews from McChrystal's
inner circle. "Hillary had Stan's back during
the strategic review," says an adviser.
"She said, 'If Stan wants it, give him what
he needs.'



 "McCluystal reserves special skepticism
for Holbrooke, the official in charge
of reintegrating the Taliban. "The Boss
says he's like a wounded animal," says a
member of the general's team. "Holbrooke
keeps hearing rumors that he's going to
get fired, so that makes him dangerous.
He's a brilliant guy, but he just comes in,
pulls on a lever, whatever he can grasp
onto. But this is COIN, and you can't just
have someone yanking on shit."
At one point on his trip to Paris, Mc-
Chrystal checks his BlackBerry. "Oh,
not another e-mail from Holbrooke," he
gams. "I don't even want to open it." He
clicks on the message and reads the salutation
out loud, then stuffs the BlacicBerry
back in his pocket, not bothering to conceal
his annoyance.

"Make sure you don't get any of that
on your leg," an aide jokes, referring to
the e-mail
