Subject: (AP) US jury convicts 5 Somali men in Navy ship attack

NORFOLK (AP) - A jury in Virginia has convicted five Somali men of piracy for their attack on a U.S. Navy ship off the coast
of Africa.
   Jurors returned the guilty verdict November 24 in Norfolk after deliberating 10 hours over two days. The verdict is the
first piracy conviction in a U.S. courtroom in nearly 200 years.
   The conviction carries a mandatory life term.
   The defendants were charged with attacking the USS Nicholas on April 1 as it patrolled off the coast of Somalia.
   The men claimed they were fishermen who were kidnapped, beaten and forced into piracy.
