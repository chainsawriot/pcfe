Subject:                         Congratulating Gen Petraeus



I thought you shd know that Gen Petraeus is receiving the James Madison medal today at Princeton's alumni day as the   1
graduate alumnus who best exemplifies princeton's motto of princeton in the nation's service and the service of all    1
nations. He is enormously proud, as he shd be, to get this award. I think it would be great if you sent him an email
congratulating him. AM
