GAZA CITY (AP) — Relatives of a top Hamas security official in the Gaza Strip say he was arrested at Cairo airport while
returning from a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. Egyptian officials confirmed a member of Hamas' military wing had been
arrested before the weekend at Cairo's airport because his name was on a wanted list for using falsified travel
documents. Mohammed Dababish is a top official in Hamas' internal security unit, which oversees intelligence matters
in Gaza. Hamas officials declined comment.
