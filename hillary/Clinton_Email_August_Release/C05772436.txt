Subject: (Haaretz) Israeli Labor party expects new settlement freeze as payoff for loyalty oath

(Hareetz) Labor party ministers angered by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's snap decision to back a
controversial citizenship loyalty oath said late October 6 that they expected a new freeze in settlement
building as a payoff. Netanyahu neglected to inform his Labor coalition partners that he had approved a
right-wing minister's draft of a new oath that would require anyone taking Israeli citizenship to swear
allegiance to Israel as a "Jewish and democratic state."

The move paves the way for a vote in the Knesset and was hailed as victory by ultra-nationalist Foreign
Minister Avigdor Lieberman's Israel our Home party, Netanyahu's major coalition partner. But the prime
minister must perform a balancing act. Allies at both ends of the political spectrum and the Labor party
hope that his latest concession is a sop to right-wingers ahead of a decision to renew a ban on settlement
building in the West Bank - a key demand of the left.
