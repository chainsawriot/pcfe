Sorry -- just seeing. Ryabkov called for Ellen this morning and they are set to talk at 1030. Plan is for her to deliver same
message and go to Geneva this evening.

I assume he's avoiding the call. I hope Ellen is going anyway and that she will chase Antonov to Moscow if necessary.
What more can we do?
