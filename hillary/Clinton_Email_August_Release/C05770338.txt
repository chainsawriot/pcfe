SUKKUR (AP) - Downpours are again swelling rivers and streams in Pakistan, where some 1,500 people have died in
flooding over the past two weeks.
   Thousands are being evacuated as forecasters say more heavy rain could be on the way.
   Pakistani officials estimate as many as 13 million people have been affected by the worst flooding in the country's 63-
year history.
   Pakistan's prime minister says Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton called him to offer every possible assistance,
and NATO says it will help coordinate aid from partner nations.
