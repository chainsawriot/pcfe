FYI â€” the Senate is likely to pass the supp tonight. And, no nominees from any government agency will be confirmed
tonight or tomorrow. Would like to discuss the potential for recess appointments with you and Cheryl.

The Brookings event, especially your opening remarks, were excellent. Very thoughtful, with lots of real-life examples.
We have gotten lots of positive feedback.
