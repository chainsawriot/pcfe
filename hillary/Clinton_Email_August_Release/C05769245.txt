Cindy — please call me so you appreciate the impact of this trip on others who would be being used to do search and
rescue and transport goods and services and so that you have realistic expectations as we cannot support this in the
fashion folks ordinarily are accommodated in non-disaster areas.

Subject:           family have asked Jim to accompany them to Haiti

Dear Cheryl and Ambassador Jacobs,

             and his family have asked Jim to accompany them, the president of Lynn University (Kevin M.
Ross) and others to Haiti this weekend. They intend to go to the Hotel Montana to look at the USAR operations
and                                                                           Jim has to accept this invitation,
so he is going with them. It's our understanding that Senator Kerry has been or will be invited, as well. It's
also our understanding that Lynn University will be providing the air transport to Haiti.

Jim, first and foremost, wanted you to know this is happening. Second, he asks that whatever permissions he
and the            a.tnilv/Lynn University delegation might need to enter Haiti, for Lynn University to land their
aircraft, and for them to go to and review the Hotel Montana USAR operation be granted and expedited.

The primary contact in our office on this matter is our Chief of Staff, Chris Philbin.
Our general office phone is 202-225-6101.
Chris's cell phone # is
And I have copied him on this email so that you have his email/blackberry address


I am, of course, here to help in any way I can.

Cindy
