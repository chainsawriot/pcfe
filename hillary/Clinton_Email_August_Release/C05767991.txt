      The Secretary's Call with Ulster Unionist Party Leader Sir Reg Empey

 Background

 With the March 9 cross-community vote on devolution in the Northern Ireland
 Assembly looming, Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Sir Reg Empey and his
 party continue to withhold support for the Hillsborough Agreement. First Minister
 and Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Peter Robinson has said that Empey's
 support is an essential component of "community confidence" in the deal, and that
 a "no" vote by the UUP on March 9 would prompt him to resign as First Minister,
 forcing Assembly elections to seek a unionist mandate for devolution of policing
 and justice. Such an outcome would effectively scuttle the Hillsborough
 Agreement and severely harm both local and international confidence in Northern
 Ireland's political institutions. There is also a strong possibility that Sinn Fein
 could become the largest party in the Assembly, which could cause a stalemate in
 establishing a new Executive after elections. (Under the St. Andrew's Agreement,
 the largest party holds the position of First Minister.) While electoral
 considerations factor significantly in UTJF' and DUP behavior at present, Empey's
 position is based on: 1) his anger at a lack of consultation by DUP and Sinn Fein
 during devolution negotiations; and 2) frustration with the dysfunctional workings
 of the Executive and the UUP's exclusion from decision-making. Empey is also
 looking to leverage the spoiler role, tacitly granted him by Robinson's position, to
 force the Executive to address the ongoing impasse on educational reform as a
 precondition of his support; an outcome that could benefit him electorally.

 Since Hillsborough, Reg has received repeated calls from PMs Brown and Cowen,
 and Cameron and other senior Conservative Party officials. Empey has rebuffed
 them all and it appears their influence is limited. The Tories feel that Empey, who
 is increasingly isolated within the UUP, must be able to show his constituency that
 he has "gotten something" from the Hillsborough process, even if it is only a
 promise from the Executive to establish a framework to resolve the impasse on
 education. The Tories acknowledge that a commitment to future talks on
 education may not be enough for Empey, given his electoral concerns. Empey's
 focus on getting a concession on education puts disproportionate pressure on
 education ministerial portfolio-holder Sinn Fein. As a result, should the March 9
 vote fail, unionists will undoubtedly seek to shift blame to Sinn Fein for their
 inability to compromise on education. Sinn Fein and the DUP have met with
 Empey numerous times in recent days to discuss ways forward, although no
 agreement has yet been reached. A senior DUP official has indicated that Empey's
 requests so far are not feasible.
