REVAVA (AP) - Dozens of Jewish settlers broke ground on a new daycare center deep inside the West Bank to celebrate
the end of the government's 10-month-old construction slowdown at midnight- symbolically renewing settlement
activity that threatens to derail peace talks with the Palestinians. Some 2000 people headed to another nearby
settlement for a larger rally, where activists released 2000 blue and white balloons- the colors of the Israeli flag- into the
air at sundown. The balloons were meant to symbolize the 2000 apartments that settlers say they are ready to be built
immediately. The festivities went ahead despite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's call for the settlers to
show "restraint" as the curbs are lifted.
