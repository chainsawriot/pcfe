Cheryl. What happened this past couple of weeks has been amazing. We've been working with the Haitians and the
Hansolls, trying to put everything together for months now. Since your appearance on the scene, things have caught
amazing speed and vertigo, and having President Clinton and you chair today's ceremony has been an honour and
privilege. We still have to deliver more than promises, but the motivation you've brought into the Haitian and our own
teams is just tremendous, so I am extremely optimistic about the outcome and our capacity to do things on time.
Again, thanks!
AGUSTIN
