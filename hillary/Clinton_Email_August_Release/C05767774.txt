      The Honorable Hillary Rodham Clinton
      Secretary of State
      United States Department of State
      Washington, D .0 . 20520

      Dear Secretary Clinton:

             This is a brief note to express my sincere and deep appreciation for all the calls and
      conversations you pursued to make my judicial nomination happen. It would not have happened
      without you. I am very humbled by the friendship, loyalty, and mentorship that you have
      repeatedly extended to Ann and me. We admire and learn so much from your examples of
      political courage.

             We love reading about your work and feel so proud of all that you are doing in the
      world. And we look forward to sharing with you our birth announcement when our baby boy
      arrives in late March!


                                                  All best wishes,

                                                  Goodwin Liu

Yes but she won't see until next week when she returns — if you have it in email text — I can cut and past it to her
