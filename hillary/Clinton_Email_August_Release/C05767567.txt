Subject:                          Your technology dinner this evening



I noticed on your schedule that you are meeting with a number of tech CEO's this evening. Google should be an obvious
co-sponsor of the USA Pavilion and they have consistently pushed us off. Although they bring up IP issues as a reason
not to participate, the Chinese frequently note that they do a lot of business in China. We are now at $54 million. If the
opportunity arises, it would be helpful to note the importance of a USA standing in Shanghai.
