Subject: (AP) Germany wins Security Council seat

UNITED NATIONS (AP) â€” Germany won a seat on the U.N. Security Council in a heated three-way race. Portugal and
Canada must now battle for a second seat on the U.N.'s most powerful body for pro-Western nations. African, Asian
and Latin American seats were uncontested so South Africa, India and Colombia easily won on Tuesday's first ballot in
the 192-member General Assembly. Germany received 128 votes, one more than the two-thirds required. Portugal
received 122 and Canada 114.
