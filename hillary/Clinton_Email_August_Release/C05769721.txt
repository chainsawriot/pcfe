Britons, French, Germans, Italians, and Spaniards say the United States has done more than other countries to
assist Haiti following the devastating January earthquake. Though relief efforts in Haiti have not themselves directly
impacted opinion of the United States, the belief that the United States generally assists disaster-stricken countries
does positively affect US. image.
