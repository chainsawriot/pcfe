Raj,

In organizing efforts for Haiti you may want to reach out to Michele Pierre Louis, the former Prime Minister, who is on
the ground. I have attaached below a short email describing the situation. She is a superb executive and has one of the
best insights into what is needed.

 We are safe but Port-au-Prince is destroyed. My appartment is gone.
 FOKAL is safe fortunately but a few employees had their homes destroyed, like mine. The phones don't work so it is
 easier to stay in touch by internet.

 The situation is dramatic. the governement is powerless. The Palace, the Parliament, the Ministries, the Minustah are
 non operational. We cannot count the dead.               is dead and Minustah's headquarters collapsed. We ran out of
 medical supplies, water, food for the first reliefs, and then we have to think about reconstruction.

 As soon as we can talk I'll call you to talk about specifics.

 The hard part is that there have been over 40 repeats after the first tough seism and we don't know if it is over yet.

 We keep in touch.

 Michele
