A quick note as I head for an interview with Israeli Channel 10. Have done intensive work today with regional media,
including CNN-I, Al and AJE, about 10 in all when the evening winds down. We have had a good day in shaping the
outcome of today's activity. Coverage has been broadly supportive. The Palestinians went somewhat negative on
Andrea Mitchell's show, but I appeared as did Michael Oren and we balanced that out fairly well
                                                                                                                       B5
                      Let me know.

PJ
