0845 (Jim/Jack chaired)


Afghanistan Nine U.S. soldiers killed in helicopter crash in Zabul province in south. Taliban claimed
responsibility; investigation is proceeding. On Louis Berger case, Jack insisted we make clear in press that
we're not going to keep pouring money into any operations that are corrupt.


Iran Jim received rapturous ovation at AIPAC yesterday on Administration's Iran policy.


AIP Funding Jack and Pat commented on Secretary's concern that we ensure we maximize available reserves
as FY'10 draws to a close, to help easy tough budget choices. Pat reports he's maximized commitments to
operational funds to the maximum extent possible, and will continue to work this.


PA Funding Jim and Jack noted lagging Saudi response; Jack said he would work with Rich to find way
around ESF cap to explore an additional $50-100M in next few weeks.


Congress       DoJ throwing up last-minute objections to UK/Australia Defense Trade Treaties scheduled to be
voted out of SFRC 2:30 p.m. Andrew Shapiro working to fix with DoJ; Jim is standing by to intervene if
necessary. We have hearings scheduled for all but two nominees (Susan Johnson Cook for Religious Freedom
and George Krol for Uzbekistan). House may decide to adjourn this week. Saudi arms sale briefings going
well; AIPAC will likely not oppose if administration boosts funding for Joint Strike Fighter. Menendez still
planning to hold hearing on Megrahi 9/28; Bill Burns now reviewing State decouments we can release. NDAA
cloture vote in Senate today; seems unlikely to succeed because of continuing controversy on DADT. DeMint
appears ready to lift hold on US accession to Child Support Treaty if we issue statement that we don't intend
to support Declaration on Rights of Child.


0915 (Jim chaired)


USUN Jim was invited by UN to participate in Thursday's Ban ki-Moon meeting on Somalia aimed at boosting
support for AMISOM; is considering whether to go.


NEA Barzani/Allawi meeting finally happened; Embassy Baghdad scrambling for readout. Ban ki-Moon on
behalf of P5 may this Thursday call on Iraq to finish government formation efforts soonest.


10      IAEA meeting in Vienna proceeding; may vote on Israel nuclear capabilities resolution this Friday; our
delegation is optimistic on outcome. Human Rights Commission is in session in Geneva; follow-on Goldstone

report issued with non-controversial recommendations. Will also take up extending Sudan rapporteur and
Somalia.

SCA President will meet with Kyrgtz President Otunbayeva on Thursday in New York; Manas fuel likely on
the agenda. US Embassy office in Osh opens today with three staffers from VCRS. Otunbayeva has overcome
previous opposition to UN involvement in accountability commission for ethnic cleansing. Karimov pushing
for OSCE mission. Meanwhile, despite Rao's commitment to Bill Burns last week, Indian officials did not meet
with US nuclear industry officials in Vienna to address concerns on liability legislation.
