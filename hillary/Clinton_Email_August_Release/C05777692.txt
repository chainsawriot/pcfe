VIOLENCE IN HAITI AS MANIGAT, CELESTIN ADVANCE TO RUNOFF
(SBU) Announced results conflicted with the EU-backed National Observation Council's preliminary reports
that Michel Martelly led government-backed candidate Jude Celestin in the vote, media report. Embassy Port-
au-Prince reports civil society representatives took care in announcing early findings, but the information was
reported locally as hard fact. Post notes gunfire could be heard throughout Port-au-Prince after results were
announced late December 7.
