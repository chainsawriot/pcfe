I attended the Foreign Policy Initiative meeting this morning with Senator McCain as a speaker and he reiterated these
two stumbling blocks for New STARR 1. Modernization and 2. Missile defense. Sounded very much like talking points.




With missile defense he stated that "he was very disturbed by the signing agreement with Russia" that linked New
START with missile defense. He said he wanted to see a very strong statement that makes a clear distinction between
New START and missile defense. In terms of modernization he's taking his cues from Sen. Kyl who he thinks is making
good strides in agreements with the Administration. He said that he thinks both these issues can be resolved and the
Senate can vote on New START — he said that he thinks some Republicans are going to push that the senate only
consider and CR and the extension of the tax cuts.




He also said that he thinks it's a good idea to reduce nuclear weapons, but anyone who says that it will affect other
nation's (i.e. Iran and North Korea) nuclear ambitions are ridiculous. Someone asked if he supports President Obama's
vision of a nuclear weapons free world — he stated "I hope that we have a world without nuclear weapons one day, but I
also hope pigs fly — and I think neither will happen very soon."




He did mention that he is worried about the rise of the isolationist wing of the Republicans Party and the decline of the
internationalist wing. He stated that "he was worried about the erosion of support within the Republican Party for the
Afghanistan War."

Graham: Two START 'stumbling blocks' stand in way of his vote



By Bridget Johnson - 11/14/10 12:19 PM ET

 Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said if Jon Kyl takes care of those issues, he would vote for the arms treaty.

 Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Sunday that he didn't know if the START treaty would come up for a vote in the lame-
 duck session, but said two "stumbling blocks" had to be removed in order to get his vote.

 Appearing on ABC's "This Week," Graham said he was "very open-minded about the treaty," which needs 67 votes for
 ratification in the Senate and would face an even greater hurdle with six fewer Democrats in the new Congress.

 "You've got two impediments," Graham said. "Modernization. Not only do we need a START Treaty; we need to
 modernize our nuclear force, the weapons that are left, to make sure they continue to be a deterrent. And we need to
 make sure that we can employ -- deploy missile defense systems that are apart from START.

"So you've got two stumbling blocks," he said.

Graham said those two issues would have to be dealt with, and in its current state he would not vote for the U.S.-Russia
arms reduction treaty.

"(Sen.) Jon Kyl is working with the administration to get better modernization to make sure that missile defense is not
connected to START," he said. "If you could get those two things together, I would vote for the treaty."

On CNN's "State of the Union" Sunday, Sen. John Cornyn said that he didn't think there would even be time to address
the treaty in the lame-duck session because the continuing resolution to keep the government operating and the
extension of the Bush-era tax cuts were more pressing.

"I don't think there's a lot of time," Cornyn said when asked whether there would be time for a "Don't ask, don't tell"
vote. "And I don't think there's a lot of appetite to try to jam stuff through. The president said he wants to pass a new
START treaty in a lame duck session. I just don't see that happening."

President Obama assured Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on Sunday that the lame-duck session will be used to
ratify the START nuclear-arms treaty.

"I reiterated my commitment to getting the START treaty done during the lame-duck session," Obama said at a photo
op, calling passage of the treaty a "top priority" of his administration.

Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who served under President Clinton, said on "This Week" that it was "very
important" that the treaty be ratified.

"First of all, it's a good treaty," Albright said. "But part of the problem is we remember President Reagan said trust, but
verify. And what has happened is that the verification procedures have now not been in place for almost a year, so we
need that treaty for that."

Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry (D-Mass.) said last week that he expects START to come up for
a vote in December.
