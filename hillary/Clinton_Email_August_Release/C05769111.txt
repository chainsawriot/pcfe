Subject:                          Davut



Here's where things stand, from Jeffrey:

Called Davut when efforts to get Sinir failed (on plane prob). Davut confirmed substance of Jake S's comments to me,
said he Davut had one hour to get statement out to meet TU press cycle, and said Namik Tan would contact me asap
with proposed text. That said Davut then described substance of what he thought should be in it (he also was not clear
on whether it to be a joint statement, coordinated sep statements or just a TU statement that we'd OK and thus
support once out). However he did say he wanted to put in statement

                     We went back and forth on that and both conluded Namik and I would work out. Will get back
asap. Jim
