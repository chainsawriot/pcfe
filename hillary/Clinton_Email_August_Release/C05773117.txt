Subject: (AP) Chavez in Iran for talks on boosting oil, gas ties

TEHRAN (AP) - Venezuelan President Chavez has arrived in Tehran for talks with Iranian leaders expected to focus on
efforts to boost cooperation between the allies oil, gas and petrochemical industries.
   Iranian state television says Chavez was greeted by Industry Minister Ali Akbar Mehrabian at Tehran's Mehrabad
airport upon arrival early October 19.
   State TV says Chavez will hold talks with President Ahmadinejad, during his two-day visit.
   The Venezuelan leader backed Iran in its confrontation with the West over Tehran's disputed nuclear program. The
U.S. accuses Iran of seeking to develop an atomic bomb. Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.
