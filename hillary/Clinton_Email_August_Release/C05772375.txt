TEHRAN (AP) â€” An Iranian-American businessman freed after more than two years in Tehran's main prison visited
survivors of a deadly 2008 mosque bombing as a condition of his release in a scripted event that could carry propaganda
value at home. Iranian authorities did not immediately explain their demand for 71-year-old Reza Taghavi to pay homage
in the southern city of Shiraz and personally acknowledge an attack in which he denies having any connection. But it
would fit neatly into possible Iranian attempts to squeeze multiple messages from Taghavi's October 16 release after 29
months in custody. Taghavi, accompanied by his wife and lawyer, fulfilled his pledge to visit the site of the mosque
bombing. They later met with survivors, including people who lost relatives in the attack.

The U.S. and allies fear Iran could use its nuclear fuel labs to eventually produce weapons-grade material. Iran says it
only seeks peaceful energy-producing reactors. Taghavi's attorney, former U.S. diplomat Pierre Prosper, said he
purposely left American officials out of the negotiations to avoid having his client become a bargaining chip. "Our strategy
was to make sure that our dialogue with the [Iranian] government was between us and them," said Prosper, who held five
rounds of direct talks with Iranian envoys since Taghavi was jailed.
