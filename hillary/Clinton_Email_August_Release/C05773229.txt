DUP has gone behind closed doors at Stormont and the smart money is on them emerging at some point supporting the
deal.




There was movement today on the ancillary issue of government support for the Presbyterian Mutual Society, a savings
and loan that lost a lot of money and whose investors didn't get the same financial crisis protections as those in other
institutions. DUP members are pointing to that as enough of a carrot to change their posture on the policing and justice
deal.




Brown and Cowen are poised to go to NI tomorrow. Will keep you posted.
