     Lessons from Aceh:

     • MDFs encourage greater donor participation: Smaller donors joined
       the Aceh fund because they wished to support reconstruction efforts but
       lacked independent capacity and often did not have strong views on how
       to pursue reconstruction. They wanted the Bank to assume fiduciary
       responsibilities for the funds in a high-risk environment, and also to take
       a lead in ensuring that the funds go to prioritized activities.

     • Develop an outreach strategy: The Aceh MDF Secretariat developed an
       Outreach Strategy that includes regular radio talk shows, field visits to
       meet and discuss with beneficiaries, and communication through
       advertisements as well as a telephone hotline.

     • Engage the government in dialogue: The Aceh MDF received praise
       for engaging the GoI in policy dialogue. The MDF was an entry point for
       engaging on conditions for sustainability, relevance and impact.

     • Appointment on Envoy: The appointment of a high-profile UN Special
       Envoy (former President Clinton) increased the availability of funding

         and willingness of international agencies to try new approaches. It also
         could provide one forum for coordination among donors, if the Envoy's
         office is adequately supported.

     •    Disaster prevention: The tsunami underscored the critical role of
         disaster prevention in "building back better." It is difficult to
         overemphasize the importance of embedding risk reduction into
         recovery, especially in Haiti, where natural disasters have caused
         enormous human suffering.

     • Coordinate proliferating aid agencies: Large numbers of both public
       and private aid agencies are likely be active in Haiti for some time. It is
       important to develop effective coordinating mechanisms and work to
       ensure that agencies bring actual expertise to the country, reduce turnover
       of international staff, and seek staff with appropriate language skills.

     • Authoritative Assessment: Authoritative joint assessments involving the
       UN, the Red Cross, and national governments could have a beneficial
       impact on the decision making process and ensure broad buy-in.
