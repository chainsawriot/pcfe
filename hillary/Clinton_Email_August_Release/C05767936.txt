On democracy, Insulza repeated his line from 2005 (actually taken from Condi Rice) that it was not enough to be elected
democratically; one had to govern democratically. He reviewed his own performance applying the Inter-American
Democratic Charter (IADC) over the past five years and concluded that the record was good. He conceded that he had
intervened too late in the Honduras case but said that was because Zelaya waited until too late to extend the invitation,
asserting that he cannot intervene without an invitation from the executive branch.

"The truth is that we did everything possible to restore democracy in Honduras," he said.

Insulza said the Honduras experience showed the OAS needs to develop "swifter and more flexible procedures" to allow
it to respond more preemptively. This would include mechanisms for the OAS to "make itself present in countries where
there are possible signs of instability."

Insulza committed to "unreserved support" for the OAS human rights mechanisms, while respecting their autonomy.

"Democracy is more than elections and includes such essential components as respect for human rights, freedom of
expression, separation and independence of the branches of government, respect for the rule of law and the democratic
institutional system, and transparency and honesty in government. It also establishes a link between democracy,
development, and equity," he said.

He talked about "modern multilateralism," modeled on the EU, as his vision for the OAS. "Modern multilateralism," he
said, eschews Cold War divisions and "we all work together to build on our common principles."

On the management side, Insulza claimed he had inherited a bad financial situation at the OAS and improved it.
Nonetheless, he said, "we need more resources." He committed to seek them from non-traditional sources such as OAS
observers, NG0s, the private sector and academia. He claimed his efforts to improve transparency and accountability
had been commended by external auditors.

Insulza committed to "give fresh impetus to the gender issue at the OAS."
