We believe you should go on camera tomorrow.

We have been working the written statement overnight and will put it out shortly.

All:




See email chain below. We need to get this info into the system particularly in EUR and the Gulf region but we need to
do so carefully and as David points out with a great deal of sensitivity for the families.



                                  For example when I was in Jeddah I met with a group of prominent Islamic scholars
several of whom were leading Saudi doctors. We talked about ways they could reach out to their colleagues in Pakistan
and Afghanistan. We should get them this information and see if we can enlist them in this effort. Walter will know how
to reach them. David will advise on best way to coordinate with families.




Thx.

Vikram,




We will definitely work on continuing to highlight this brutal outrage. The Embassy, the UK Embassy, as well as IAM and
other NGOs here have been clear in their language. I know the Department will also be.
