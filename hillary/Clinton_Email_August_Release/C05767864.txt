U/S McHale — Per your earlier request, here is some information from IIP related to Haiti:



•       SPEAKER PROGRAMS: There are no U.S. Speakers in Haiti at present, and no plans to send any in the near
future.

•        WEB SITES: Working in tandem with Katie Dowd and State PA, IIP web support staff used the Content
    Management System (CMS) to update the Embassy Haiti web page (http://haiti.usembassy.gov/) with emergency
    contact information, a note on U.S. assistance efforts, links to statements from President Obama and Secretary
    Clinton, and information on ways global citizens could donate to disaster relief. IIP web editors posted the
    information on the America.gov web site (http://www.america.gov/) , with a continually updated "How You Can
    Help" list and other items on the Today's Web Picks page, and made it immediately available to our Facebook and
    Twitter networks. IIP is also reconfiguring The Americas regional page on America.gov to focus on events in Haiti
    and USG assistance efforts to that country, in English, French and Spanish, including statements made by the
    President and the Secretary, links to US assistance and relief effort sites (USAID, Coast Guard, Southcom, NGOs and
    others), a photo gallery, and articles written by America.gov writers. French and Spanish materials will also be
    posted to IIP Facebook and Twitter networks.

•       SOCIAL MEDIA: IIP posted America.gov Twitter feeds on the Haiti earthquake starting at 6:10 PM yesterday and
continued posting as USG statements became available (http://twitter.com/americagov). IIP also provided four
Facebook postings on Haiti, including statements from President Obama, Secretary Clinton, and USAID Administrator
Shah (http://www.facebook.corniejournalUSA). Similar items were also provided to subscribers of our Global
Challenges RSS feed
