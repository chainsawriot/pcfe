A draft of the year-end report is coming your way with Huma. It definitely needs your magic touch. I've done my best to
craft something readable (and useful) in the midst of all the craziness.




Derek has read and commented. Cheryl will give her comments tomorrow. I'd be happy to circulate it to others who
you would like to have weigh in.




Look forward to discussing tomorrow.
