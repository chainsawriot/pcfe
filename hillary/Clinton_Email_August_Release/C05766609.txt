Happy New Year to you as well! It's been an honor to work for you. I'm excited -- and bracing -- for the work ahead.

As for business, I've sent along the outline for the year-end POTUS report and the first weekly Af-Pak report.

Jake--I hope you and the Sullivan clan had a glorious and joyous holiday and that you're revved up for 2010! Thanks for
all you did to make this past year a successful launch. Now, the hard work starts as we try to deliver. But, it's no
hyperbole to say you are a joy to work. Onward--and upward! H
