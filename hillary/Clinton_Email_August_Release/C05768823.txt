 Re: Greek economic crisis; transatlantic consequences
 CC: Cheryl


 A potential second major phase of the economic crisis, at least in Europe, likely with
 repercussions in the US, is being triggered with the designation of Greece to junk band status, on
 the edge of default, with Portugal, Spain, and perhaps even Ireland at tipping points. This is more
 than a further unfolding of the economic crisis, threatening recovery; fissures within the
 transatlantic relationship will now be under intensifying strain. More than statements from
 Treasury should be forthcoming in the days ahead. This is about the future of the transatlantic
 relationship. Reassuring words about our enduring commitment will matter.

 I've been having conversations with John Komblum and those discussions prompted this email
 from him a couple of days ago, before the latest Greek event:

 -- the economic crisis is starting to have a negative effect on dynamics among EU
 members. Tensions over deficits, Greece etc are uncovering major gaps among the
 major players.

 -- Germany has emerged stronger than others. German voters believe (correctly) that
 they have sacrificed to maintain stability and are increasingly angry over signs of
 obvious mismanagement by Greece and others. The strains of Afghanistan are being
 felt by everyone and while the President is very popular in Europe, EU leaders miss the
 regular stroking by the US which for decades has been an essential aspect of their self-
 confidence.

 - Germany's harsh reaction to Greece has shaken everyone, perhaps the French most
 of all. They now see that Germany has been remaking the EU behind the scenes
 without their noticing it. Commonality on major issues is declining.

 -- Continuation of this trend would be very damaging to US interests. Global markets
 could be weakened significantly if the budgetary crises continue. Cooperation on issues

  such as Afghanistan and Iran could be undermined. In the worst case, the President
  could be confronted with a major crisis of confidence among members of the EU. He
  would be blamed for inattention to the negative trends.

  â€”Things are not in crisis, but the trends are worrying enough to warrant a senior effort
  to focus the dialogue, especially with the Germans and the French. Assuming the
  Conservatives win in the UK, there will be a need to guide them successfully into office.
  Others such as the Poles and the Turks cannot be ignored.

  -- In other words, we cannot treat our partnership with Europe as just another point on
  a multipolar map. Maintaining consensus within Europe and between the US and
  Europe is essential to maintaining a foundation for our global efforts.
