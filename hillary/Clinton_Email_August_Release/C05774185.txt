This new effort is very encouraging but will require boatloads of patience.

I get these reports every morning. They are somewhat painful to read since, as you know, in Pakistan, the media can be
particularly outrageous. However, we can't ignore the fact that these talk shows are the most watched programming in
prime time.. The report below is fairly typical. The host sets up the discussion in fairly provocative way and the guests,
who come from across the political spectrum, respond. As you can see, the first commentator is strongly anti US.
However, what I have observed since our media offensive began last Fall is that there is usually a more moderate guest
as well, who will argue along the lines that it is only natural for the US to protect its interests and GOP should do a better
job of protecting Pakistan. Believe it or not there have even been instances where we get credit for some of the things
we do. Also on occasion where there have been particularly egregious attacks on US policy, the host will read a
statement from our Embassy in the following programming. We try to get airtime on these programs whenever
possible but it is hard. It 's a hard slog getting this right but we are making progress.

TV Talk Shows' Summary

February 18, 2010

Program: "Center Stage" Express TV (02/18)

Host: Fahad Hussain

Participants: Munawwar Hassan (Ameer Jamaat-i-Islami Pakistan); Shahid Amin (Analyst)

Topic: U.S. Agenda In The Region

Host: Pakistan has rendered countless sacrifices in the war against terrorism but it seems that the United States is not
ready to trust us. Washington's policy towards Islamabad is ambiguous. On the one hand, the U.S. has assigned Pakistan

the role of a frontline state in the war against terrorism while, on the other, it has signed nuclear deal with our worst
enemy, India. What, in your opinion, is the real U.S. agenda in our region?

Munawwar Hassan: The U.S. wants to make India the mini-superpower in this region. This American policy prompted the
Indian army chief to boast that his country can fight against China and Pakistan simultaneously. The U.S. needs our
cooperation against Iran and China. It also wants our help to occupy the resources of the Central Asian states. The
current wave of extremism in the region is the reaction of imperialistic policies of Washington. Despite our recognition
of the Taliban government in Afghanistan, Pakistan treated their ambassador in Islamabad in a very humiliating manner.
In fact, our rulers have becomes the slaves of the United States. But Pakistan will get nothing by befriending the U.S. and
helping Americans in their conspiracies against our neighbors. The history tells us that Washington's enmity is
dangerous, and its friendship is fatal.

Shahid Amin: Every country devises its policies to safeguard its national interests and same is true for the United States.
However, it is the responsibility of our governments to protect Pakistan's interests while dealing with Americans. Today,
the Taliban and Al-Qaeda constitute the biggest threat to the U.S. security. But these terrorist organizations also pose a
potential threat to the security and integrity of Pakistan. Hence, like America, their elimination is also in our own
national interest.
