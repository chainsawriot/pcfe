Subject: (AP) Mediators try to intervene in Ivory Coast chaos

ABIDJAN (AP) - International mediators tried to intervene in Ivory Coast's growing political crisis after both candidates in
the disputed election said they were now president, raising fears the country could again be divided along the lines
established during its 2002-2003 civil war. In the northern opposition stronghold of Bouake, several hundred people
marched down a main boulevard, calling for incumbent Laurent Gbagbo to stand down. Villagers wielding machetes also
created their own checkpoint in protest along one major road in the region.
