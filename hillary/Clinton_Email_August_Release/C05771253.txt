Subject: (AP) Saudi king transfers National Guard duties to son

RIYADH (AP) - The Saudi king stepped down as head of the country's National Guard and transferred the influential
position to his son, in an apparent sign that the elderly monarch is beginning to lessen his duties. The Saudi Press
Agency reported that King Abdullah has named Prince Mitab bin Abdullah as commander of the National Guard. King
Abdullah had headed the force since 1962. The 86-year-old king also handed over his traditional supervisory duties for
the annual hajj pilgrimage to his deputy prime minister because doctors advised him to rest after rupturing a disc in his
back. Abdullah appeared on Saudi television receiving well-wishers for the Eid al-Adha holiday.
