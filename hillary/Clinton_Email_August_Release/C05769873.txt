Dear Deputy Assistant Secretary Pally,

My colleague, Anita Henri, and I enjoyed the rich conversation we had with you and Ms. Cheryl Mills as we explored
ways that the Smithsonian National Museum of African Art can partner with the State Department in the area of cultural
diplomacy.

We look forward to working with you. And of course it is with great anticipation that we await news on the idea of the
Secretary delivering a cultural diplomacy speech at our museum.

Best regards,
Johnnetta Betsch Cole

It was wonderful to meet you both this morning. I am so pleased to know we have such a wonderful resource to draw
upon. I am going to share Anita's contact info with some people here whom I hope can use you as resources so you
should expect to hear from them.

I am also thrilled with the idea of the Secretary delivering a cultural diplomacy speech at the National Museum of
African Art! I could not think of a better place for her to deliver that important message.

In the mean time please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.
Best,

Maura Pally
Deputy Assistant Secretary
Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs
