My dear Jack

I don't think I knew what bittersweet felt like until I saw this email.

I am happy for you and for what your leadership will offer the President and the country. We are blessed for that and
for you.




Enjoy your new adventure but know your home is always here for you when you need a place of retreat.

XO
Cdm

Subject: Senate just voted to confirm

After a cloture petition was prepared there was a negotiation and Landrieu released her hold. Voice vote in the end.
More words of thanks and farewell to follow, but wanted to share the news.
