FYI: From one of the folks we hired who had been working with Pierre Louis:

                             Lessons from the Aceh and Nias Multi-Donor Trust Fund

   1. The Government of Indonesia (G01) responded to the Tsunami by issuing a series of government decrees,
         and immediately organized both overview and relief efforts to ensure a rational and coordinated
         response. The first task was to produce a Damage and Loss Assessment (DLA). The DLA was followed by
         a more detailed Master Plan for Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (MPRR). The MPRR provided in-depth
         sector plans, spatial planning, the governance and supervision arrangements of finances with
         considerable attention to how to avoid or minimize corruption. The process behind the MPRR was
         consultative, with a wide range of local stakeholders and public offices being heard. The MPRR was
         presented on 26 March, only 3 months after the Tsunami.


    2. The MPRR was to form the basis for a general three-stage strategy. The Relief phase was originally set to
         six months, but was then reduced to three: January- March 2005. The Rehabilitation phase is to run for
         about 21 months, through December 2006, and the Reconstruction phase from July 2006 through
         December 2009. The MPRR provides a well defined phasing of interventions.


    3. The objectives for the Relief efforts were humanitarian relief: rescue; food and medicine; emergency
         infrastructure and temporary shelter; and burying the dead. The Rehabilitation phase is to restore
         services to minimum level: public services; economic facilities; banking and financial institutions; trauma
         treatments; secure land rights; law and order; and temporary shelter. Finally, Reconstruction is to rebuild
         the region:    rebuilding the economy (production, trade and banking); the transportation,
         telecommunications, and social and cultural systems; improving institutional capacity; and housing.


    4. The Government set up a ministerial-level agency to manage the MPRR program from Aceh itself, the
         Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Agency for Aceh and Nias. The BRR was formally established end April
         2005 and became operational early May. The World Bank Board on 30 March 2005 formally established
         the Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDF) with a Steering Committee comprised of BRR, GOI, donors and civil
         society. Having a credible local coordinators was key to success.


    5. The EC channels nearly 93% of its funds through the MDF, while only 2.5% of USD 400 million from the
         US goes to the MDF. While payments into the fund were slow, disbursements out of it were to begin
         with even slower. By October 2005, project agreements for about USD 200 million had been signed, but
         only USD 3 million had actually been disbursed. Disbursements picked up the pace thereafter. The delay
         was caused by two principal impediments: first, donors were quick to pledge funds, but getting all the

         exact written agreements in place took time. This points to the need for donors to be flexible regarding
         formal agreements, and accept simple, generic paragraphs that can contribute to speedy resolution of
         slightly differing phrasings and concerns. Second, the processing time for project approval and
         implementation was a concern. Since the MDF was to have funded projects on-budget, they had to be
         implemented by government institutions. This crated bottlenecks.


      6. Smaller donors joined because they wished to support the reconstruction efforts in Aceh but do not have
         own capacity and often not strong views on how best to pursue this. They want the Bank to assume
         fiduciary responsibilities for the funds in a high-risk environment, and also to take a lead in ensuring that
         the funds go to prioritized activities. The MDF is thus seen a well-managed bank account with some paid-
         for administrative services. However, the all-inclusive Steering Committee made membership large and
         to some extent unwieldy, and forced it to discuss both policy and operational issues.


      7. The Multi Donor Fund Secretariat has developed an Outreach Strategy that includes regular radio talk
         shows, field visits to meet and discuss with beneficiaries and communication through advertisements as
         well as a telephone hotline.


      8. MDF received praise for engaging the Government of Indonesia (G01) in policy dialogue. The MDF is thus
         an entry point for engaging on conditions for sustainability, relevance and impact.


      9. Because the MDF does not accept strict ear marking of donor contributions — though it does allow for
         preference indications — it means that the funds are freely available for programming according to the
         criteria and priorities that the MDF agrees to. Given strong GOI participation, the MDF is seen as the
         most successful instrument for harmonization and coordination in an environment that has been
         criticized for a lack of coordination. The MDF's Mid Term Review conducted in 2008-2009 found that the
         MDF had made a positive contribution to harmonizing donor efforts and to increasing the effectiveness
         and efficiency of the reconstruction effort.


      10. The MDF did not sufficiently engage the private sector and did not have a coherent job creation strategy.
         The MDF lacked executive rights, but GOI and BRR are credited with leveraging a decisive response.

Meghann

Please see attached a few quick notes based largely on the Trust Fund's progress report and an independent evaluation
commission by the World Bank, DFID, NORAd and others.

I spoke to Kathleen. I did have to cancel a piece for Canada's main evening news at CBC, which they plan to air on
Sunday before the Montreal Summit. I understand that media appearances, especially if higher profile, can cause
sensitivities.

Best wishes
