Cheryl:

Graduation Ceremony for Academy kids is Friday, June 11th, at 630pm. At our Shaw Campus. 1851 9th Street, NW

You might want to let the Secretary know that                  is going to be the graduation speaker. My guess is she   B6
can't come, but maybe she'd want to drop him a note. If so, let me know, I'll draft something for.
