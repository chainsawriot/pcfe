Not at first. I need to talk to him one on one and I can make Jack's points and mine. So please get Jack's concerns for me
before the call.

Makes sense. We'll get it done. Presume you want Jack on.

He is going to Ft Campbell tomorrow and then heading back with the Afghan delegation straight from there. So it does
not look like there will be an opportunity to see him with Jack tomorrow.
