Got a readout from Rich. We still have work to do on the cables, which we'll do at our session with Eikenberry
tomorrow. The July 2011 date was a trouble spot too -- but there is no excuse for that and that got mostly sorted by the
end.

Everything else was good.

My sincere apologies for missing elements of prep today -- I had to deal with some personal stuff that unfortunately
interfered.

Rich and I have organized a session for tomorrow to nail things down with Karl.
