Subject: (AP) Wyclef Jean not Giving up Presidential Bid

PORT-AU-PRINCE (AP) - Hip-hop singer Wyclef Jean said he is not abandoning his presidential bid just yet and will try to
get the courts to overturn a decision disqualifying him from the race. His lawyers will file an appeal with the national
electoral dispute office. Jean said he has a document "which shows everything is correct" and that he and his aides "feel
that what is going on here has everything to do with Haitian politics." "They are trying to keep us out of the race," he
said, referring to Haiti's political establishment.
