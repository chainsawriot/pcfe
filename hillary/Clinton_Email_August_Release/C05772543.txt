To follow up - the team tried its hand at a boiled down version of the CFR speech, but in 700 words it lost the nuance
and amounted to a series of generalisms. We felt that a more specific topic would allow for a sharper message. We
selected democracy because it allows you to talk about a broad and relevant trend that cuts across global affairs; to
reprise signature themes like Internet freedom, civil society, and the democracy/development nexus; and to underscore
that this administration takes these issues seriously. This was also an element of your CFR speech and provides some
continuity in that respect as well. We were not looking to break new ground but rather to reinforce.

Here's some background: This piece is for a year-ending look-ahead issue of The Economist and we were asked to write
about America's priorities and place in the world in 2011, ten years after 9/11 and twenty years after the end of the Cold
War. The team (Jake, Josh, Anne-Marie, Derek) felt that this was a good opportunity to pull together for a wide audience
some of the key themes you sounded in Krakow and elsewhere, and build on the President's call to action at UNGA. We
don't say anything new here, its true, but the idea was to lay down another marker that these are issues that are
important to you and to the administration.

I just got the draft and don't think it says anything. What is the question we are trying to answer or issue we were asked
to address in this?
