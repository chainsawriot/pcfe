Subject: (AP) Brazil Supreme Court action delays return of 9-year-old boy to his U.S. father.

Colleagues, for your information:

The AP reports Thursday's ruling by Justice Marco Aurelio Mello is the result of a petition by the boy's Brazilian family
that he remain in Brazil until the court decides whether the boy's own testimony should be heard in the case. The ruling
suspends a Wednesday judgment by a lower court ordering that David Goldman be given custody of his son,
Sean. Because the Court goes into recess tomorrow, a ruling on whether the boy's testimony should be heard is not
likely before February. Media report the boy is expected to remain in Brazil at least until then.

Regards, H.
