You voted against raising the debt limit on the following occasions:

June 11, 2002
May 23, 2003
March 16, 2006

Additionally, on March 11, 2004, you voted for a Lautenberg amendment that would have struck a provision in the CR
raising the debt limit.

Increases to the debt limit were also debated and considered by the Senate on March 17, 2004 and September 27, 2007.
You did not cast a vote either time.
