                                                                                       RELEASE IN FULL
                                 "The Giving Pledge" At-A-Glance

   WHAT: Launched by Warren Buffett during the Summer of 2010, the Giving Pledge is an effort
   to invite the wealthiest individuals and families in America to commit to giving the majority of their
   wealth to the philanthropic causes and charitable organizations of their choice either during their
   lifetime or after their death. Each person who chooses to pledge will make this statement publicly,
   along with a letter explaining their decision to pledge. At an annual event, those who take the pledge
   will come together to share ideas and learn from each other.

   The Pledge is a moral commitment to give, not a legal contract. It does not involve pooling money
   or supporting a particular set of causes or organizations. While the Giving Pledge is specifically
   focused on billionaires, the idea takes its inspiration from efforts in the past and at present that
   encourage and recognize givers of all financial means and backgrounds. We are inspired by the
   example set by millions of Americans who give generously (and often at great personal sacrifice) to
   make the world a better place.

   WHO: The Pledge currently has forty participants, listed below in alphabetical order. To date, all
   are American, although a dinner is scheduled in Beijing for September 29, 2010, in hopes of
   generating interest for the Pledge among wealthy Chinese.
