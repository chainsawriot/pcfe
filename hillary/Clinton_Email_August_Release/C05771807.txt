  Ms. Jennifer Robinson
  Attorney for Mr. Julian Assange
  WikiLeaks
  179 Great Portland Street
  London WIW 5LS

  Dear Ms. Robinson and Mr. Assange:

  I am writing in response to your 26 November 2010 letter to U.S. Ambassador Louis B. Sussman
  regarding your intention to again publish on your WikiLeaks site reportedly up to 250,000
  classified U.S. Government documents which are not authorized for release.

  As you know, if the materials you intend to publish were provided by any government officials,
  or any intermediary without proper authorization, they were provided in violation of U.S. law
  and without regard for the grave consequences of this action. As long as WikiLeaks holds this
  material, the violation of the law is ongoing.

  It is our understanding from conversations with representatives from The New York Times, The
  Guardian and Der Speigel, that WikiLeaks also has provided approximately 250,000 documents
  to them for publication, furthering the illegal dissemination of classified documents.

  Publication of documents of this nature at a minimum would:

     •   Place at risk the lives of countless innocent individuals — from journalists to human rights
         activists and bloggers to soldiers to individuals providing information to further peace
         and security;

     •   Place at risk on-going military operations, including operations to stop terrorists,
         traffickers in human beings and illicit arms, violent criminal enterprises and other actors
         that threaten global security; and,

     •   Place at risk on-going cooperation between countries — partners, allies and common
         stakeholders — to confront common challenges from terrorism to pandemic diseases to
         nuclear proliferation that threaten global stability.

  In your letter, you say you want — consistent with your goal of "maximum disclosure" —
  information regarding individuals who may be "at significant risk of harm" because of your
  actions.

  Despite your stated desire to protect those lives, you have done the opposite and endangered the
  lives of countless individuals. You have undermined your stated objective by disseminating this
  material widely, without redaction and without regard to the security and sanctity of the lives

                                                                                             Page I 1

   your actions endanger. We will not engage in a negotiation regarding the further release or
   dissemination of illegally obtained U.S. Government classified materials. If you are genuinely
   interested in seeking to stop the damage from your actions, you should: 1) ensure WildLeaks
   ceases publishing any and all such materials; 2) ensure WildLeaks returns any and all classified
   U.S. Government material in its possession; and 3) remove and destroy all records of this
   material from WikiLeaks' databases.

                                                       Sincerely,



                                                       Harold Hongju Koh
                                                       Legal Adviser
                                                       U.S. Department of State
