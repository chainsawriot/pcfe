Just a quick note to tell you that we are moving forward on the Expo funding. ATT came in at $500k, McGraw Hill at
$200k, Intel at $250k more, Delos Living (a Mantz client) $250k, and CITI at a minimum of $2M brings us down to $3.7M.

The following are on deck and likely to come in soon - Boeing (more), Carlyle, Blackstone, Alcoa, and AECOM. EB and I
chatting with many others.
