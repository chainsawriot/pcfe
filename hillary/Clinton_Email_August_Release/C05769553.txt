Thank you for passing this on to the appropriate people.

Dear Madam Secretary:

I was in Krakow, along with our chairman, Madeleine Albright, for the 10th anniversary
celebration of the Community of Democracies. I just wanted to express our appreciation for
your inspirational speech in defense of civil society. Your remarks were warmly received by
the group assembled in Poland and sent an important signal to both friends and adversaries
worldwide about America's commitment to fundamental human and political rights. From
ND l's perspective, your words were also a message of solidarity to democratic activists who,
in their peaceful struggle, can often feel isolated and neglected.
