  Thanks so much for the chance to talk. I've relayed all your answers/suggestions to George
  Stevens, and we'll proceed thus on all points. As for the reception, it'll be upstairs at the
  Kennedy Center, starting at 4:30.
    Again, Happy New Year to you, Bill, Chelsea and Mark â€” and to your terrific team.
