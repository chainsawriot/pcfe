Mike, I write to ask a personal favor. An old friend of mine named David Ramage died earlier
this week                                       David was for many years the president of the
New World Foundation. During that period the Secretary served on the board of the foundation
and worked with David. His family would like the Secretary to be informed of David's
death. Incidentally when I worked at the NSC I walked David over to the White House for a
private meeting with the First Lady which was just the two of them. I can provide additional
details on the memorial service if she were interested but the family's concern was only that she
be informed. Mort
