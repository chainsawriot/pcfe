Subject: (Reuters) UK says bomb could have brought down a plane

LONDON (Reuters) - A bomb found on a U.S.-bound cargo plane in Britain was "viable" and could have brought down an
aircraft if it had exploded, British interior minister Theresa May said. In response, Britain will act immediately to stop
the movement of all unaccompanied air freight from Yemen into or through Britain, she told reporters.
