Mark

Thnx for the offer to help on Expo. I can send you the full list tomorrow. Would be happy to download in the am.

Dell, Intel, Microsoft (and about 20 others) all in but HP is not and Ford despite our best efforts keeps turning us down -
they are the only major global auto company not represented in Shanghai (Blanchard and Gephardt going back at them
yet again this week). Oracle, Alt, ADM, Monsanto, and financial and insurance companies among the other logical
companies not in yet.

Will call you in the am

Kris

Mark--thanks for the offer of help. I'd appreciate anything you can to do assist w the completion of the American

Wondering why no one called me since I have probably 20 clients from Ford, Microsoft, Intel, HP, Dell all very interested
in Shanghai Expo as well as 100 people in China.




Kind of late but happy to help if someone still needs anything.
