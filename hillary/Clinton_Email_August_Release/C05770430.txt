Subject:



Something has gone haywire with my blackberry (oh no!!) so I must apologize if you have already
heard from me and if not, apologize again for the delay in getting back to you with my update. Rob,
the letter arrived on time and      and I delivered it to the         family at the wake last
night,        and the kids were so touched by the letter and the effort made by all of you.        said
through tears: that wonderful woman!! And that you are, my Dear Gert. Your words meant so
much to the kids and         They were showing it, very carefully, to       s family, especially her
father. This was a hard one. Love you, B
