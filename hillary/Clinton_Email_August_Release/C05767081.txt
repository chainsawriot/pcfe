Subject: Schedule

The Lithuanian FM just told me the Community of Democracies is July 9-11 in Cracow, Poland. I have to go since I
promised the Polish FM but had hoped they would schedule July 2-4. Can you check w EUR and DRL to see if dates can
be moved? If not I can only go for the 9th since                                                    l_et's see if there is
any give. I would also go to other places first during that week in Europe, including Warsaw for a bilateral meeting.

Also, am I doing a video to congratulate Lithuania on the 20th anniversary of their Independence on March 11?
