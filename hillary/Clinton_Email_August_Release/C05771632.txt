I'm sending 2 emails today b/c I didn't send one yesterday. :-)

Attached is a one-pager fleshing out how we could launch a Pledge for Palestine based on the Warren Buffett model. If

contacts with a group of young Arab business leaders -- I spoke to them last year and cd quickly reach out to their chair.

We are getting details from Rand about the full cost of The ARC project.
