Subject: (AP) Ahmadinejad says capitalism faces defeat

UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Iran's President Ahmadinejad said capitalism is facing defeat and called for an overhaul of the
"undemocratic and unjust" global decision-making bodies. In a speech on the second day of a U.N. anti-poverty summit,
the Iranian leader called on world leaders, thinkers and global reformers "to spare no effort" to make practical plans for
a new world order. To spotlight this effort, Ahmadinejad proposed the United Nations name the current decade the
Decade for Joint Global Governance.
