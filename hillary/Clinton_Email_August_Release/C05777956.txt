Subject: (AP) Palin to visit Haiti for humanitarian effort

JUNEAU (AP) - Sarah Palin plans to visit Haiti this weekend to aid in humanitarian efforts in the Caribbean country. A
Palin staffer confirmed the former Alaska governor and 2008 vice presidential nominee would travel to Haiti with the
Rev. Franklin Graham as part of the outreach of his Samaritan's Purse relief organization. Palin staffer Rebecca Mansour
says Palin is expected to stop at a cholera clinic. She says Palin's husband, Todd, will join her and she believes daughter
Bristol will, as well.
