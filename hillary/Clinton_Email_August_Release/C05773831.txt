PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Haitian President Preval said October 22 an outbreak of cholera killed at least 138 people in
the quake-hit country's central region and his government was taking measures to try to stop the disease spreading.

  "I can confirm it is cholera," Preval told Reuters, as Haitian and international health officials confronted the poor
Caribbean nation's biggest medical crisis since the January 12 earthquake.
