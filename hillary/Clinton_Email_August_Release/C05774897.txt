Subject: Human Trafficking Effort - Hope You'll Take A Moment

HRC,
Researched a lot since Tuesday. After Rochester water security meeting Simon came to my house last evening to discuss
subject issue, etc. Heck, greater good sometimes served in such small patio fashion. Re human trafficking, his software
can apply and previously uninvolved resources / relationships available. You know all this, but we didn't: Seems 'acta
non verba' needed. Despite increased pre-victimization education & awareness growing - and not-for-profits, TVP Act of
2008, your G/TIP office helping, appears same apps as tracking terror cells, interdiction of pirating and drug trafficking,
removal of financial lure not fully brought to bear. Forgive oversimplification, but akin to cessation of 400 years of
African / transatlantic slave trade..In addition to crushing backers' / sponsors' greed ( I guess so-called 'law' of economics
)   blocking trader access, interdicting in progress, punishing / eliminating traders (sponsors & backers) would appear
to get it done. In addition to 21st century tech & resources, moral outrage should help eliminate / vastly reduce this
scourge. No doubt many good & smart people already involved, but perhaps the more the merrier. Simon ( and Dave's
former partner Jim Blom ) can bring nourishment to this table. Simon will get / remain in touch with Phil Goldberg - and
both of us with Kris. Thinking same apps could apply to Mexico. Talk about a destabilizing scourge too close for comfort !
We want to help. Great to see you & thanks again.
Marty
