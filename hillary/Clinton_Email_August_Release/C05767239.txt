It is being reported that she (Coulter) was in Haiti before with Silsby:
(From AFP: Judge Bernard Saint-vil, who is handling the case, allowed them to leave the country without bail, according to their
lawyer Aviol Fleurant. But Saint-vil wants to question two other missionaries -- group leader Laura Silsby and her confidante Charisa
Coulter -- "because they were in Haiti before the earthquake," Fleurant added.)

Media is reporting that she was Silsby's nanny and was involved in organizing the trip. Unclear at moment if they think she was down
there before with Silsby.

All-

Below is the statement for spox to release for after the flight goes wheels up. I will let you know when that happens. We anticipate
around 8:30pm. CA has reached out to HHS who will be receiving the plane and they will help keep media away from the AmCits and
facilitate entry. Once they arrive in Miami it is up to them to get to their destination.




Thanks,
Caitlin

Today, the Haitian judge released eight of the ten American citizens and they have departed Haiti for the United
States. Two members of the group are being detained in Haiti to answer further questions, as the investigation is
ongoing. The United State Government respects the sovereign right of the Government of Haiti to conduct its
own judicial processes. The United States Embassy in Port au Prince has been providing the detained
Americans with consular visits and assistance to ensure that they are safe and receiving necessary care. Haitian
authorities have been cooperative in ensuring the individuals' safety and welfare since their arrest and we have
every expectation this will continue.
