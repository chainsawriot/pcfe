As you probably heard from Bill Burns there are elements in Ukraine who keep trying to revert to the bad old days. The
SBU (who went after            have now gone after soros foundation there and there are new media freedom
challenges. I hope you'll be able to meet with Yanukovych during UNGA because it's going to take steady engagement
from keeping the worst backsliding from happening. I met w Ukr amb and Lou Debaca yesterday to establish ways we
can work with them on trafficking. Some officials have reached out to us which is good. Others are going backwards so
we want to keep the good progress they've made over the last few years going forward. The amb was grateful so we
shall see.
I'm en route to India for the Vital Voices Asia summit and for a round of mtgs on the dialogue. Will see SEWA on
eookstoves. Good luck on the Middle East.
By the way, it looks like Bachelet will lead UNWomen. I hope that's the case. SG to announce his choice before UNGA.
Will let you know as soon as we hear definitively.
