  Re: NI conference


   Shaun has been excluded from the NI conference in its entirety. I've included the exchange of
   emails below. Exactly how Shaun has been shut out remains unclear.


   Sid - my email exchange with Declan. Seems like Labour is firmly to be
   excluded!

   Declan,

  Thanks for your email. Of course it's not personal. But I do think it's
  wrong.

  When we were in Government we believed we could only succeed if we treated
  Northern Ireland as a bi-partisan issue and I encouraged other Governments
  to adopt the same approach. That meant when President Bush was in the White
  House, I went out of my way always to see and brief Democrats - in Congress
  and in the Senate - whenever I came to the States. It also meant when we
  held the first economic conference led by Mayor Bloomberg in Belfast, the
  dinner we gave at Hillsborough was not restricted to just those in
  respective Governments.

   In respect of how we handled the issue within the UK, that didn't mean I
   invited the Shadow Secretary of State to share every platform, but the
   Shadow was not excluded from being at major events. Indeed we made a point
   of not only saying we were bi-partisan, but acted accordingly.

   Having brokered the Hillsborough Agreement and having discussed with your
   Secretary of State - at all stages - how the US could help through an
   Economic Conference, I am obviously somewhat disappointed not to have been
   invited to attend the Conference in any capacity.

   That of course should never be confused with my deep respect and admiration
   for Secretary Clinton. Frankly without her help during her time in the White
   House, as a Senator, as a candidate and now as Secretary, we could never
   have made the progress we did. You will know that, at the time, I was always
   disappointed that her contribution to the peace process and political
   process was not recognized appropriately by the Conservative Party and their
   spokesmen when they were in Opposition.

   The decision by Owen Patterson to decide not to be present at next week's
   Conference is a matter for him and the political demands he has chosen on
   which to determine his priorities. You would not expect me to comment on his
   decision.

   However, I don't have to rehearse with you that successful long-term

  economic investment in Northern Ireland will require building not only a
  stable peace process, but continuing to build cross-party and
  cross-community consensus. I am sorry we have not been invited to help.

  The current coalition Government in Britain will not always be in power and
  it may not even last the course. It seems regrettable that in such a
  challenging global economic environment that those of us who helped build
  the peace are not even invited to continue helping.

  Best,

  Shaun
