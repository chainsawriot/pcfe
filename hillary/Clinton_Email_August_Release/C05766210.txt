Subject: Danish PM to become president of UN climate talks

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen will replace Danish minister Connie Hedegaard
as president of the UN climate talks for a final summit session, the United Nations said. "With so many heads of state
and government having arrived it's appropriate that the Prime Minister of Denmark presides," Hedegaard told the 193-
nation meeting. "However, the Prime Minister has appointed me as his special representative and I will thus continue to
negotiate the...outcome with my colleagues," she said. She said the move was procedural. Separately, Hedegaard has
been criticized by African nations for favoring rich nations in the negotiations.
