Subject:                             Iraq govt formation



Basic principles for NYT ed board:

US principles: gov't should reflect election results; gov't must have significant role for Iraqiyya (good for internal stability
and regional integration); gov't formation should include a strong reform and power-sharing understanding; we want a
gov't as committed to the long-term partnership with us as we are. These are principles backed by all Iraqi leaders, who
need to make decisions now to break the deadlock.

We have no candidate for PM. We have encouraged Allawi's Iraqiyya and Maliki's State of Law to see if they can work
together, because that reflects the votes and would give the new gov't a healthy majority. But who fills what position --
that's for the Iraqis to decide.

There may be other ways to have a gov't. But this should happen soon. Where we would have concerns: if the Sadrists
end up with the power to veto gov't decisions or to topple the gov't.
