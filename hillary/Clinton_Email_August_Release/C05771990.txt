Let me try this again.

Robert Pape is a top strategic thinker from U of Chicago who is best known for his empirical work showing a strong
correlation between suicide terrorism and occupation by foreign troops. In his new work he is proposing a grand strategy
of off-shore/on-shore balancing. Below is the elevator version, or at least an academic's version of the elevator version.
What is interesting is how closely it tracks with our emphasis on civilian power and the need for a smaller military due to
budget constraints. If you want more the attached one-page proposal outlines a 3-year series of steps to apply this
proposal to Afghanistan.

"An Alternative Security Strategy. Off-shore/on-shore balancing seeks to achieve America's core national security
objectives through a combination of over-the-horizon ("off-shore") military power and in-region ("on-shore") economic and
political power. Off-shore/on-shore balancing is an alternative to advancing U.S. security goals through the deployment of
large ground forces overseas, already problematic and likely to become even more so as economic challenges continue
and chronic resentment deepens. Off-shore/on-shore balancing relies on naval, air, and rapidly deployable ground forces
in combination with on-site economic and political support for local partners to secure America's interests in combating
terrorism and achieving other key national security goals, particularly in the Middle East and Asia."

Subject: Asking to Meet with You

Dear Anne-Marie,



As we discussed during your salon dinner with Steve Clemons at Nora's, I am developing a practical strategy of
"off-shore/on-shore balancing" that would involve key USG agencies.



As the attached proposal explains, the new strategy is substantially different from previous historical constructs
in the literature on American grand strategy and offers important advantages to improve our position in
Afghanistan and other regions in the world in the coming years.



Going forward, I would like make sure I have State's views correct. If you and your staff could meet with me
later next week, this would greatly help.
