Jake, Cheryl,
Mike sent this note from Israel, and we will send to S as a note for the Secretary â€” wanted to give you an
advance copy. Will share with Jeff Feltman and Mara Rudman too.
Regards, Deborah G

NOTE from Mike Posner for the Secretary
Tomorrow, Nov. 11, we are completing a four day visit to Israel. I am accompanied by Colonel (Ret.) David
Graham, the Director of the Army Jag School in Charlottesville. This trip builds on our January visit in which
we met with various Israeli officials, including the Chief of Staff of the IDF, to discuss follow-up to the
Goldstone Report.

Our approach has been to offer our support and willingness to work with the Government of Israel to reframe
the public debate from defensive (responding to Goldstone or Flotilla reports and resolutions at the UN, etc.) to
a more pro-active narrative focused on the challenges of fighting an urban or asymmetrical war. We are
having productive, and generally positive preliminary conversations about a possible GOI white paper that
would: 1) set the context, outlining the challenges in fighting an asymmetrical conflict; 2) spell out the steps the
IDF and other agencies have taken to address these challenges; and 3) identify ongoing challenges that Israel
and other professional armies will need to address in the future.

We have been clear that this must be an Israeli initiative, not ours, but that we can help promote and use the
report once it has been completed. Thus far we have met with Deputy Foreign Minister Dan Ayalon, Minister
without Portfolio Benny Begin, Justice Minister Yaakov Neeman, and Deputy PM, Dan Meridor. Meridor, in
particular is very interested and supportive of what we are exploring. Tomorrow we will meet with Gabi
Ashkenazi, the IDF Chief of Staff, and with several other senior IDF officials, including General Avichai
Mandelblit, the IDF's Judge Advocate, who has led the the government's investigation of the Goldstone/Cast
Lead cases.

At this juncture we do not expect or need you to raise any of this with the PM or other Israeli officials. I simply
wanted you to know what we are doing, and the status of these efforts, in case anyone in the Israeli delegation
raises this with you.

End note

Deborah Graze
Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary
Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor
