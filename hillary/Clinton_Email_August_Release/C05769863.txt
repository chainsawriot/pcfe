Dear Madam Secretary:

I greatly appreciate your support of our efforts to improve USG outreach to the European Parliament (EP) and
wanted to provide you with a brief update on our progress. We have worked very hard at USEU to deepen and
intensify our relationship with the EP over the past several months. Specifically, we have,

      (1) Increased the flow of high-level USG visitors to the EP. Recent visitors include Janet Napolitano, Dick
          Holbrooke, George Mitchell, Dick Morningstar and Ron Kirk. These visits culminated last month in a
          highly successful address by VP Biden to a Plenary Session of the EP. I hope that you will also address
          a Plenary Session of the EP in the near term. (Your town hall meeting at the EP with young leaders last
          year was well-received here.)

      (2) Increased the flow and quality of EP interactions in Washington. We have facilitated a dramatic
          increase in the number of EP delegations visiting Washington and a significant improvement in the level
          of their access to high-level USG officials.

      (3) Increased USEU outreach to the EP at every level. At the Mission, we are restructuring the way in
         which we interact with EP leaders by institutionalizing responsibility for key relationships and
          enhancing accountability. In the coming months, we expect to receive two additional FTEs at the
         Mission to improve our ability to cover the EP. We have also encouraged our Embassies in member
          State capitals to meet with European Parliament members.




Again, thank you for your interest and support for our efforts.

Bill Kennard
