Cheryl, Judith and Pi,

Wanted to give you a brief update on the initial results of the redesign. Please let me know if you have questions about
the attached and below memo. I hope this can highlight for you the positive direction we are headed in, the increase in
audiences we are engaging and more importantly, that this is only a continuation of the positive reaction we are having
to our digital engagement efforts. Best, Katie

Re: Redesign of State.gov Accomplishments and Changes

On Thursday, December 17, 2009 the Department launched a new homepage design and altered navigation
functionality for www.state.gov, the public facing site of the State Department.

The site aimed to meet the following goals:

      •     Better highlight the Department's priorities

      •     Proactively engage visitors

      •     Develop more Search-friendly features

      •     Provide easy access to vital citizen services, e.g. passport and visa information

The launch brought a series of positive press as noted in the below clips:

"..it embraces social networking and other Web 2.0 tools in an exercise it called "21st Century statecraft." — AFP
Global

"Gone are the old pro forma website verticals like press information, career postings, and resources for kids and other
young one. Now, State.gov's site navigation draws attention to the ambitious policy thrusts that Secretary Clinton
would like to make the centerpieces of her tenure at the department." — TechPresident

"The State Department hopes to use the site to engage people in an ongoing dialogue on foreign policy" -- Federal
Computer Week

"The U.S. Department of State today unveiled a redesign of its official website, incorporating improved functionality
and an updated design. With significant increases in traffic and expanding needs among users, the new, simplified
design of www.state.gov aims to: present the Department of State more transparently, effectively communicate the

            overarching mission of the Department of State, and increasingly engage audiences in an ongoing dialogue with
            Secretary Clinton and others in the Department on the foreign policy issues facing the country." — Enews Channel

            Results:
            Overall the site has received positive praise from inside and outside the building on the new simplified design. The
            increased focus on major foreign policy objectives and on social networking have altered traffic and increased our
            networks. The new design allows us to better educate visiting audiences on the priorities of the Department and better
            engage in a daily conversation.

            All metrics are trending up for visiting audiences to state.gov, Dipnote the blog, and social networking.

            Top Line Statistics:

            State.gov: 37% increase in traffic

            Dipnote Blog: 30% increase to traffic

            Facebook: 20% increase to number of fans

            Twitter: 23% increase to number of followers

            Search: -3% indicating that users perhaps are better at finding information and have less of a need for search function.
            We will continue to monitor.

            Going forward:

            We will continue to monitor all our metrics to ensure we are expanding our reach and engagement. We will look in the
            coming year to continue refining the website to build upon initial successes to ensure information is easy to find,
            understandable and useable. We will also look to build more language support into State.gov, and increase the number
            of social networking tools we are using to engage visiting audiences.

            Also given the increased importance on interagency priorities like Global Health and Food Security, we will seek ways
            that we can work together across agencies to promote our agenda and educate each of our visiting audiences on
            priorities through www.state.gov.
