Monica--I hope you had a wonderful holiday season and thank you for all of your help this past year. You've been a life
saver. I'm looking forward to 2010 being even better.

Here are a few things as we start the year--

I'd like to work w you to prepare a menu for Jason. Also does he give me a monthly bill for the food he buys and
prepares for me?
Could you or he buy skim milk for me to have for my tea? Also, pls remind me to bring more tea cups from home.

Also, pls try to get me a copy of the Human Rights Watch report titled "We Have the Promises of the World: Women's
Rights in Afghanistan."

Can you give me times for two TV shows: Parks and Recreation and The Good Wife?
