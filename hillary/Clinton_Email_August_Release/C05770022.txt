Re: Kyrgyzstan crisis, report and recommendations


Scott Horton has just returned from a week in Kyrgyzstan, where he held lengthy private conversations with a
range of leaders. He has sent me his confidential report. In light of the crisis there—the pogroms that have
created perhaps as many as 450,000 refugees, according to the U.N.—and on the eve of the June 27

other U.S. initiatives. His policy recommendations follow his report.

element. Several candidly acknowledged that the government's grip on the south, particularly Osh and
Djalalabad provinces, was extremely tenuous. They said they had severe "loyalty" problems with key figures in
the police and military. When I pressed on what they meant by "loyalty," I was told that the Bakiyev family
had "its people" in key positions in the police and army and that they had intercepted communications between
