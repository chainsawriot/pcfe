Ur email must be back up!!
What happened is judith sent.you an email. It bounced back. She called the email help desk at state (I guess assuming u
had state email) and told them that. They had no idea it was YOU, just some random address so they emailed. Sorry
about that. But regardless, means ur email must be back! R u getting other messages?

Good Afternoon,




I work as a Help Desk Analyst and it has come to my attention that one of our customers has been receiving permanent
fatal errors from this address, can you please confirm if you receive this message.



Thank you for your assistance,




Christopher
