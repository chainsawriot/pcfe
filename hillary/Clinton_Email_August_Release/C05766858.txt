Madame Secretary:

Per our earlier conversation and within the boundaries of unclassified email, there are three objectives we can achieve
regarding the country we
discussed:

1) Enable broad communication between resistance organizers and participants without significantly increasing risk for
individuals;

2) Circumventing government-imposed firewalls that expediently enable individuals to transmit text, image and video
documentation of what is happening on the ground; and

3) Identify and make viral symbolic content that will move global opinion.

All of my and Jared's ideas which you saw reflected in the memo from last week are executable from anywhere between
24 hours to a couple months.
There are not any technological barriers to execution, but as I discussed with Jake, some take us well past the
boundaries of what has been allowable to date in our current policy framework.
That said, we are ready and willing to take action as soon we have a "go" order. I am happy to review specific content
from the memo with you or others offline.

Separately, I wanted to share some key activities following up on your Internet Freedom speech, which has reverberated
globally. Here is what we are doing to maintain forward momentum:

1) With your blessing, we will build a new architecture of States who share our principles of Internet freedom and are
committed to not just espousing those principles, but collaborating in measurably reducing the number of States that
countervail the freedoms you outlined in your speech.

2) Jared and I met with Stanford President John Hennessy last week and we will work through Stanford to indirectly
launch an innovation competition for the best apps and programs that provide tools for circumvention of politically
motivated censorship.

'3) Maria Otero and Bob Hormats will co-chair a session in which we are hauling in the major, relevant technology
 companies. There may be some squealing, but we want to ensure that the private sector understands our values and
 make more carefully considered decisions about the deals they cut with foreign governments. In these meetings, we will

also look for the private sector to contribute resources (financial, engineering, hardware, etc.) in support of your
Internet Freedom objectives. Finally, we intend to build an industry-led coalition with a set of standards that have real
teeth and accountability.

4) We will be deploying our Civil Society 2.0 team to work with local stakeholders in key environments on capacity
building that will enhance their ability to address the key issues you articulated in your Internet freedom speech.

There are other activities which I can detail separately and will review with Cheryl and Jake.

My best,
Alec
