Huma and Cheryl...hope this finds you well...please thank Secretary Clinton for her faith in us.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, Senator Casey, I can't thank you enough for asking that question, because I
think you are 100 percent right. I obviously believe that what we're doing is part of our security. And I think
that case is certainly more understandable for people today, since 9/11, than it might have been beforehand. But
I also think it is essential to our economy.

You illustrate one example of that, the Export-Import Bank. We really believe that we can do even more
through the EXIM Bank, and I'm going to try to encourage that approach. Somebody asked me what I'd like to
do; I said I'd like to put EXIM Bank on steroids because I think it does so much good work for American
companies, and I want American businesses to know that.
