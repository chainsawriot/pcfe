Dear Hillary and Anne-Marie,




For several months I've been advising on a project to take the rainforest restoration work of Dr. Willie Smits, an
Indonesian agroforester, to scale on Borneo. That Smits Model effort now has an economically sustainable design with
multiple benefits for the local forest population, the nation of Indonesia, and the planet. The business plan has been
developed by an experienced and highly reputable investment group that serves in an Advisory role to the Prince of
Wales's Trust, and the business plan has already engaged the interest of the P8, a group of the eight largest global
pension funds.




The core goals of the Arenga Reforestation Project include greenhouse gas reduction, habitat restoration, rainforest
remediation, deforestation protection, biofuel production that is non-food and carbon-positive, and poverty alleviation
for some of the most vulnerable populations on the planet. The Internal Rate of Return, on a fairly mature business
model and seven years of module testing, calculates to about 34% -- a decent investment return for almost any industry.




You can watch Willie Smits describe the possibilities at TED (to a standing ovation) here:

The State Department has been on the periphery of the concept development through Moira O'Neill, a Haas Professor
of Business on loan to USAID from Cal. She has kept the conversation going with the White House, USAID, and State, but
is extremely busy with a range of other obligations and may not have the cycles to follow this to a conclusion.




In my view this effort, the Arenga Reforestation Project, is the leading contender for an economically sustainable
tropical reforestation program, and has an unprecedented climate mitigation potential (Indo'nesia is the world's #4
greenhouse-gas emitter, due largely to the burning and composting of the southern Kalimantan peat swamps and to
rapid destruction of rainforest, both of which the Smits Model can reverse). In Aug 08 I spent 11 days visiting key sites of
this project in Borneo, largely with Dr. Smits, whom I've known for about 20 years. In my opinion, and that of many
others, this is the world's most sophisticated and powerful model for integrated ecological and economic restoration,
with exciting prospects for much of the tropics. I can also vouch for the quality and integrity of the key people involved.




To make the impact even more noteworthy, the Minister of Forestry in Indonesia has now agreed to a 1:1 acreage
match between Smits Model reforestation and the protection of virgin rainforest in perpetuity as national park. For
every 30,000 hectares of Smits Model reforestation, the Ministry will designate 30,000 hectares (about 116 square
miles) of virgin rainforest a National Park, and they have agreed to external monitoring by international NGOs for
compliance. Since this Smits Model can scale to a million hectares, or ten million, with continually increasing economic,
social, and environmental benefits, the two-fer impact is perhaps unprecedented.




It would be worthwhile for you to have someone from your staff take a look at this. In my carefully considered view, the
political, social, and REDD benefits could be very substantial, and the possibility of a Public-Private Partnership is worth
consideration.




The primary source for information on the project in the US is my friend and Senior Fellow at RMI, the remarkable Eric
Rasmussen, MD, MDM, FACP CEO of the Google-founded humanitarian NGO called InSTEDD. He's leading, pro bono,
the team developing the business plan, and can be reached at                             or on cell at                         B6
