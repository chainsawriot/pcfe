I've already met with him but will follow up again. Have an idea I think he may be able to help with.

Safe travels.

Raj is off to a brilliant start and thank you for the help you provided him.

We share your assessment of Pakistan's need for a public narrative and better capacity to communicate effectively.
Judith has been working on how we improve our comm work there, and I know you were talking to the Pakistani
Ambassador about helping them. I'm copying Judith and asking that the two of you discuss what we could do given the
very difficult political landscape.

Thx for all your good counsel. We need to follow thru on the campaign for women we discussed some months back. Are
you still assisting Melanne? Let me know what I can do to hurry it along. H

Mme Secretary:

I'm glad I got to see you at Raj's swearing-in. Hope you liked the speech. Alonzo said we hit the right notes and Raj is off
to a strong start.

Of course I was kidding about "running away" from your "long list" of things you wanted to talk about with me. I'm
happy to talk anytime.

In fact, it would be good to touch base on the women's initiative and Pakistan. I've been talking with NDI's highly
regarded country director in Pakistan, who says communications is a desperate need and will definitely do some good
for the government.

Look forward to seeing you again soon. All the best, Doug
