Subject: (AP) Police to seek terror charges against Americans

ISLAMABAD - Pakistani police say they plan to ask a court to charge five Americans arrested in early December with
terrorism, and will seek life imprisonment sentences against them. A senior police investigator in Sargodha said the men
would appear in an anti-terrorist court on Jan. 4. He said police had almost concluded their investigation and that they
were "certain that these five Americans wanted to carry out attacks in Pakistan." Gujar didn't say what authorities
believe the men intended to target.
