Did you read all the way down? She died today.F—I4s are in the bottom email. She was a valiant fighter who
squeezed out a lot of life over a long time against tough odds. Here's to Judy and her indomitable spirit!

And, how are you, Dear One? I'm still seeing you and        in my mind's eye on the dance floor last week--showing
everyone how it's done! Let's hear it for the Sixties!! Much love to you all--xxoo H
