I'm involved in preparations for the Holbrooke memorial service at the Kennedy Center on Jan.
14, and I need to get your guidance/decision on your own role. I'm reachable through Ops, or
on my cell                 although I'll be out-of-pocket between 5 and 7 this
afternoon/evening. Regards, Strobe
