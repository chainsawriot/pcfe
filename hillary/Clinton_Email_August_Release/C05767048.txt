Clinton edges Palin for most admired

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is the most admired woman in America, barely edging
out former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, according to a Gallup poll out Wednesday.

When Gallup asked 1,025 adults nationwide to name the woman they admire most, 16
percent picked Clinton. Palin was the only other woman to be mentioned by at least 10
percent, being selected by 15 percent of those surveyed.

Daytime talk show host Oprah Winfrey came in third with 8 percent, edging out first lady
Michelle Obama who got 7 percent.

Rounding out the top 10 were former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Queen
Elizabeth II, who both received 2 percent, along with former British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, poet Maya Angelou, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Elin
Nordegren Woods, wife of golfer Tiger Woods — all of whom received 1 percent.

Clinton has been named most admired woman by the poll 14 times, going back to her time
as first lady. Only then-first lady Laura Bush in 2001 and Mother Teresa in 1995 and 1996
have been able to knock Clinton from her perch, though Palin came close.

President Barack Obama ran away with the competition for most admired man, receiving
the endorsement of 30 percent of those polled.

Former President George W. Bush came in second with 4 percent, topping former South
African President Nelson Mandela's 3 percent.

Fox News host Glenn Beck, Pope Benedict XVI, the Rev. Billy Graham and Microsoft
founder Bill Gates all received 2 percent. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), former President
George H.W. Bush, former President Bill Clinton and Tiger Woods received support from
1 percent of those polled. Clinton and Woods tied for 10th place.
