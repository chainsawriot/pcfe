Will do. Before the plan was simply to have GB present and Cameron to respond. I'm trying to figure out what the
element of surprise is adding here.

Fyi. Can you determine when Shaun wants to talk?

Re: New developments on NI

Shaun regrets he cannot come here tomorrow. Here's the problem and the plan: Cameron is still quietly giving
encouragement to the Ulster Unionists, which, led by Reg Empey, are trying to scuttle the agreement somehow. So the
plan is for Shaunn to announce he will deliver a speech on Monday in the House of Commons presenting the
agreement—except that at the last second Gordon will step in on the floor for Shaun, requiring Cameron to respond,
theoretically forcing him to support the agreement. In his speech, Gordon will explicitly cite your role and support of the
US—among other things further cornering Cameron (and Empey). Shaun would like to speak with you soon depending
on how things are working out there, perhaps tomorrow (Sunday) or perhaps Monday (perhaps after Commons). Dinner
will be on a rain-check.
