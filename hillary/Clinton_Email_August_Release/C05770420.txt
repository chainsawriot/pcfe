Subject: (AP) Haiti prosecutors urge prison for U.S. missionary

PORT-AU-PRINCE (AP) - Prosecutors say a U.S. missionary should spend 6 months in prison for trying to take 33 children
out of the country following the January 12 earthquake. Prosecutor Sonel Jean-Francois told a court it is clear Laura
Silsby knew she had broken Haitian law. The prosecutor spoke after the Idaho woman testified on the first day of her
trial.
