I had a group call me today... It is "F & B Catering" who have an agreement they are working to finalize with the
International Disaster Relief Fund... One of the principles is Craig Fant. Their operation is on the Gulf Coast. The
agreement would be to provide meals to 120,000 folks a day for a year in Haiti. I did a good bit of due diligence thru the
afternoon with contacts I have on the coast, in Jackson and in the Delta (the ag region) and these folks did a lot of the
Katrina work and have the staging facilities in Gulfport to move their goods to Haiti... the facility, in fact, was built with
Katrina money as part of the single largest FAA grant in history... this airport is used as the staging and departure area
for troops going to Afghanistan... the cargo terminals and personnel are equipped and experienced in this type of work.
Also, there has been a solid, transparent and deliberate effort by this company to work with and buy products from
minority farmers in the Delta... I don't know your politics, etc. I don't know the details on your end, boss... I get so many
requests each month wanting me to offer good words, etc. to you on behalf of some entity... most of the time it's all
about the dollar signs I see in their eyes... I ignore them... but my discovery process of F & B Catering, their Katrina work,
the confidence in their capacity, the use of post Katrina federally funded facilities and the commitment to minority
farmers was all compelling... so I share! Thanks, ma'am.
