-The damage to Kabul Bank's credibility appears to be irreparable. Thousands of people are lining up at Kabul
Bank branches throughout the country to withdraw funds. While the situation is still orderly, there is mounting
frustration--particularly in the provinces-- that the bank is unable to give people back their full deposits, forcing
them to repeatedly return and stand in long lines to withdraw their money in increments. On Saturday close to
70 million dollars was withdrawn. Hajis (people who have provided funds to go to Haj) are also demanding
their money bank. The overall sense is that it is a matter of days before the government will be forced to take
over KB.

-There are also reports of security people employed at KB shaking people withdrawing money. The government
has responded by replacing KB security with ANSF and NDS guards.

-On a positive note, the adverse situation in KB bank has not affected the other banks. The majority of people
withdrawing funds from KB are opening new accounts in Afghan International Bank, Aziz Bank, among others.
The heads of these banks have successfully projected corruption at KB as something that is associated with the
leadership of KB rather than a more systematic problem affecting other banks. People are also turning to other
banks because the security situation leaves them worried about keeping their savings at home.

-In the very short run, the government has come out ahead in this crisis. People are reassured that President
Karzai has actively taken control of the situation and is showing leadership. But this is clearly the biggest crisis
that President Karzai has faced in the last nine years. A number of the political elite are privately noting that the
situation could escalate and people could turn against the government once they feel the effects of this crisis.
Corruption, which President Karzai has cast a western concern, is now seen by Afghans as a fundamental
problem within the government.

-While the majority of media outlets have been cautious to not criticize the Government, fearing that it could
lead to further instability, this is expected to change in the coming days. Abdullah Abdullah has been one of the
few voices that has come out and noted that the Government was an active agent in the KB scandal, pointing
out in a press conference today that government cronyism was a big factor in this crisis and noting that no steps

have been taken to hold accountable those who illegally gambled with people's money. GIRoA is expected to
come increasingly under such criticism as further evidence of government negligence and complicity
becomes publicly known.

-Perhaps in an effort to deflect attention from this issue, the Government announced yesterday that the the High
Peace Council will be established after Eid. Jihadi leaders such as Rabbani, Mujaddidi, Sayyaf are expected to
feature prominently in the body. Women are expected to comprise 20% or 30% of the 50-60 council.
