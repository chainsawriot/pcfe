JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Militants in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip fired a rocket into southern Israel on September 4, two
days after the start of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, causing no injuries or damage, the Israeli military said. The cross-
border rocket fire was the first since Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu met in Washington to relaunch peace negotiations.
