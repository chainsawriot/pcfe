Hillary, as promised, I connected with Bruce Jones at NYU about Spanta. Bruce got in touch offered to help Spanta put
together an arrangement at NYU that might have a Brookings offshoot. Spanta said he needed to decide with Karzai
whether in fact the timing was right for him to leave. He just got back in touch with Bruce saying he's decided to stay on
a bit longer. That said, he's agreed to participate in some Track II regional work that Bruce has underway. All in all, it
sounds as though this has ended up in the right place for now. Bruce, Martin and I will be open to other NY/DC
possibilities down the road when Spanta's situation changes. Thanks again for the truly terrific event at Brookings.
Regards, Strobe
