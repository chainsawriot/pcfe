Jake

You may remember that I called on you early in the Administration on the UN statement on sexual
orientation. You were tremendous as was the Secretary. This request is not in keeping with the regular
hierarchy, but I had to send it. The video the Secretary did is extraordinarily powerful. Can you let her know
that individual employees in the building appreciate what she has been doing on LGBT rights? I know GLIFFA
will do so, but it's kind of their job to advocate. But if you could just tell her in a minute how deeply her work
is touching us in the trenches, well, it's something I think she deserves to hear.
