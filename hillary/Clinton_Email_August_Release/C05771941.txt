Re: GOP unpopularity, Boehner unpopularity, stealth agenda for campaign and beyond


   The Republican Party, despite everything, remains deeply unpopular. (See the second Ohio poll below.)
   The Republicans have made the election a referendum on Obama and the Democrats, succeeding beyond
      their wildest dreams. (See the first poll below on Obama-Bush matchup and question 12 in second poll
      on Ohio voters' recall on who they voted for in 2008, giving McCain a three point margin.)
   The Republicans have managed to hide their own negatives through the negative campaign against Obama.
   The campaign is not being conducted as a contest. The Republicans have succeeded in making it only about
      approval of Obama.
   The GOP is hiding John Boehner, who is unpopular in his home state of Ohio, where he's best known. To
      the extent he is known, he is disliked.
   The Republicans are pretending they offer something new and not really the same old Republicans, to the
      extent they make any sort of offer.
   The Tea Party is deliberately trying to hide its extremism behind a mask of novelty and now religious
      rhetoric. (The right wing strategy has been spelled out in detail to a friend of mine,



   So tar, there is no Democratic campaign to focus on the Republicans and, therefore, no contest. Republicans
       are not being exposed for their increasing dependence on extremists. They are not being pressed for their
       refusal to denounce extremism. Nor is the Tea Party being revealed as an extremist takeover movement.
       Nor is the Republicans' motive for smearing Obama being identified as a cynical strategy to put
       Boehner in power.
   Whatever issue ginned up by Republicans—from illegal immigration to the "ground zero mosque"—is not
       about the issue itself. Everything, but everything, is about making John Boehner, that old scandal ridden

      hack Republican, the Speaker. No matter what the Republicans say, the ultimate issue is the Boehner
      power-grab.
   The Republican Party is the same old party. It's unreformed. It hasn't learned anything. It can't control its
      extremists.

Previewing Ohio

We'll start rolling out our Ohio poll results tomorrow but there's one finding on the poll that pretty much sums it
up: by a 50-42 margin voters there say they'd rather have George W. Bush in the White House right now than
Barack Obama.

Independents hold that view by a 44-37 margin and there are more Democrats who would take Bush back
(11%) than there are Republicans who think Obama's preferable (3%.)

A couple months ago I thought the Pennsylvanias and Missouris and Ohios of the world were the biggest
battlegrounds for 2010 but when you see numbers like this it makes you think it's probably actually the
Californias and the Wisconsins and the Washingtons.

There's not much doubt things are getting worse for Democrats.. .and they were already pretty bad. Somehow
the party base needs to get reinvigorated over the next two months or there's going to be a very, very steep price
to pay.

QUESTIONS ABOUT THE POLL: TOM JENSEN 919-744-6312
GOP Leads OH Generic Ballot, Boehner Not Popular
Raleigh, N.C. — Despite expanding their lead to 47-41 over Democrats in the generic
Congressional ballot, only 29% of likely Ohio voters approve of the direction of the
Republican Party, with 55% disapproving, suggesting that their preference for the GOP is
simply a vote for change, not a vote of affirmation or a mandate. Also supporting that
notion: a 43% plurality finds the GOP to be too conservative, with only 29% seeing their
views as "about right."
And in bad news for Minority Leader John Boehner, only 28% of his home-state voters
want him to become Speaker if Republicans take back the U.S. House, with 44%
preferring "someone else." GOP voters do support Boehner for Speaker, but only by a
54-15 margin. Democrats, who would not vote for a Republican majority anyway,

oppose him, 73-6, and independents, 41-22.
In June, Republicans were favored for Congress only 44-43 among registered voters, but
the six-point shift in the partisan makeup of the likely electorate corresponds almost
exactly with the shift in the generic ballot. On top of that, Republicans are united around
their party's candidates 94-1, versus Democrats at 89-6. Democrats have actually
improved slightly among independents, though Republicans still lead 36-23. There is
considerable room for Democratic House candidates to make up ground by appealing to
the 41% of unaffiliateds who are undecided and by boosting turnout among their voters.
While Republicans approve of the direction of their party, 59-20, independents
disapprove, 61-13. 31% of Republicans and 20% of independents find the GOP too
liberal, but 76% of Democrats and 43% of independents find it too conservative.
There has been no change in the race for Attorney General. Mike DeWine leads
Democrat Richard Cordray 44-40 after leading 44-41 in June.
PPP surveyed 475 likely Ohio voters from August 27th to 29th. The margin of error for
the survey is +/-4.5%. Other factors, such as refusal to be interviewed and weighting,
may introduce additional error that is more difficult to quantify.

Email from                      9/6/10, on interview

Off the record: I had long conversation yesterday with                                very scary. His
prediction: "a wave of Biblical proportions" in Novem3er. the House is gone; he sees a new bloc of up to 10
true conservative senators, joining Coburn and DeMint, and creating a virtual third party in Senate holding
balance of power. He says their polling suggests Tea Party candidates well ahead in Ky. Colo. senate races
(NYT disputes that today) , and Nevada still a tossup. .1 went to the Glenn Back rally, an
largely agreed with my assessment that its purpose in part was to inoculate the movement against public
concern over extremism and racism leading up to election. (Thus theme of Faith, Hope, Charity.) Americans for
Prosperity (Koch group) made sure there were no signs, etc.

No love lost for post-1996 Republican hacks, among whom he numbered Gingrich, DeLay, Hastert -- and Rove
who is on the outs with his people.

Oversight committees will take lead in House after GOP victory, with a particular focus on Holder and Justice
Dept. and KSM decision. Purpose will be to keep Democrats on defensive for whole 2 years leading up to 2012
election. (Obama, you recall, nixed investigations of Bush administration because he wanted to unite the
country.) Would there be an investigation of Obama citizenship?? couldnt say b ecause he is now totally
focused on the election, not what comes after.

                 My take: Of course House will vote to repeal health care reform (despite no chance of senate
passage) ; funding dozens of EPA initiatives in Appropriations Committee, and there will be stand-alone vote to
block EPA from implementing carbon rules (even though EPA is only acting as a result of a Supreme Court
decision); and budget legislation that adopts part of the Ryan plan (tho not privatization of SS.)..
