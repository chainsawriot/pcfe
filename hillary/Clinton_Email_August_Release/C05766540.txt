Subject: (AP) US Congress Party Switch

WASHINGTON - Senior House aides say freshman Democratic lawmaker Parker Griffith of Alabama is switching to the
Republican Party. Griffith was narrowly elected last year from a region of northern Alabama that includes Huntsville and
Decatur. President Barack Obama lost the district badly to Republican John McCain. Griffith is a radiation oncologist. His
switch comes as Congress is trying to pass a much-contested health care bill. Democrats will still control the House by a
substantial margin.
