I assume you all are aware of these and others and this not even complete—have you all had any
conversation with Cristen about posting any of this content?

Very impressive!

Here's few press/blog links I found about the 1000 days launch by searching 1000 days + Clinton on Google. Danielle
also said there was a brief blurb about it on the Today Show. Some of these sites are cross posted elsewhere. Most just
recap the event or pull some of the transcripts in.

I stopped trying to list them all (too many and mostly the same), but its been picked up in local papers throughout the
country and some international papers in China, India, UK, Africa.

Lindsay, when will the recorded launch event be posted on the website? I believe it may already be on YouTube.


Best,

Katie
