The new year is bound to bring in a continuing wave of crisis around the world. Consider this photo a
momentary respite. It is evocative of the good feeling you engender everywhere. The photo is of the Director
of New Life Center in Chiang Mai. They are doing incredible work there and have made exceptional progress
since your visit. They remember you with great gratitude. I had one of your signed photos left after
distributing the others to the Burmese women human rights leaders (who also felt that you were on their
side).

Everywhere I went over the holidays, there was much favorable comment about your leadership. I'm so proud
to be back working with you. Because you've created such ripples of hope, we've got so much to do!

Love to all the Clintons and best wishes for a healthy, happy, productive and rewarding New Year.
