SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED


JAMAICA


    •   Eric Boswell reported that the embassy and two international schools that U.S. dependent children attend are
        closed today because of violence connected with the efforts to arrest the drug trafficker Coke. Consular Affairs
        put out a new Travel Warning yesterday warning against travel to the Kingston area. DS has a heavy security
        team on the ground.

CONGRESSIONAL ISSUES


    •   The Supplemental is on the Senate floor today. Not too many troublesome amendments yet. Not clear
        whether Senator Landrieu will submit hers.

    •   Rich noted an effort to get State nominees approved this Thursday —6 are on the calendar, but two (Robert Ford
        and Carmen Aponte) will not move for other reasons.

LEGAL ISSUES


    •   Harold noted that, if at all possible, he would like to brief the Secretary on the ICC Review Conference and the
        "crime of aggression" issue before he leaves for the conference in Uganda this week.

    •




PUBLIC AFFAIRS


    •   PJ pointed to an article in today's Washington Post as part of a concerted effort to focus on the transition from a
        military to a civilian-led effort in Iraq.

    •   Glenn Kessler called last night regarding a snarky piece he is writing about the relative lack of the Secretary's
        travel to Israel in comparison with her predecessors.
