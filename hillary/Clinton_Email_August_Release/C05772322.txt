Caitlin

I must congratulate state department on setting up the fund for Pakistan. In my opinion this is a great initiative and will
message to all American Business Forum members regarding the information on the fund.

Once again thank for all your support to Pakistan and look forward to working with you. Please do let me know if I or the
Forum could be any help to you in Pakistan.

Best regards
