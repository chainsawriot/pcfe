Subject: Rep. Meek is Haiti - details

Flew into Santo Domingo last night. Went overland to PaP. With Amb. Merten in Haiti.
About to do an aerial tour w/Amb. Planning on going out with S. Florida search and response teams. (Was former State
trooper so we think he has some experience in search and rescue, but cannot know for sure.) He's doing this on his
own, so we're not sure what he's planning.

His staff had been trying to persuade him not to travel for at least the immediate future, but it clearly didn't work. He
has received too many phone calls from constituents encouraging him to go.

Contacts in his office:
Clarence Williams Chief of Staff                 (Cell Phone)
Hassan Christian.                (I've been talking to him.)
