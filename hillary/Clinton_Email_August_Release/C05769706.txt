Jake,




Thanks very much to you and 5 staff for getting S' signature on the joint letter to EP Parliament President Buzek.




At the risk of pressing my luck, I wonder if she would be willing to go ahead and make the three calls â€” Westerwelle,
Papandreou + Miliband.

The German call is most important. The Ger EU commissioner is holding up Commission statement supporting the
interim agreement.

I will send updated call sheet.
