Subject: (Reuters) Iran, Turkey and Brazil agree on fuel swap deal

TEHRAN (Reuters) - Turkey's Foreign Minister said that an agreement had been reached between Iran, Turkey and Brazil
over procedures to revive a stalled U.N.-backed nuclear fuel swap deal. When Ahmet Davutoglu was asked by reporters
in Tehran whether there would be agreement on the nuclear fuel swap deal, he replied: "Yes, it has been reached after
almost 18 hours of negotiations." Turkey's foreign ministry said a formal announcement might be made on the morning
of May 17 after any final revisions by the Brazilian and Iranian presidents and the Turkish Prime Minister who reached
the agreement at talks in Tehran.
