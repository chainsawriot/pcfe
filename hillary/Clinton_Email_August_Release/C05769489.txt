Just seeing this. Can you ask Ops to call him and connect him to my house?

MS, the Spanish FM just called through Ops â€” he is boarding a plane from Cuba in about 30-40 minutes and would like to
speak with you as soon as possible. Would you like Ops to connect the call to the residence or wait until tomorrow?
