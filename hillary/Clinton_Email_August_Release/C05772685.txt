Subject: (AP) Serbian anti-gay riots send wrong message to EU

BELGRADE (AP) â€” Serbia's failure to prevent anti-gay riots could hurt its bid to join the European Union, a EU official
said. Jelko Kacin, in charge of the European Parliament's evaluation reports on Serbia, said in a statement the anti-gay
riots "show an elementary lack" of tolerance for minority rights in Serbia and the "inefficiency" of the state in preventing
such a trend. "A very bad message was sent from Belgrade" that could hurt its bid to join the EU, the Slovenian official
said. The gay pride march, was viewed as a major test for Serbia's government, which has pledged to protect human
rights as it seeks EU membership.
