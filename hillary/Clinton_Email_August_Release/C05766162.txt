I just came from Georgetown and talked to Jack et al.                  applied for "early action" —that is to be
guaranteed admittance without applying elsewhere. The decision on "early action" is based on grades and scores — the
most empirical measures. It is EXTREMELY difficult to be accepted EARLY at Georgetown She was deferred until the
spring — through the regular process when they will weigh all her strengths. There is never any guarantee but this is the
situation for early action.

Everyone is excited about the speech tom'w. I wish I could go but have to be here for another event at State. I've gone
back and forth with speechwriters. I know it will be terrific.
