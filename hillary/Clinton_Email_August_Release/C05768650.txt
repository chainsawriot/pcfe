                                                                                                          The. Assembly passed a
    good anti-trafficking law a day ago because of her leadership. I think it's a first for the region.
    I saw the FM today. He said, "Tell dear Hillary that I send hugs."
    I'm heading home finally. Its been intensive but very good. They love you here.

    I had a good visit with her. She very much wants you to come to Egypt for the major anti-trafficking event she is doing in
    December and sends you her regards.
    Egypt is making good progress on women's issues: prosecuting child marriage cases, combating FGM and they're close to
    passing a tough anti-trafficking law. Mrs M is the guiding force.
    She and the President appreciated your call after his surgery. The most difficult part of our conversation was




â€¢   We also announced our partnership with egypt for the training of. Afghan midwives at the suzanne mubarek health
    center in Alexandria.
