Subject: (Reuters) Russia warns of conflict between North and South Korea

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia warned that "conflict" could break out any day between North and South Korea, saying
tension between the two countries was at its worst in a decade. The unusually stark words by Russian deputy foreign
minister Alexei Borodavkin come two months after the North said it would wage a "sacred war" against the United
States and its ally, South Korea. Washington replied that it would not enter a "war of words" with the North.
