MS,
The Argentina desk is working this issue on your behalf. They will be in touch with the sender of the letter (Mr. Ramer in
California). The letter asks you to enter into a bilateral agreement with Argentina in order to rectify a Locally Employed
Staffer's (in Argentina) personal tax predicament. I'm happy to call Brian too, if you like.
