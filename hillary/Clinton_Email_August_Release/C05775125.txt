Subject: (Jerusalem Post) E. Jerusalem: Policeman injured, molotov thrown

(Jerusalem Post) - One policeman was injured in an altercation in Sheikh Jarrah, when police arrived on the scene of a
street fight and arrested four Arab residents.

After the arrest, other residents started throwing rocks at the police forces. One policeman was hit in the head with a
rock and was injured. He was treated on the scene. The police fired two warning shots into the air and the crowd
dispersed.

In a separate incident also on September 26, a molotov cocktail was thrown at police and border patrol forces on patrol
in the Givati parking lot near the entrance to Silwan and the City of David. The molotov cocktail exploded but there were
no injuries.

A sweep of the area by border patrol found three other molotov cocktails and three suspects were arrested.
