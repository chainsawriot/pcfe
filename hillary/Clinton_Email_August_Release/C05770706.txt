Sheba â€” Please pass to D.

The interagency briefing for Hill staff (leadership, foreign affairs, appropriations, arms services) today was
uneventful. Mostly predictable questions (where is China; effect on Iran resolution; defense posture...) and no criticism
of the way the Administration has handled this so far. Interestingly, no question or push on SSTL. If this exchange is a
good indication of Hill temperature, I think we are doing ok at the moment.
