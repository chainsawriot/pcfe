S. Remarks to participants at High Level Meeting on Food Security for All

President Obama has made clear that alleviating hunger worldwide is a top priority of this Administration. As he said on
the first day of his Presidency, "to the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms
flourish and let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds." The President and I intend to focus
new attention on food security so that developing nations can invest in food production, affordability, accessibility,
education and technology.
