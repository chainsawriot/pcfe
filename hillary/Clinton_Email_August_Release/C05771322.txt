I just want to make sure you saw this. It is the end of a piece Tony Blair did for Time this week that is adapted from his
book. It is very close to what you said on Friday. He also has a line at the beginning of the piece where he talks about
loving "America's sense of aspiration." AM

Americans can be all that the rest of the world sometimes accuses them of: brash, loud, insular, obsessive and heavy-
handed. But America is great for a reason. It is looked up to, despite all the criticism, for a reason. There is a nobility in
the American character that has been developed over the centuries, derived in part, no doubt, from the frontier spirit,
from the waves of migration that form the stock, from the circumstances of independence, from the Civil War, from a
myriad of historical facts and coincidences. But it is there.




That nobility isn't about being nicer, better or more successful than anyone else. It is a feeling about the country. It is a
devotion to the American ideal that at a certain point transcends class, race, religion or upbringing. That ideal is about
values: freedom, the rule of law, democracy. It is also about the way you achieve: on merit, by your own efforts and

hard work. But it is most of all that in striving for and protecting that ideal, you as an individual take second place to the
interests of the nation as a whole. It is what makes the country determined to overcome its challenges. It is what makes
its soldiers give their lives in sacrifice. It is what brings every variety of American, from the lowest to the highest, to their
feet when "The Star-Spangled Banner" is played. Of course the ideal is not always met â€” that is obvious. But it is always
striven for.




The Need for American Confidence


The next years will test the American character. America won't be loved in this presidency any more than in previous
ones. But America should have confidence. That ideal, which produces the optimism that generates the achievement, is
worth all the striving. It is the most precious gift a nation can have. The world is changing. New powers are emerging.
But this does not diminish the need for that American ideal. It reaffirms it, renews it, gives it added relevance. There is
always one, more prosaic, test of a nation's position: Are people trying to get into it, or to get out of it? I think we know
the answer to that in America's case, and that ideal is the reason.




A friend of mine whose parents were immigrants, Jews from Europe who came to America in search of safety, told me
this story. His parents lived and worked in New York. They were not well off. His father died when he was young. His
mother lived on, and in time my friend succeeded and became wealthy. He often used to offer his mother the chance to
travel outside America. She never did. When eventually she died, they went back to recover the safety box where she
kept her jewelry. They found there was another box. There was no key. So they had to drill it open. They wondered what
precious jewel must be in it. They lifted the lid. There was wrapping and more wrapping and finally an envelope.
Intrigued, they opened it. In the envelope were her U.S. citizenship papers. Nothing more. That was the jewel, more
precious to her than any other possession. That was what she treasured most. So should America today.
