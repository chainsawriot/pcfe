Subject: (AP) Iran blocks former president's website

TEHRAN (AP) - The website of former Iranian President Khatami announced authorities have blocked it without
explanation.
  A statement on Khatami.ir said a government committee had decided to filter the website, which on November 4
could only be reached from inside Iran through proxy servers.
  While the site was not known to be controversial, Khatami, president from 1997 to 2005, supported opposition leader
Mir Hossein Mousavi in 2009 presidential election that led to re-election of President Ahmadinejad.
  Earlier this year authorities banned Khatami from traveling to Japan to attend a conference.
