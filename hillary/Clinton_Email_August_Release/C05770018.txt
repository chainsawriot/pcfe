Subject: (AP) Rwanda court grants medical bail to US lawyer

KIGALI (AP) - A judge in Rwanda granted bail to a U.S. lawyer on medical grounds. Peter Erlinder was arrested and
charged with genocide ideology late last month. Since his arrest he's been hospitalized multiple times. A judge in Kigali
granted Erlinder bail on medical grounds, but it wasn't immediately clear if Erlinder is allowed to leave
Rwanda. Erlinder's brother, Scott Erlinder, said he suspects political pressure from around the world contributed to the
judge's ruling.
