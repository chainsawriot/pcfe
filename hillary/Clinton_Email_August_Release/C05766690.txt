She just did. I'm just telling my son the good news. Cross your fingers that all goes as scheduled tomorrow and we'll be
fine. Thanks so much - and happy holidays! Hope you get a break.

Subject: Visa for India

Dear Huma,

As I explained on the phone, we've hit a brick wall in trying to get a visa for my son                      to travel to
India. We are scheduled to leave on Saturday, December 26, but without a visa he of course cannot go and I will not go
without him. My visa has been issued by Travisa Outsourcing, the company to which the Government of India has
outsourced all visa processing. However, despite the fact that Travisa does all of India's visa processing, and ordinarily
does it on a same-day basis, their office here in Washington, DC (located in Georgetown) refused to process my son's
visa application because he is a California resident and they are organized so that their various offices (New York,
Washington, San Francisco, Chicago, and
Houston) issue visas only for residents of the immediate vicinity of the particular office. Thus, for example, the
Washington office issues visas for residents of Delaware, Washington, DC, Maryland, West Virginia, and the like, but will
not process visas for residents beyond this area. The New York office, likewise, processes visas only for residents of New
York, New Jersey, CT, and the like, but not Washington. My son of course has a valid US passport, but the visa
requirements also require proof of residence, and because his driver's license is a California license (because that is his
residence), Travisa Outsourcing said they could not process his visa application.
They insisted that he have proof of DC residence, even though he is my son and I am a DC resident. (If he were my
minor child, or my spouse, they would have let him travel with me, but he is 30 years old and so they insist on evaluating
his residency documents independently of mine even though we are traveling together.)

We went to the DC Motor Vehicle Department after leaving Travisa Outsourcing to see whether he could get a non-
driver's photo ID issued by the District but that could only be done if he relinquished his California driver's license, which
of course he was not prepared to do. (Even to find that out, we had to first go to the Social Security Administration to
get proof of his SSN, which of course he has in California but not with him, and then we went back to the DMV only to
learn that a non-driver's ID here was not a realistic option.)

We then went to the Embassy of India, at 2536 Mass. Ave., NW, which is the part of the embassy that deals with
passports and consular affairs. They do not handle visas, of course, because that has been outsourced to Travisa.
Nonetheless, I had hoped that we might get someone at the Embassy to agree to issue his visa here in Washington.
Although two polite gentlemen did speak to us, they insisted that his
visa could be issued only in San Francisco. Given the imminence of
the Christmas holidays and the impossibility of doing this either in person (he is already in Washington for Christmas and
thus he cannot get back to California to get his visa issued there and still get back to Washington for the holiday and our
departure from Washington on Saturday, Decemberr 26th) or by FedEx because of holiday closings, we have no choice
but to cancel our trip to India. This is a trip we planned together and I will not go without him, and the holidays mean
that we cannot realistically rearrange his flights to follow mine because, by the time he had a visa, the trip would be half
over.

I am not sure what can be done as I recognize that the decision is up to the Government of India but, as I mentioned, I
thought it was worth asking whether there was any way in which you might assist us. Should that prove possible, his
pertinent information (the information required by Travisa) is:




                                                    Type of visa requested - tourist Purpose of trip - vacation Places to be
visited - Delhi, Udaipur, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Agra He has never been to India before and is not traveling on behalf of any
company, nor is he holding a valid "no objection to return to India" endorsement (a question asked on Travisa's form)

Huma, I do realize that there may be nothing that can be done, but I very much appreciate your sending this along to the
appropriate people who might be able to evaluate the situation. Tomorrow (Wednesday,
12/23) I will either be in my office or running a few errands but I am reachable on my cell phone or office phone, and
both numbers are below. I am also reachable by email as I will have my BlackBerry with me.

Best regards,
