Hi. I'm very sorry, but I just saw this. Don't know how it escaped my attention. I will track it down tomorrow. I don't
know off hand. Hope you had a good Thanksgiving. Jen and kids and I were in Chicago. See you tomorrow.

Dear Todd--

A friend forwarded me the email reprinted below. Do you know what it refers to?
Obviously, I'm prepared to help. Just let me know. Thx and Happy Thanksgiving!



I just realized, it was Hillary who made the big adaptation promise at Copenhagen. We're trying to get Nelson to join
Boxer in pushing Levin to include the adaptation authorization language (no cost) to the Def Auth. It would be a HUGE
win for our community and also, it seems, for Hillary. Do you think that is something her crew might weigh in on? It's
really a small ask and very easy lift...the problem is it just hasn't been a high priority. But we now have Boxer who says
she'll champion if she can get an ally on Armed Services to approach Levin. So if Hillary's folks could engage Nelson
(and/or Levin) to get them on board, that would be HUGE. I know there is a lot out there to her, but it seems like with
this and ATT, what we're asking is very much in her interest and as much a gift as a request.
