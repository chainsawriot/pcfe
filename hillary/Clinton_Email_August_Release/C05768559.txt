Subject: Decision on NATO Ministerial not expected until this evening

Good morning,

Per Brian Greaney, USNATO, NATO will attempt to send an estimated 20-30 staff members to Tallinn this
evening. Should the group, likely including interpreters, security personnel and technicians, be unable to complete the
trip, the Ministerial likely will be cancelled. USNATO will continue to monitor and report to Ops as they learn more.



Thanks,

Ken Zurcher
