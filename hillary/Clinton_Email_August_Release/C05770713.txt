I talked with Moratinos. He said he talked with with Abbas and Erakat (and will see them in Amman on Tuesday; he thinks the
meeting in Brussels tomorrow will last only one day)t

                                                                                                            \I told him that I would       B1
report to you and get back to him; he requested that you call Ashton; I said I would pass along the request (I didn't feel at liberty to   1.4(B)
disclose that you had already done so).                                                                                                    1.4(D)

OK, will do. Please let me know results of Ashton call as this will be helpful to know in my calls with other EU FMs.

I asked State Ops to call Moratinos; they said you had previously asked and they wanted to know which order to call. Do you want to
call him first or do you want me to call and report to you and then you call?
