From Landler today, middle of the piece -- not too much to it:

Israel also took issue with the Obama administration's assertion that the United States had warned Israeli
officials to exercise caution and restraint in intercepting the flotilla.

"I was not contacted by anyone in the administration about this," said Michael B. Oren, Israel's ambassador to
the United States. Mr. Oren said he was not aware that anybody else in the Israeli government had been called
and was seeking clarification from the administration.

A spokesman for the State Department, Philip J. Crowley, said the United States had "extensive contacts" with
Israel and Turkey before the flotilla set sail. "We expressed to the Israelis the need for caution and restraint in
dealing with civilians, including American citizens," he said.
