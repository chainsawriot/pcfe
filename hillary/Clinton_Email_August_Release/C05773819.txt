Subject: Suicide attack kills 10 in NW Pakistan




PESHAWAR (AP) - A local government official said a suicide car bomber attacked a tribal police patrol in northwestern
Pakistan, killing 10 policemen. Rasheed Khan says the attacker rammed his car into a vehicle carrying the police on a
main highway in the Khyber tribal area near the Afghan border. Another 15 people were injured in the attack. No
group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but Taliban militants often target Pakistani security forces.
