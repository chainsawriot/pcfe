I never heard the earlier part of this debate




We shd not use our meeting w/ the DL to beat them up, but treat it like we would treat a meeting with a Coptic leader
from Egypt or a Bahai leader from Iran, etc. We have nothing to hide. Let the Chinese make a big issue out of it if they
want to; we will just do what we have always done.
