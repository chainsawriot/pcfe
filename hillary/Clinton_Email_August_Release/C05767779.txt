Its not like a traditional trade show/expo with specific booths. It is more subtle and the pavilion folks would negotiate
creatively on what they want..

Depdg on amount, they get on the big wall of contributors, we show multiple scenes of NYC in the shows and displays,
they can use the wonderful VIP lounge/auditorium to have NYC day or week at the Expo - the rockettes, Broadway goes
to China, commercial diplomacy, mtgs betwn NYC and Chinese officials, .getting SME's access to China etc. We could
really be creative.

LA, San Fran, San Antonio already in, chicago on way...

As you know the general theme is "Better Cities, Better Lives". How can NYC not be repped? They cam brag about their
innovations.

This will be an important two weeks to nail down these big companies. We are negotiating with them now about
possible options. I'll keep you posted.

May be good to mention this to Mayor Bloomberg if you run into him or see him. Doctoroff gave usfrom                        B4
Bloomberg, LLC but he thght the Mayor may be interested for the city.
