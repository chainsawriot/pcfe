This will be an important two weeks to nail down these big companies. We are negotiating with them now about
possible options. I'll keep you posted.

May be good to mention this to Mayor Bloomberg if you run into him or see him. Doctoroff gave us        from             B4
Bloomberg, LLC but he thght the Mayor may be interested for the city.

Google has been wierd about this whole deal but this whole Espo experience has been fascinating. Some companies will
say absolutely no for months (Qualcomm, Bloomberg, J&J) and then pop out of nowhere and say yes. Others like ATT are
in for       and then decide not to give us a penny. Therefore we have to keep bugging these guys.

We WILL raise the money. We are at $54M+ (this wk Hawaii came in for $500k and Bloomberg LLC              and need $7M
more. Ideally we would like to raise $10 to 11M to cover any overruns (it's getting more expensive because the US was
so late we are paying more now to build it quicker).

Where it will come from?

A- Right now we have three big companies talking to us in the range o          each - Monsanto, Disney, and Oracle.
Haier may go from          . If two or three come thru big we are done.

B- We also have a number of other companies like Invitrogen, Hormel, Mattel and Major League Baseball in the
    range.

C- Interestingly the cities and states are going to their private funders and trying to raise money on their own to
promote their jurisdictions - Chicago, Houston, Georgia, Montana, TN. (In the past, over 20 states participated with
public funds but current budgets are tough). Maybe a chat w Mayor Bloomberg would be worthwhile. For example, I
spoke to the University of WA and they will probably get benefactors to cosponsor at $250k making them the only
university represented.

D- We have approached groups like Pharma and the fashion industry thru Diane von Furstenburg to get them to bundle
smaller companies and both have agreed to do it. I met w DVL and she wants you to know that she is very excited about
helping (they are in the      range).

E- We have talked to the elusive Chamber of Commerce again about getting SME's to raise $2-3M in smaller increments.
They are contemplating it.

Finally the two obvious industries that are not involved are the banks (and we know why) and the insurance companies
who are starting to look into the market over there.

Anyway, I did not mean to go on and on but that's where we stand and these are the potential areas to tap. We'll get
there.

On your last Q - I too heard that

I don't think I made any progress. What will it mean if we can't raise the remaining $? Where else can we try?

Do you know how

I noticed on your schedule that you are meeting with a number of tech CEO's this evening. Google should be an obvious
co-sponsor of the USA Pavilion and they have consistently pushed us off. Although they bring up IP issues as a reason
not to participate, the Chinese frequently note that they do a lot of business in China. We are now at $54 million. If the
opportunity arises, it would be helpful to note the importance of a USA standing in Shanghai.
