Jake, Joe,
Here is the update from 10 and PRM for the Secretary (as you recall she had met with the outgoing head of UNFPA):

Eric and I would like to update you on the Secretary-General's selection process of the next head of UNFPA.

Working closely with PRM and USUN, we gathered 22 names as possible candidates from various sources, including
NG0s, governments, and respected individuals in the health sector. We whittled down this list to three people who
have qualifications that we believe are necessary for the job: a deep understanding of and support for UNFPA's
reproductive health/family planning mission and its critical role in implementing the 1CPD Program of Action, strong
leadership and advocacy skills, and strong management ability to oversee an organization with over 2000 employees
worldwide.

We see the leading candidates as:




USUN concurs and is in touch with the SG's office to convey our views. The SG will make his own shortlist based on a UN
review panel's recommendations. He is expected to announce his selection in October to allow the designee some
overlap with the incumbent, Thoraya Obaid, whose term expires at the end of the year. We will keep you apprised as
the process continues.

Esther
