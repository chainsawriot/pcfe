Subject:                           Thank you



Madam Secretary,

Thank you so much for making the time to address the reception celebrating the passage of the Defense Trade
Cooperation Treaties with the UK and Australia. Everyone in the room put forward tremendous effort towards achieving
the treaties passage and they appreciated the recognition of their efforts that you provided.

I'm working on a memo to you that will summarize PM's achievements during the first 18 months of my tenure as well
as the Bureau's priorities going forward. Once I send it up to you, I'll work with Eric, Jake, Cheryl, etc. on setting up a
time with you to discuss to ensure that we are capturing your priorities.

Thanks again.

Best, Andrew
