Subject: Brazil's Lula decides against extraditing Italian (Reuters)

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Lula da Silva said he would not extradite former Italian guerrilla
Cesare Battisti, a move that could damage relations with Italy. Brazil's Supreme Court had ruled last year that
Battisti should be extradited on murder convictions from the 1970s in Italy, but it left the final decision to Lula.
The move, announced in a statement released by the Brazilian government, was widely expected and comes a
day after Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi warned that such a decision would be "incomprehensible and
unacceptable." Brazilian media reported any decision still had to be verified by the Supreme Court but it was
not immediately clear whether this was just a formality.
