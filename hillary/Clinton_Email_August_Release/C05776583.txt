Subject: (AP) House votes to censure New York Rep. Rangel

WASHINGTON (AP) - Rep. Charles Rangel of New York has been censured by the House for financial and fundraising
misconduct.
  The vote December 2 was 333-79. It was only the 23rd time that the House invoked its most serious punishment
short of expulsion.
  The solemn procedure calls for Rangel to appear at the front of the chamber while Speaker Nancy Pelosi reads the
censure resolution.
  The 80-year-old Democrat has served in the House for 40 years.
