A big, warm hello and

As you may know, I signed up for hosting another holiday party with many Senate alum suggesting the idea as a way of
having a reunion and, hey, a party. We invited staff covering most of our years, and looks like a great collection will
come. It'll be pot-luck so not quite as elegant as before.

SO, just in case, and I'd imagine it's not possible, it'll be Monday night, 7:00 to 9:30, December 21.

No matter what, wanted you to know we are gathering yet again with our Senator Clinton bond.

love, T
