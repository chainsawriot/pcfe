FYI â€” the Senate is likely to pass the supp tonight. And, no nominees from any government agency will be
confirmed tonight or tomorrow. Would like to discuss the potential for recess appointments with you and
Cheryl.

The Brookings event, especially your opening remarks, were excellent. Very thoughtful, with lots of real-life
examples. We have gotten lots of positive feedback.
