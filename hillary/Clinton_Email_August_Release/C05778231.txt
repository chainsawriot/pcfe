Ok, he's pretty pissed about Crowley's response so it would be good if she can call at some point.

Any chance the Secretary could call Leahy to thank him this evening? The State Dept spokesman's reaction to Leahy's
statement didn't help.

          Of Funds To Haiti's Central Government
      And Of Travel Visas For The Government's Leaders
      Who Are 'Trying To Subvert The Will Of The People'
[(FRIDAY, Dec. 10) -- US. Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) Friday said he has urged the Obama Administration
to withhold funding to the central government of Haiti, and to suspend visas for travel to the United States by
senior Haitian Government officials and their immediate family members, until necessary steps are taken to
ensure a fair and democratic outcome to the elections held on November 28, 2010. Leahy chairs the Senate
Appropriations Committee 's Subcommittee on The State Department and Foreign Operations, which handles
the Senate 's work in funding foreign assistance, including aid to Haiti, and the State Department's
budget. Leahy also chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, which handles immigration policy issues. Leahy
released the following statement.]

"As if Haiti did not have enough problems, now, once again, those in power there are trying to
subvert the will of the people. The United States must come down squarely in support of the
Haitian people's right to choose their leaders freely and fairly. By suspending direct aid to the
central government and visas for top officials and their immediate family members, the United
States would be sending that message. This process needs to bring about a legitimate
government respected by the Haitian people and recognized by the international community."
