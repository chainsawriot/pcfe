She's sorta right. We post as much video as we can, and bat 1.000 on domestic events. Tougher on overseas events
since we don't have the resources abroad with us that we have here at home. We held a meeting with the web &

But generally speaking, it's a huge priority for us all to post video whenever possible.

                                  - i have a complaint about the website! i cant see video of your talks or q&a sessions -
only the text! i think there should be links to the news' versions if there is not state-created footage.
