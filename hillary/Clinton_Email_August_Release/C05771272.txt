BERKELEY (AP) - The aunt of an American woman released from an Iranian prison says her niece plans to hold a news
conference in New York. Sarah Shourd's aunt, Karen Sandys (san-dees), told The Associated Press on September 17 that
Shourd and her mother will travel September 18 from Oman to New York. Sandys says the news conference is planned
for September 19, when Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will be in New York for the UN General
