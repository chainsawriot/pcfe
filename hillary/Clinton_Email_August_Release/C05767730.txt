Subject: FOX and Adoptive Parents

FOX is focused on one family, Joshua and Elizabeth Daby of Rochester, NY, who have children standing to adopt, Johnny
and Marie. They are in this category where we are evidently waiting for the Government of Haiti to approve. I just did a
phone interview with Sheppard Smith and it turns out Mr. Daby, saying we are doing everything possible to move such
cases
