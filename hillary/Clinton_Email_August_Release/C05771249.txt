Hi Hillary -

Met Indra today for the first time. Spent the entire time not talking about me and my new law firm (!) but about you and
why we both admired and supported you so. And still do.

She is a most remarkable person. And quite devoted to you.

Her daughter Preetha, as you may know, started in Iowa and stayed on in campaign as volunteer all the way through
South Dakota and Montana.

And in all that time she never personally met you -- and "still grieves" (her mon's words) your loss. (Joining a big club!!!)

Can I call Cheryl and arrange a quick stop-by and handshake and photo any time--no rush--at your convenience?

Hope you are well - you look better than ever--as does President Clinton! And we are not getting any younger!!!

Warmest regards,

Lanny
