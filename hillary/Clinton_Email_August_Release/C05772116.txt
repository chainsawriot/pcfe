You were great this morning, truly. And your instincts on the speech were just right. I was very proud to be in the front
row. I am also enormously pleased that in the last 2 months we have gotten a major speech and a Foreign Affairs article
done with a lot of people working very well as a team -- exactly as it ought to be. That is a tribute to top-level
management and our ability to learn from experience and make improvements. It's a team I will be all the more sorry to
leave. But now for the QDDR I'll be home for the rest of the week writing hard
                file're going to get there -- cheryl taking hold has, as usual, been a huge help.
