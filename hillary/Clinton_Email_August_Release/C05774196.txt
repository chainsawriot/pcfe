Thought you'd like to see this. Rose did a great job, especially with Russian media, and the new system seems to be
working.

Sorry I didn't get to see you before you left. Hope you have a happy and peaceful holiday and actually manage to get a
bit of down time --- is that even possible???

Cheers,

jm

Since I send you guys the complaints when principals don't come through, thought it would be nice to send a positive
message when things go as they should. Rose is a champ and IME did great today.

I'll also add that when the dust settles this might warrant some kind of email to A/S Gottemoeller who was herself a
driving force behind getting this done, getting out on the Russian media tonight to get into Russian media cycle to help
advance policy. Sets a great example for her senior colleagues. Will send around the final round-up in a few.

Dana -


IME staff kicked ass tonight on New START. We arranged a press call for Gottemoeller with five Russian journos at 6:00
pm - and it went perfectly. Then two 1V interviews with Russian television from the mezzanine. BBC Russian radio to
top it. Thursday we're setting up a conference call for DC-based press (foreign and domestic) supplemented by reporters
from key countries in Europe such as Poland. (We're getting an assist on that from EUR and the Brussels Hub.)

We'll get Gottemoeller into the studio here tomorrow as well to do some clips that we'll push out on NewsMarket and
America.gov.

All told, a very nice foreign media package on very short notice - and on a very big ticket issue. My hat is off to Shai,
David, and Holly, and also to great collaboration from OBS and FPC.

Michael
