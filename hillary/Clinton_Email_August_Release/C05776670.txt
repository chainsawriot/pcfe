We sent the paper on consular fees to Tanner today, and his staff confirmed that he has received it. Assuming Tanner
continues to be supportive, we need him to let Hoyer know he supports our effort.

Additionally, Jack thinks it is important for you to talk to Pelosi. Berman mentioned that as well. I can send a call sheet
just in case you have a chance to connect with her.

Thanks again for stopping by the AIPAC meeting. It really helped close out some important issues.
