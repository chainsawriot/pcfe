BRUSSELS (AP) - Federal prosecutors in Belgium say 10 suspects have been detained after an anti-terror sweep in
Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. The prosecutors say in a statement those targeted in the sweeps were
suspected of planning a possible attack in Belgium. Others were suspected recruiters for an alleged Chechen terror
organization. Ten homes were searched in the three nations, and 10 suspects of Belgian, Dutch, Moroccan or Russian
nationality were detained. The statement said that investigation had previously already led to arrests in Spain, Morocco
and Saudi Arabia.
