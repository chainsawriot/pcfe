I just wanted to make sure you know that the CARE speech is now going to focus on nutrition/health/early childhood,
rather than being a major health speech. I still feel that you need to do a health speech as a bookend to food and water
â€” perhaps before UNGA. You could focus on health in the context of the larger Millennium Dev Goals. You have not
given a speech yet about maternal and child health. We have a great story to tell with our investment in GHI, and there
will be an opportunity to tell it with the ramp-up to UNGA (with the Summit focusing on MDGs). There is a tremendous
amount of activity going on elsewhere in the world. And this is a legacy issue for you. (I have already relayed this idea to
CDM and Jake).
