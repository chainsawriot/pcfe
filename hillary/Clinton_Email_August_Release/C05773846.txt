Jake, we just got off conf call re status of ep vote on tftp. The debate this aft was dramatic. The council + commission
apologized for mishandling the issue + begged mep's not to take out their frustration on interim agreement which is
saving lives. Both epp leader ver hofstadt + socialist leader schultz responded by openly advocating postponement.

After debate party leaders met but failed to achieve consensus on postponement.                                             B5




We are now working on contingency press guidance.
