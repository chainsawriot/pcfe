Subject: (AP) Bin Laden: Relief body needed for Muslim countries

CAIRO (AP) - Al-Qaida has released a new audio tape of Osama bin Laden in which the leader of the terror network calls
for the creation of a relief body to aid Muslims harmed in natural disasters and wars. In a copy of the message, bin
Laden also criticizes governments in Muslim countries for spending more money on armies than on their citizens. The
bin Laden tape comes after similar messages from al-Qaida figures that accused the Pakistani government of failing to
provide for its people after massive floods in the country killed hundreds and left some 8 million people homeless. The
authenticity of the tape could not be immediately verified.
