Dear Ms. Mills,

On a personal note, pls allow me to express my thanks for you and your team's long hours, hard work and dedication to
all Americans. As you well know, no family in grief can possibly think anything being done is enough for their loved one.

You and I both know that the efforts of everyone involved in the rescue/relief efforts, from the ramp loader to Secretary
Clinton has been nothing but 110%.

Thank you is not something you and your colleagues have likely heard a great deal in the last 9 days, so allow me to say,
THANK YOU.

Matt Chaloux
Proud American

We have seen a UN statement indicating that GOH has advised that but we have not had confirmation from GOH though
we are seeking that.

As you know, we still have a team at the Montana working.

On your second question, that is a larger issue we are working through for the entire disaster area which we'll update
publicly as we make assessments.
