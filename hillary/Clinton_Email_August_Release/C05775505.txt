Next time you feel like stepping all over your story by saying you are tired, use the line of the black woman in the
Montgomery bus boycott who walked to work: "My feet is tired, but my soul is rested."

On UK: Clegg held his own in the second debate last night. Gordon hit him as "anti-American." This feels like it's moving
to a hung parliament. Cameron can't break through. Two-thirds of the voters simply hate the Tories. No matter how well
Clegg does the system doesn't allow for any gain in seats to match his personal poll numbers. UK stunned by its first
series of debates and the whole campaign has atrophied in wonderment, little happening between the debates. Final
one next week, but guaranteed not to be conclusive, just a repetition, confirming the earlier two.
