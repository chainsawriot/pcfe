Subject: (Reuters) Arab League chief: talks no use if settlements built

CAIRO (Reuters) - The Arab League backs the Palestinians' refusal to continue direct peace talks if Israel resumes building
settlements, the organization's chief said September 16. "If settlement construction does not stop, then there is no use
for continuing negotiations," Amr Moussa told a press conference, saying this was the opinion of the Arabs and
Palestinian President Abbas. "Negotiating with occupation is simply a waste of time."
