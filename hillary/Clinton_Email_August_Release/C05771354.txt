Thx for the good additions and clarifications and I'd like to do a conf call whenever convenient. Can you give me time(s)
so I can plan?

Also, I think the beginning from last night (draft 20)reads better than the one in the last version (draft 22). Are there
specific points or phrases or sequencing from 22 that you believe should be added to 20?
