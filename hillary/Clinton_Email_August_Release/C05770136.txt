Subject: Reintegration Decree Signed -- Message to GEN Petraeus' Team?

Kabul Exec — could you please help me make sure that this gets to the Ambassador?

Ambassador --

Karzai's Chief of Staff, Omar Daudzai, called Annie this morning to relay that President Karzai did sign the Afghan Peace
and Reintegration Program decree, and that GIRoA will make a public announcement to that effect this evening (Kabul
time).

We do not yet have a copy of the signed decree (we are working to get a copy for our LES to translate, however, it is not
yet available from any of our sources). Based on previous drafts, we believe the decree will:

   •     Establish the High Peace Council (HPC) called for at the National Consultative Peace Jirga. The HPC will provide
         political and strategic leadership to the Afghan Peace and Reintegration Program (APRP);


    •    Establish the bureaucratic and organizational structure and space for the reintegration Joint Secretariat,
         including appointment of an interim CEO (presumably Stanekzai — although his future long-term tenure in the
         job is unclear).

    •    Provide clear instructions to line ministries to support reintegration and allocate representatives to the Joint
         Secretariat;

    •    Provide clear instructions to sub-national officials to support reintegration and to establish provincial and district
         reintegration committees in accordance with the interim guidance released by the Afghan National Security
         Council in April;

    •    Define a process to absorb Peace through Strength (PTS) and other reintegration structures (potentially
         Disarmament of Illegal Armed Groups — DIAG) under the national and provincial structures of the APRP; and

    •    Most importantly, give the requisite Presidential imprimatur to the program.

A second decree should be issued prior to or concurrent with the Kabul Conference appointing the members of the High
Peace Council and a permanent CEO for the APRP.

As soon as we have a copy of the decree and can confirm its contents, we will send a Front Channel cable; in the
meantime, we are informing the Desk, SRAP and General Petraeus' staff that the decree has been signed.

Regards,

JoAnne
