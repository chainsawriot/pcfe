Subject: Micheletti Stepping Aside

Following is close-hold please.

You will have seen press reports that Micheletti is stepping down â€” reportedly it will be a "leave of absence" for legal
reasons. If this holds, it is an important development that we have been pushing to allow space for Pepe Lobo to get off
to a good start and encourage greater attendance at the Jan 27 inauguration. This was the point of my Jan 5-6 trip to
Tegucigalpa, Hugo's consistent efforts and our follow-up visa revocations. Two nights ago President Martinelli of
Panama called me saying Micheletti wanted to find a way out and would he, Martinelli, talk to me. I spoke with
Martinelli about ten times over the last two days to discuss specifics. Micheletti wanted to depart Friday but I told
Martinelli that it had to be today because regional leaders need time to make their plans. Micheletti wanted assurances
that visas would be restored, but we simply forward to Martinelli our standing press guidance that we continuously
review visa decisions based on the situation on the ground. ck
