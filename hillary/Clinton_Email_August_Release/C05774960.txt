Absolutely. That's what you have a think tank for! On a related note, while it may not be useful for Pakistan, I think we
shd find ways to work qddr briefings/discussions into our strategic dialogues w/ india and china, to talk about how we
are rethinking both diplomacy and development -- maybe also w/ South Africa. AM

Subject: Question

Can you have S/P prepare a comparison of India, Pakistan and Banghladesh over the last 20-30 years on as many factors
reflecting their respective economic and social development as you can muster? I suspect it will prove useful in my
meetings w Pak leaders in ten days.
