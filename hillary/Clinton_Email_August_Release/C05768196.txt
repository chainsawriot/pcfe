Will do. This is such a critical (and frustrating) issue that I want to try and start moving forward on it as soon as we can. I
know Raj wants to address this as well. I'd like to start off with a relatively small group of DoS and USAID reps, plus a
group top private sector brand and other ex erts. For exam .l
                            who is an incredible woman who is already helping me with youth engagement and who would              B6
be terrific for this. In addition I'd like to reach out to people in the NGO and think tank community so we can get a broad
range of opinions.

Will keep you posted.

                                                  There is a difference of opinion within NEA that I am trying to sort out        B5
but I will have something to you by next early week.

Finally, as I think you know,

                                                                                                                                  B5
                        I am working on a memo for you and Jim outlining the details.

Subject: recognition of USG assistance/contributions.

We all agree that there is a need to dramatically increase the awareness level of USG assistance efforts around the
world. Following up on conversations with Melanne and others, I would like to suggest that we begin the effort by
bringing together a small group of people from inside and outside government to help us think this through. USAID
participation will be crucial. I'd be happy to organize this and/or co-host the event with you. Let me know what you
think.
