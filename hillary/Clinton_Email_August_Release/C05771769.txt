Please Pass to the Secretary

Madame Secretary,

A shoot out occurred on August 20 in front of the American School in Monterrey (AFSM), resulting in the death of two
bodyguards. An investigation is continuing into the details, but our understanding at this point is that it was an attempted
kidnapping targeting the relatives of a local business executive. While it does not appear that U.S. families were targeted,
the sharp increase in kidnapping incidents in the Monterrey area, and this event in particular, present a very high risk to
the families of U.S. citizens who might be become incidental victims.

U.S. security and law enforcement personnel have engaged local and federal security officials to seek their help on
understanding the immediate risks and measures that can be taken. I have urged U.S. families at the Consulate in

Monterrey not to send their children to school in the coming days while we review the events that took place on August
20. We also are advising U.S. citizens in the area that we have urged Consulate personnel not to send their children to
school while we complete this security review.

I am sure that the warden notice will lead to a rash of press reports on U.S. concerns about security in Monterrey. More
broadly, if the government cannot get the kidnappings in Monterrey under control, that may affect our ability to function in
Monterrey. I have advised Secretary Espinosa of this, and have sought her help as well to address consulate security.

Consulate personnel are currently on "authorized departure" and have the option to send their families to a U.S.
location. Pat Kennedy is in close touch on these matters.

Carlos Pascual
