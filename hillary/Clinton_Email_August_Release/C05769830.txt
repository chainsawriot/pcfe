Dan,
Wanted to bring this to your attention. Gov. Bill Richardson called the taskforce today to inquiring about travel to
Haiti. His specific concerns were:
    O An update on the court proceedings of the missionaries, particularly whether or not a Haitian court decision is
         imminent;
    O Information on whether or not he could travel to Haiti and how to set up a trip;
    O Information on whether or not he could travel by private plane;
    O A list of what supplies are needed in Haiti; and
    O Direction on how to deliver those supplies.

He said he may not travel if he receives an indication that the case of the Amcit missionaries would be decided
sometime in the next few days.

H has been informed. Please let us know if you would like us to forward to C or M.

Governor Richardson understood that a Haitian court would decide the missionaries' case on February 10 and said there
was some speculation that the missionaries would be released. If they are not going to be released, then Governor
Richardson is considering traveling to Haiti to inquire about the status of the missionaries, deliver needed supplies to
Haitians, and meet with President Preval                                               Governor Richardson emphasized
that the trip plans could be eliminated if he received some indication that the case would be decided sometime in the
next few days.

Governor Richardson specifically requested:
   • An update on the court proceedings of the missionaries, particularly whether or not a Haitian court decision is
       imminent;
   • Information on whether or not he could travel to Haiti and how to set up a trip;
    •    Information on whether or not he could travel by private plane;
    •    A list of what supplies are needed in Haiti; and
    •    Direction on how to deliver those supplies.
