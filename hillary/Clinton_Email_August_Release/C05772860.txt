Here is my quick take on the results -- see below. It's 1994 all over again -- that's for sure. Brilliant of you to be
thousands of miles away from this.




           No Tea Party for the Tea Party

           But Obama must heed the message of exit polls

        By Mark Penn

         Without doubt the tea Party will be rejoicing at the results and laying down ultimatums to the Republican Party
to steer to the right, and the Republican Party having embraced the Tea party will be hard pressed to say "no" to the
new right wing in America.

        Poll after poll shows that the Tea Party is really a splinter of the Republican Party, and the exit polls show that
this was a vote about the economy, not ideology. Only 23% of the voters said that they were casting a vote for the Tea
Party while 56% said it was not a factor and the rest outright opposed them.

        But 62% of the voters said that the economy was the key factor determining their vote. The polls show that the
voters want tax cuts not tax increases, modification or repeal of healthcare, spending cuts and above all jobs.

        With healthcare reform, cap and trade bills, and tax increases, President Obama got out of step with the voters.
Why he didn't just kick the Bush tax cuts down the road a year and get them out of the election cycle is mystifying.
Instead -- just like in 1994 -- the Democrats ran on the platform of increasing taxes for the wealthy, amplifying class
warfare rather than ending it.

         Whoever told President Obama "don't worry, just pass healthcare and they will love it" must be squirming in his
seat tonight. And all those who think that tacking further to the left is the answer for the Democrats should look at these
results carefully and think again.

        President Obama and the Democrats lost many of the new constituencies they had won in 2008 -- they lost
independents by 15 per cent in the CNN exit poll. Obama had won them by 8 points. They lost seniors by 16 points,
doubling the loss from 8 points while seniors turned out in droves. And they lost voters in households making over
$100,000 by 16 points, compared to an even split in 2008, evidence of the damage of the reinvigorated class warfare
strategy. These are all battleground voting blocks that Obama had done well enough with to trounce McCain.

        And the two other core constituencies of President Obama -- young voters and minorities -- stayed home, with
their percentage of the vote dropping dramatically. In the end the Republicans and the Tea Party won the turnout war
and those differences are also a major factor in the outcome. 41% of the voters were conservative, up from 34% in the
2008 presidential election. Only 11% of the voters were aged 18 to 29 compared to 18% in the presidential election.

        These results are just plain facts, and the President needs to stand up and take notice. The voters are rejecting
the current course and have thrown up a major roadblock to his policies.

         But this does not mean that the voters want to gut Medicare, Medicaid, Education or the Environment. They
don't want the government shut down; they want it fully open for business. Above all, they want jobs, and they are
willing to vote for any party they believe may have the answer to the presidential election. Nancy Pelosi became the
poster child of the left and became the target of the Republican right. They scored a bulls eye on her, but all glory is
fleeting. The burden will be on the Republicans now to be a responsible handbrake -- if they again shut down the
government they will lose the public's trust and support very quickly.

        If President Obama wants to serve a second term, he will have to heed the call to recalibrate his administration.
He was elected as a centrist. They want him to be one. He was elected as a youthful, vigorous candidate who would
lead us into a more global future. They want him to do just that. He was elected to end, not amplify partisanship.
President Clinton turned his White House around from a similar defeat in 1994. President Obama faces the same
choices and opportunities to remain true to democratic values and yet set a new direction to turn all this around.
