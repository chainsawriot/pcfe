NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India aims to test a new nuclear-capable missile with a range of more than 5000-km (3,100-
miles), a top military scientist said, a move that could complicate security in a volatile region. "Agni-V is out of the
drawing board. We are aiming for a flight trial within a year," V.K. Saraswat, India's chief military scientist told reporters.
