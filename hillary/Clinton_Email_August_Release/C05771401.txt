PARIS (Reuters) - An Iranian woman accused of adultery will not be executed November 3, France's foreign minister said,
citing a telephone conversation with his Iranian counterpart. "Manouchehr Mottaki assured me that Iranian legal
authorities had not yet reached a verdict in the affair relating to (Ashtiani) and that the information regarding her
alleged execution did not correspond to reality," Bernard Kouchner said in a statement.
