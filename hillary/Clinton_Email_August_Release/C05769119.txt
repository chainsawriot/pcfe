    I read Secretary Clinton's very nice 22 March statement about                          The Secretary's remarks were just
    right. I am certain that Cal and the children greatly appreciated them.

    No need to respond. You guys are busy enough.

    John

    Dear Ms. Mills:

    It may be inappropriate for me to do this and if so I apologize in advance but I thought Secretary Clinton might want to
    know, and probably didn't, about                         terminal illness. My understanding is that the Clintons' and
                paths crossed in Arkansas politics in the past and in a friendly way.

I know all of this because I am originally from Little Rock, and have been told of                turn for the worse by a    B6
friend who teaches at UALR and knows                     Additionally,                                     who served in
the state legislature for a decade or so, was my un ergraduate advisor at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock in the
1960s.

I am emailing you in your capacity as the Secretary's chief of staff.

Again, my apologies if this is something I shouldn't have done.

Sincerely,

John M. Carland
Senior Historian
Office of the Historian
Department of State
