SANTIAGO (Reuters) â€”Thirty-three miners trapped underground for more than two weeks after a cave-in have been
located and tied a message to a drill saying they are all alive, a member of the rescue mission told state
television. "There was a note that said there are 33 workers alive down here," said the rescue worker, who was not
identified.
