  I'll get you a list - but those were first year totals so by now it might have evened out.

  I actually read the Monitor piece and thought it was on balance quite good. So thanks for all your work to get it done.
  But, what I can't figure out is which countries Madeleine and Condi went to that I didn't? Will you pls enlighten me?
