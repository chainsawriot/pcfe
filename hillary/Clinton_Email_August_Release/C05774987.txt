Kris,
Background      All this separate from Simon's broader system(s) potential. Jim (James F.)Blom is Dave's former business
partner in Alacrity Homeland Group. Lives in San Francisco w/ wife and 2 kids. American, but well healed due to long
family history in Norwegian shipping companies. Grandfather was pals with Onassis. You get the picture. Has tight
linkage in supply chain & IT space(s). Deals in countries like you and I dealt with counties / states. Brilliant, resourceful.
Not prone to hyperbole, says he can bring the 'best in the world' to this effort Based on track record , I believe him. For
example, CdeBaca recently met with social networking folks in Silicon Valley. Not sure how that went, but Jim is close
friends with the guy who handles 'Facebook's' finances and said he can get his attention 'in one phone call'. Social
networking piece helpful, but probably a more aggressive 'identify, track, snag, deal with' traffickers required. Method(s)
& prioritization necessary. Let's look into. Spoke w/ Jim about CdeBaca connect. We're in. Best, Marty

contacts. Apart from the ongoing vetting of Simon Stringer's multi purpose software, at several levels, I am keen to help
in the human trafficking effort. I have been in touch with Sharyn Magarian (keeping Kris B informed) in seeking the
status of that effort, as I am quite sure the combo of Dave's former contacts and mine can help. Jim Blom has already

spoken to several (Oracle Corp and his friends in Silicon Valley) and they too are motivated. Work is work, but the
human trafficking issue seems like the right thing to do. All the best, Marty
