The way you are coming across couldn't be better.
Hillary Clinton sends strong message to world


SF Chronicle Editorial Friday, September 10, 2010


Hillary Clinton's blend of diligence, caution and toughness didn't always serve her well as a presidential candidate. But
these attributes make her a powerful secretary of state, the unsung hero for a White House team trying to mend global
fences without looking weak.


In a speech this week, Clinton laid down the law for an audience wondering where Obama is headed on foreign policy.
Would she favor hand-holding with rivals such as China and Russia, a sign that Washington was ducking trouble in the
name of consensus building?


Not at all, suggested Clinton in a lengthy speech to the Council of Foreign Relations. In her diplomatic travels, she found
a hunger for U.S. leadership, and she wants everyone to know it. "The U.S. can, must and will lead in this century," she
said. The "complexities of this world" mean there's an opening for "a new American moment, a moment when our
global leadership is essential."


Her message of strength and obligation may make Obama truehearts swoon. Clinton's thoughts also come at the start of
an election season when President Obama will be knocked for failures overseas along with the economy.


But it's also vintage Clinton. From her days on the Senate's Armed Services Committee, she was always a proponent of
military muscle and a tough regard for American foes. She and Defense Secretary Robert Gates, another hawkish voice,
are running the Obama foreign policy store.


Diplomatic speeches, even one as striking as Clinton's, are a dime a dozen. Clinton's challenge will be delivering on any
of the disputes facing her. There's a long line: a truculent North Korea, new Mideast talks, a rising China, a defiant Iran,
and a half dozen lesser conflicts ranging from African civil wars to drug gangs in Mexico.

There is newness and complication in her outlook, she indicated. Her job is essentially a permanent road trip, meaning
success will hinge on "shoe-leather diplomacy," the steady attention that the wonky, workaholic Clinton believes is
needed for any breakthrough. The Israeli-Palestinian talks, which begin again next week with her at the center, are a
chance for her patience and force to pay off. On Iran, she believes that ever-tightening sanctions accepted by a larger
group of nations will eventually pay off.

Her remarks come with other conditions. A soaring national debt and recession worries preoccupy the White House. The
nation's global reach is bounded by financial limits. Her robust views about American might could easily fade next to
more pressing domestic worries. Also, no matter how thoughtful or acute her remarks, there will always be detractors
who think she's angling for the top job in the White House.

Clinton's doctrine adds urgency in settling affairs on a crowded world stage. Washington has a special duty to lead, a
role that much of the world appreciates. It's time to accept that role, not shy away from it because of political risk or
recent history.
