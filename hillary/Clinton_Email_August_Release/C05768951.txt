Madam Secretary -

One of our Mexican staff and the husbands of two Mexican employees were killed last night in Juarez.

In one case a Mexican employee and her husband were leaving a party hosted by another Mexican employee. They were
in separate vehicles. He was stopped by a hit squad and killed before her.

In a second case a Mexican employee and her husband were killed leaving the same party. Their 3 month-old baby was
left alive in the back seat.

We have activated all investigative and intelligence channels to learn all we can. The head of Mexico's intelligence
service called to express President Calderon's condolences and to offer any support we need. Patricia Espinosa is aware.
She may call you. We will let you know if there are any leads on why this tragedy occurred.

Carlos Pascual
