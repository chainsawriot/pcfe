I'll talk to Dennis at 9:30am tomorrow.

I'd be willing to talk by phone w Bill Burns either by phone over the weekend or on Monday whichever he wants.

And I will decide tomorrow about what, if any, of the foreign calls I'll make.

I'm supposed to get faxed to me tonight a letter for Netanyahu from the specials. Can you find out when it's coming?

I hope you were convincing           and am happy Jen is doing well.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah has been told by doctors he had to rest because he had a slipped disc,
the state-news agency SPA reported on November 12. SPA quoted a royal court statement as saying doctors had
ordered the king, who is in his 80s, to rest under a treatment plan.
