 Subject: Problem: Bustan Plan

The Jerusalem city council is set to review the Kings Garden/Gan Hamelech/Bustan plan tomorrow. Recall that the plan
received approval by a municipal sub committee in late June. The entire city council must now review and approve the
plan because of an administrative appeal filed against it by a Meretz city council member (this appeal process requires
that the entire city council review the plan at some point.) Lots of other details here that Jerusalem will be including in a
front channel cable. Amanda Pilz, CCed here, drafted.

Bottom line though is that (1) this is on the agenda at the explicit direction of the Mayor and deputy mayor and (2)
there is no statutory or other need for this review tomorrow.

Also note that this is not the final step in the process. After full Jerusalem municipal approval the plan must go to
Ministry of Interior bodies. So there is a whole lot of theater involved in this.

 Lastly, recall that the Gan Hamelech plan involves extensive demolitions and the redevelopment of Bustan, a section of
 the Silwan which is a stone throw away from the Old City. (When S made her comments on demolition in November
 2009 she was referring to Bustan demolitions)




 Best,
 Alon
