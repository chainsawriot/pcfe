Subject: FW: FINAL 01-13-10 Haiti Talking Points - 0530
Importance: High


There weren't a huge number of updates over the evening, though the phones are getting more active again now. Late
this morning we learned that SYG Ban Ki Moon was in touch with AMB Rice, and told her that there were approximately
100 UN staff still buried under the rubble at MINUSTAH,                              SYG Ban formally requested
helicopter search and rescue teams. AMB Rice underscored that we need to make getting those SARs a priority.


I'm attaching our draft talking points from about an hour and a half ago; the background sections in particular have
some useful information. Currently, Southcom is conducting aerial reconnaissance of the airport to determine in what
sort of repair it is. The talking points note that several countries and organizations (Dominican Republic, Chile, UK, the
Netherlands, IADB) have offered assistance to Haiti (and info'd us). In addition to those on the list, the Israelis are trying
to send several urban search and rescue teams (some of the team members need help getting visas to transit Miami en
route to Port-au-Prince).


The UN Situation Center is in contact with MINUSTAH's Deputy Force Commander. They have been working to clear a
couple of major streets in Port-au-Prince, as noted in the talking points. They have also reviewed the airport, and their
Deputy Force Commander told the UN Situation Center several hours ago that the airport was functional (in the sense
that the tarmac was intact and planes could physically land).


Oren Anolik, political counselor at the Israeli Embassy, called around 2 a.m. to ask if there were any updates. We had
few updates at that time, other than to let him know that we had learned the damage to southern Haiti was much more
extensive than that in the north.
