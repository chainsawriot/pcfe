Joe -

Just wanted to give you a heads-up that former Secretary Rice will be traveling to the UAE and Saudi Arabia
December 11-14. This is purely a business trip, as you can expect she may conduct courtesy calls with
government officials. The desk and Posts have been notified as a courtesy. I have direct contact with the RSOs
as a contingency. Security and Transportation, at their insistence, are being provided by the host countries.

Hope all is well.

Best,
Colby
