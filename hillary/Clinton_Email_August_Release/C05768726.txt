The word from Ramallah is quite positive. IF there are no announcements this week, we anticipate that the Arab League
Follow-up Committee will give its blessing on May 1 and Sen Mitchell can return to the region to start talking substance.
Given the Israelis' warning, this is a real If.

Karl/Frank will go in today to walk Karzai through the particulars of the visit - the only thorny part is that it has dropped
from 4 to 3 days. But it has all the same elements, plus a dinner with Biden.

Did you see reports that Iran has dropped out of the running for the UNSC? Trying to confirm.

Andrew S. will be sending you a long memo that responds to DOD's pooling proposals - it conveys a desire to work
together with DOD on this and offers some alternative ideas. He also canvassed the building on other topics and will
send a list up for your book tonight. He and I agreed that the list should just be for reference and that your approach of
having informal conversation on the big topics is the right one.

You saw CDM's email about the Sudan ad. Ben emailed yesterday to say he wants to talk Sudan comms strategy going
forward. Hopefully I'll reach him today. I know CDM is talking to Denis.
