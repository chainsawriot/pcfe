UNDP UPDATE ON THE EARTHQUAKE IN HAITI

Casualties and damage from the earthquake are so extensive that overall assessments are still incomplete. UN
assistance to the victims has been complicated by the fact that a significant number of UN personnel, including
UNDP colleagues, serving in the country are unaccounted for. The headquarters of the UN Mission and
peacekeeping operations, MINUSTAH, collapsed in the tremors and many people are still trapped inside.

UNDP Administrator Helen Clark is meeting with the Secretary-General and other senior personnel continually
today and the whole UN system is mobilized to bring the UN team in Haiti all necessary assistance as soon as
possible to assess the damage, loss of life and injuries, and to support the national and international response
efforts.

The building which housed UNDP and a large number of sister agencies - UNFPA, WFP, UNEP and UNIFEM
- was partially damaged, and rescue workers are continuing to search through the rubble. Senior UNDP officials
are in close touch with the Resident Co-ordinator, Kim Bolduc, who is operating out of a MlNUSTAH logistics
base near the airport. She reports that the situation is critical for staff with limited access to food, water,
sanitation and medical attention.

In the coming hours UNDP will be dispatching additional staff, including stress counselors and medical doctors,
as well communications equipment, to Port-au-Prince. Arrangements are also being made to evacuate injured
and non-essential staff out from the country and to care for and assist its many local staff members. Due to the
limited logistics capacity in Haiti, most of the staff and equipment needed will be transiting through the
Dominican Republic. Plans for strengthening the UNDP office in that country are already underway.

Administrator Clark says UNDP will do whatever it can to support its staff in Haiti and to equip them with the
necessary tools to help the Haitian people on what will be a long road to recovery. As a first step she expects a
UN emergency response team lead by UN Office of the Coordinator for Humanitarian Assistance (OCHA) to be
on the ground shortly to help co-ordinate humanitarian relief efforts.
