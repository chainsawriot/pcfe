Subject: (Reuters) Netanyahu seeks loyalty oath to Jewish nation-state

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will push for legislation to require those wanting to become
Israeli citizens to pledge loyalty to the "nation-state of the Jewish people." Under Israeli law, Jews wanting to immigrate
to Israel are granted automatic citizenship and non-Jews have to take a loyalty oath to the "state of Israel".

The amendment would win favor with one of Netanyahu's key coalition partners, Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman,
who leads the right-wing Israel our Home party. Lieberman has advocated a loyalty oath to the Jewish state for all
Israelis, including Arab citizens who make up some 20 percent of the population.
