We've been in touch with Ambassador Susan Jacobs--she is on the road now, but I understand that she did speak with
Mr. Bower earlier today. We are keeping her posted on all of these developments.

Someone is apparently providing the Bower family with misinformed "readouts" of both the Secretary's meeting with
President Mubarak last week and Senator Kerry's phone call with President Mubarak yesterday (Friday)--and these
"readouts" do not/not conform with what we understand actually took place. We do not know the source of this
misinformation. When our officers have tried to explain the state of play, the family cite other unspecified sources
telling them that the boys will be released.

I intend to see Mr. Bower when he is here either tomorrow or Monday and hope to get us back onto the same page.

We need our ambassador for children to reach out to him and share that guidance b/c S is getting pulled into this
instead of it remaining at the level of folks with operational knowledge.

Janice - who is our new children's ambassador - I would welcome them coordinating with Margaret and then also
reaching out to Howard Dean, John Kerry and other political figures who are calling S about this matter.

There is no/no indication that the GOE intends to intervene in the judicial process which has yet to fully hear Mr.
Bower's legal challenge to his wife's Egyptian custody order. As I read the read-out of Sen Kerry call to President
Mubarak (forwarded in separate email), Mubarak said he could not intervene in the judicial process.

The next hearing is set for October.

                    A meeting on Sept 20th has been set for Mr. Bowers, the Egyptian "Good Intentions Committee"
which is an extra-judicial group of officials who try to facilitate resolution of custody cases involving foreign parents (but
the committee has no authority to order the children's return to Mr. Bowers), and the ex-wife, and possibly the children.

We have been urging the GOE to assure that the boys are available to see their father on the 20th. We do not expect
that the boys will be released to him and do not understand how the family came to believe this.

We understand that Mr. Bower still plans to travel for meeting on the 20th with Egyptian officials and ex-wife and
possibly see his sons--that's what we are pressing for.

This is the custody case Dean emailed you about and John Kerry called me to discuss. I personally gave a letter to
Mubarak and asked that the children be returned to their father in the US, or, at the least, be given court ordered visits.
I don't know what, if anything, then happened.


I'm copying Jeff Feltman on this and asking him to have someone follow up w Dean and Kerry and to let us both know
what's happening.


Thx, Jeff and let me know if there is anything more I need to do. HRC

Apparently Secretary Clinton got Mubarak's agreement to release the boys. The father is headed to Cairo on Monday to
pick them up at the embassy. Staff at the embassy and at the State Dept is now saying that this is only a visitation. As
you can imagine the family is really upset and the supporters are livid. They are expecting that Colin will be headed back
to the states with the boys Tuesday. The press wants to know what is going on. Any advice here, because I have no idea
what is going on? Many thanks to you and esp to Hillary for getting us this far. Howard
