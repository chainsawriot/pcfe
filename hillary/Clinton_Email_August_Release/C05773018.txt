Subject:                          RE: Cookstoves



We spoke to the Norway's Ambassador to the UN and they are joining the Alliance for Clean Cookstoves for $600,000
the first year. They noted that this is a down payment and would contribute a "substantial amount for this endeavor" in
the future. They wanted to move quickly for the CGI announcement and ant to see a business plan before they commit
more.

Thnx for making this important call. Other countries including France and Finland were waiting for the Norway signal.
