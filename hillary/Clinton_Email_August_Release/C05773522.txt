Cheryl,

I had a good conversation with Bob this afternoon. The major points he wanted to emphasize were the ones he had
included in his emails to you, including:

         "Rebalancing" Haitian development: Redevelopment should occur nationwide and encourage a more even
distribution of the Haitian population. The international community should not rebuild Port-au-Prince at the expense of
the rest of the country. Bob thinks that nationwide rebuilding will also reduce the chances of elite capture of the
rebuilding effort, since elites are strongly concentrated in Port-au-Prince.

•       Transparency: Bob is cautious about just throwing money at the problem. He thinks the international
community should establish a new norm of transparency in Haiti, for example, to ensure that there isn't widespread
corruption, price gauging, grants of monopolies, etc.

•         Link the Haitian business community to other business communities: Bob thinks that if all the rebuilding is done
by the usual suspects in the Haitian business community, they'll simply build back the country they had before. He
recommends working to bring in foreign investors, and then linking foreign investors and leading Haitian businessmen
(e.g., in a business roundtable) to socialize better business practices in Haiti.

•       On the issue of legal authorities for reconstruction: Bob recommends exploring whether presidential
commission-like structures could be empowered to resolve the legal problems likely to arise as barriers to
reconstruction.

•      Duration of US presence: Bob cautioned that most Haitians would be happy to see a long-term US military
presence in the country, though this would likely have adverse reputational consequences in the hemisphere for the
United States. Given that hurricane season will begin in the fall, Bob recommends that when we do draw down, we
make clear that we will return if needed.

•       Getting people to work: Bob argued that NGOs may not be the best vehicles for getting Haitians to work (e.g.,
through job training, etc.). In short, they're too nice. Many Haitians have never held a regular job, are unfamiliar with
showing up on time, etc. They'll need a bit of tough love and discipline. Bob though ex-military might set the right kind
of example.

•       Diaspora: Engaging the diaspora is clearly important, but we do not want to support widespread repatriation of
the diaspora as NGO employees, reconstruction experts, etc., at the expense of Haitians who never left. This reinforces
wage differentials and social discontent about returnees.

•       Conditional cash transfers: Bob thinks that conditional cash transfer programs have a lot of potential to improve
education and the delivery of health services in Haiti.
