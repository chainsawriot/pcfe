Subject: Call To Bongo on Iran Postponed by a Day

Jake: FYI: President Bongo was reportedly tied up in a marathon cabinet meeting today following his return from Nice,
and could not speak with me as arranged. My call to Bongo has been rescheduled for Friday morning. I will provide you
with feedback after I connect with him. Regards, Johnnie
