 you are going to be in estoniaand as you know we talked about israel for this trip as well potentially (although maybe we
 are never going there....).
 ii told zach becfore they scheduled to do it earlier in the week if they really wanted you to be able to come.
 he said they couldnt and you and i discussed getting the dvd for you.
 i did tell cvc as well that moving party from the april 10th date to the 24th would make it difficult for you to go. unless
 you want us to make the schedule work somehow.
