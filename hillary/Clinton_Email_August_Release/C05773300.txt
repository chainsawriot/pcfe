Ma'am,

Thank you so much for your support for this project and for how quickly you made it move. Please convey our thanks to
the Secretary for her leadership on this issue. It has truly touched our members. As you may have seen, it received wide
attention within LGBT media, youth media (MTV and VH1), and the wider media. The video has over 110,000 views on
youtube already, and she is likely to touch many more people as it spreads.

Many thanks,

Jon

Jon Tollefson
