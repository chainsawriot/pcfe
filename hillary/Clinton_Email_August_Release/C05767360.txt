BELFAST (Reuters) - A car bomb exploded outside a courthouse in the Northern Ireland border town of Newry on
Monday, police said, in the latest of increasingly frequent attacks in the province. Police were in the process of
evacuating people from the area when there was a large explosion in a car which left the vehicle ablaze close to the
courthouse gates, a spokeswoman for the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said.
