More than a million spectators gathered before the Capitol on a frosty January

afternoon to witness the inauguration of Barack Obama, who promised in his

campaign to change Washington's mercenary culture of lobbyists, special interest

influence and backroom deals. But within a few months of being sworn in, the

President and his top aides were sitting down with leaders from the

pharmaceutical industry to hash out a deal that they thought would make health

care reform possible.

Over the following months, pharmaceutical industry lobbyists and executives met

with top White House aides dozens of times to hammer out a deal that would

secure industry support for the administration's health care reform agenda in

exchange for the White House abandoning key elements of the president's promises

to reform the pharmaceutical industry. They flooded Congress with campaign

contributions, and hired dozens of former Capitol Hill insiders to push their

case. How they did it--pieced together from news accounts, disclosure forms

including lobbying reports and Federal Election Commission records, White House

ingrained the grip of special interests remains in Washington.



In the 2008 campaign, Obama declared his intention to include all stakeholders

as he sought to reform the nation's health care system, but also supported key

Democratic health reform policies
<ht_tp://www.barackobama.ccm/2007/06/1 6/obama says drus4         plan could sav.php>

. Among these were several that targeted the pharmaceutical industry: Allowing

re-importation of drugs from first world countries with lower drug prices and

providing Medicare with negotiating authority over prescription drug prices in

the recently enacted Part D program. These weren't just promises, Obama had

already voted for both of them as a senator in 2007. (Roll Call Vote 132

Set to carry out this agenda were two Capitol Hill veterans, schooled in the

. Emanuel was a former fundraiser, Clinton administration official, investment

banker and member of the Democratic leadership in Congress. Messina was the

former campaign manager and chief of staff to the powerful Senate Finance

Committee chairman Max Baucus. Both were known for their unparalleled

legislative abilities.

Because of Obama's decision to develop a plan operating through the legislative

process, members of Congress also played key roles. Early on, the pharmaceutical

companies were told to deal directly with Senate Finance Committee chairman Max

Baucus <http.://www.nytim.es.com/2009/08/06/health/poiicy/06insure.html> . Baucus

would be the vehicle for the deal worked out behind the scenes by the White

House and PhRMA.

Central to this effort was PhRMA president, CEO and top lobbyist Billy Tauzin, a

longtime Democratic member of Congress who switched party affiliations after

Republicans gained control of Congress in 1994. By switching parties Tauzin was

able to maintain his influence and even rose to be Chairman of the House

Committee on Energy & Commerce. Tauzin became the poster child of Washington's

mercenary culture. He crafted a bill to provide prescription drug access to

Medicare recipients, one that provided major concessions to the pharmaceutical

industry. Medicare would not be able to negotiate for lower prescription drug

costs and reimportation of drugs from first world countries would not be

allowed. A few months after the bill passed, Tauzin announced that he was

retiring- from Congress and would be taking a job helming PhRMA for a salary of

$2 million.

Tauzin's job change became fodder for a campaign ad that then presidential

candidate Barack Obama ran in the spring of 2008 simply titled "Billy

<htto:J/www.joutdbe. Tii,arcl-,?v-NCRpOg9CfA> ." It featured the candidate,

sleeves rolled up, talking to a salon of gasping Americans about the ways of

Washington. "The pharmaceutical industry wrote into the prescription drug plan

that Medicare could not negotiate with drug. companies. And you know what, the

chairman of the committee, who pushed the law through, went to work for the

pharmaceutical industry making $2 million a year." The screen fades to black to

Inform the viewer that, "Barack Obama is the only candidate who refuses

Washington lobbyist money," while the candidate continues his lecture, "Imagine

that. That's an example of the same old game playing in Washington. You know, I

don't want to learn how to play the game better, I want to put an end to the

game playing."

Aiding PhRMA in their outreach to Congress would be a squadron of lobbyists to

push their health care reform priorities. Over the course of 2009, the drug

industry trade group spent over $28 million
<1- 7,2://,;

on in house and hired lobbyists. Aside from PhRMA's massive in-house lobbying



   UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767167 Date: 08/31/2015
         UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767167 Date: 08/31/2015




operation, the trade group hired 48 outside lobbying firms. The total number of

lobbyists working for PhRMA in 2009 reached 165. Some 137 of those 165 lobbyists

representing PhRMA were former employees of either the legislative or executive

branches. Of these dozens were former congressional staffers including two

former chiefs of staff to Max Baucus.

According to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, drug makers

contributed huge sums to congressional campaign committees
<http://www.opensecrets.orgLindustries/indus.ohp?ind=H04>

during the same period--from January to the end of October (4th quarter numbers

are still being totaled), industry political action committees, employees and

their family members flooded lawmakers with over $8 million. Those contributions

tilted heavily to Democrats over Republicans by a 57 to 42 percent margin--the

first time in any election cycle going back to 1990, the first year that the

Center for Responsive Politics began tracking industry giving, that Democrats

were so favored. Given their majorities on Capitol Hill, and the new President's

intention to reform America's health care system, the new tilt was perhaps not

surprising.

On March 5, the White House held a meeting with major health care industry

leaders <http://www.pbs.org/newsouridodates/health/jan-june09/healthcare_03:105 â€žhtml>

to try to bring them to the table and see what could be done to gain their

support. In attendance were Billy Tauzin, oresident, CEO and top lobbyist for

PhRMA, Pfizer CEO Jeff Kindler, America's Health Care Plans (AHIP) Chairman

Karen Ignani, Tom Donohue of the Chamber of Commerce and Robert Wood Johnson

Foundations' Rise Lavizzomourey. A day before the White House meeting Tauzin

by this apparent change of heart on behalf of an industry long adverse to health

care reforms.

On April 15, Jim Messina and Jon Selib, chief of staff to Senate Finance

Committee chairman Max Baucus, convened a meeting at the headquarters of the

Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) with leaders of organized labor

and health care groups, including PhRMA. At the meeting, the groups decided to

form two nonprofit entities to promote reform efforts, Healthy Economy Now and

Americans for Stable Quality Care, that would be almost entirely funded by PhRMA

<http://www.politico.com/news/storaes/l009/28362.html> . The two groups spent

$24 million on their advertising campaigns; the contract to produce and place

ads went to White House Senior Advisor David Axelrod's former firm

<hrt:t_p ://wy,T.p.b_LI   .co.cominews/stories 809/26240        , AKPD, which owed

Axelrod $2 million.

In the next month, CEO's from pharmaceutical companies would meet with Baucus

and administration officials at least four times. These talks preceded a major

public event at the White House, one critical to its strategy to promote health

care reform. On May 11, PhRMA and other trade industry groups pledged cost

cutting measures

to the White House that would save, they claimed, upwards of $2 trillion over

the next decade. President Obama announced the deal in the State Dining Room,

flanked by leaders of the various trade groups; the administration followed up

with a media blitz in the press and on the White House Web site

<http://www.whitehouse.govibloq/Coming-Togethe: rinQing-Down-Costs/> .

The next day, Healthy Economy Now's PhRMA funded ad campaign ran their first

advertisement <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KuoAV6vt0> in support of the

health care reform process calling for the government to finally "fix" the

nation's health care cost problems. While many elements of the $2 trillion cost

cutting pledge fell apart, the drug industry remained committed to the process

in the hopes that they could ultimately win out and defeat the provisions they

most feared in closed-door meetings with the White House.

The first occurred on June 2. White House visitor logs show PhRMA's top

executives, including Tauzin, and industry CEOs met with Sarah Fenn from the

White House Office of Health Care Reform. On the same day, the publicly

available schedule of Senator Max Baucus shows Tauzin and the same industry CEOs

met the Senate Finance Committee chairman. What ultimately resulted from these

coordinated meetings would be revealed by Baucus on June 20.

In a press release <htt//fil,ance.-enate.ov/oress/3eress/2009press4;rb062009_,pdf>

featuring a statement by Tauzin, Baucus revealed that the pharmaceutical

industry had accepted $80 billion in cost cutting measures to be included in the

Senate Finance Committee version of the bill. According to news reports

<http://dyn.polit co.com/p.:rint tony.cfm?uuid-BDi8F267-18FE-70P2-A8P 9b 0?6D2,27DF>

, Baucus initially proposed $100 billion in cost cutting measures, but the

executives and lobbyists meeting on June 2 were able to win the lower figure.

The terms of the initial cost-cutting deal included $30 billion go directly

towards closing the "donut hole" in Medicare prescription drug coverage. The

"donut hole" is a term for the gap in coverage that occurs within the Medicare

prescription drug coverage. For those purchasing prescription drugs through the

Medicare program coverage cuts off at $2,700 spent and does not pick back up

again until $6,154 is spent by the participant. The amount proposed in the deal,

50 percent coverage for drugs within the coverage gap, however, would not

completely close the "donut hole."

In Baucus' press release, Tauzin is quoted as saying, "This is a

once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and, working together, we can make this hope for

a better tomorrow a reality today." This "once-in-a-lifetime" opportunity also

extended to the pharmaceutical industry's ability to blunt the long-term

Democratic agenda of lowering prescription drug prices through Medicare

negotiations, re-importation and quicker release of generics onto the market.

After making such a grand statement of support through cost cutting proposals it

was time for the pharmaceutical industry to finally force the White House and



   UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767167 Date: 08/31/2015

Democrats to take certain chips off the table.

Baucus proceeded with a plan to convene a bipartisan group
<htt--//www nvtimes.com/2009/07/28/us/or,litics/28baucus.html>

in an effort to craft the bill desired by the White House. These participants

included Democrats Kent Conrad and Jeff Bingaman and Republicans Chuck Grassley,

Mike Enzi and Olympia Snowe. Baucus' decision and the need to solidify deals

with groups like the pharmaceutical industry - which were reliant on Baucus

producing a bill - slowed down the legislative process making it impossible for

Congress to meet the White House's announced August recess deadline

<http://www.huffinotonpostzcom/2009L07/2/ bama-defends-auoust-dead n 241755.html>

for passing health care reform.

Soon after, PhRMA's big guns and industry lobbyists paid the White House another

visit on July 7 and this time met with Rahm Emanuel and Jim Messina (Baucus'

chief of staff Jon Selib is also listed in White House visitor logs for this

meeting). In August, The Huffington Post's
<http://www.huffingtonpostcom/2009/08/13/intelnaL-memo-confirms-bi n 258285.html>

Ryan Grim reported on an internal memo that was drafted at that meeting that

outlined the policies that would not be allowed into any final version of health

'care reform. These included Medicare prescription drug negotiations, drug

re-importation, and the lowering of prices for drugs available through Medicare

Part D and Part B. The deal would be $eo billion in cost cutting and absolutely

no more.

***



While the $80 billion deal was cut with Baucus' committee, other congressional

committees continued to mark-up their own versions of health care reform without

the knowledge that the White House was relying on Baucus to produce the final

product. In the House of Representatives, the House Energy & Commerce Committee

leveled a direct threat to the $80 billion deal. Energy & Commerce Chair Henry

Waxman sought to include all of the provisions that PhRMA had gotten the White

House and Baucus to cut out of the reform bill. These included drug

reimportation, Medicare negotiating power and speedier release of generics to

the market. According to previous analysis of the measures proposed by the



      UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767167 Date: 08/31/2015
      UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767167 Date: 08/31/2015




committee, these measures would have totaled hundreds of billions in cost cuts,

far exceeding the $80 billion cap agreed to by the White House, Baucus and

PhRMA.

The cost cutting measures passed in the Energy & Commerce bill spooked the board

of PhRMA, which included all of the CEOs involved in the deal-cutting meetings

with the White House and Baucus. The board pressured Tauzin to go public with

the deal to ensure that the White House would recognize it and not renege. On

August 4, the Los Angeles Times <ht:to.:             :es.iatlmes.coa-1/2009,iaug/04 / iaL.Ion/na:
hea.Lthr'arg=-oh--m-4>

, in an exclusive report, featured quotes from Tauzin claiming that a deal

between the White House and PhRMA. existed and that as Tauzin put it, "The White

House blessed it." Tom Hamburger wrote in the article, "For his part, Tauzin

said he had not only received the White House pledge to forswear Medicare drug

price bargaining, but also a separate promise not to pursue another proposal

Obama supported during the campaign: importing cheaper drugs from Canada or

Europe."

The White House's Jim Messina later confirmed Tauzin's claim, stating, "The

president encouraged this approach ... He wanted to bring all the parties to the

table to discuss health insurance reform."

Democratic lawmakers were furious. Rep. Raul Grijalva, chairman of the

Progressive Caucus, asked <Ottp://www_lytimes                09/08/06/ heal        icy/06insure.

, "Are industry groups going to be the ones at the table who get the first big

piece of the pie and we just fight over the crust?"
***

On September 7, Baucus' bill made a private circulation on the Hill;

pharmaceutical industry cost-cutting did not exceed $80 billion. Five days

later, the New York Times <h   ://_prescriptJ_(- s.bloq.utimes.com/20                    'drug-mak ers-

reported that PhRMA planned to spend up to $150 million in an advertising blitz

in support of Baucus' bill. The Times noted that the ad spending "...would be a

follow-up to the deal that drug makers struck in June with Mr. Baucus and the

White House." On September 16, Baucus released the full text of his legislation

<htto://www.huffingtonp2st.com/2009/09/16/health-care-bill-baucus7s .n_288218,hitml>

to the public.

The White House, PhRMA and Baucus still had to fight a few battles to keep the

deal intact. The key amendment targeting the PhRMA deal in committee mark-up

came from Sen. Bill Nelson from Florida, which has one of the largest Medicare

participant populations in the nation. The pull of constituent needs clearly put

Bill Nelson into a position to push for further cost cutting in Medicare

prescription drug pricing. His target: closing the "donut hole" completely.

Nelson claimed that his amendment would generate $106 billion in revenue

<4ttp://www,politioo.comilivepuise/0909Ne:Lson PhRMA amendment_                       , or

from PhRMA's perspective increase their cost-cutting to $186 billion. That would

be unacceptable to PhRMA, to Baucus, to the White House and to the

pharmaceutical industry who had made the deal. Other Senate Democrats, Tom

Carper and Robert Menendez voted with Republicans and Baucus on the committee to

defeat the amendment <htto://ww4.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/sep/24/panel-faH.s=
overturn-white-house-deal-drugmakers/>

. It is little surprise the Carper's Delaware is home to AstraZeneca and

Menendez' New Jersey is home to Merck and Bristol-Myers-Squibb, all â€¢ of which

lobbied for the $80 billion cap.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid introduced the final bill, with the cap in

place, on November 19. Debate began on Dec. 3, and with it come one more attempt

by members to change the terms of the deal. Senator Byron Dorgan introduced an

amendment that would allow for drug re-importation, but as the date for voting

drew near, the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) released a letter

<hti- p://thehiil.com/home-ews/senate/r1307-ida-opRoses-senate-drug-importation-amendmen>

objecting to the proposal that echoed pharmaceutical industry talking points:

 ...as currently written, the resulting structure would be logistically

challenging to implement and resource intensive. In addition, there are

significant safety concerns." Dorgan's amendment was defeated

<http://www.2plitico.com/iivepuise/1209/BREAKING Senate rejects Dorgan amendment.html>

with numerous Democrats previously in support of reimportation switching to "no"

votes.

On Christmas Eve, the bill passed the Senate with the PhRMA deal fully intact.
* * *



New Year's Eve passed with no further action on health care reform. Public

opinion regarding the health care reform bill had been slipping throughout 2009.

It reached a fulcrum in the special election to replace the deceased. senator Ted

Kennedy in Massachusetts on January 19, 2010. Newly minted senator Scott Brown

campaigned that he would be the senator to provide Republicans with the votes to

filibuster the final health care reform bill. Democrats ran for cover. Despite

having the largest majorities of any party since the 1970s, Democrats put the

brakes on their agenda, particularly health care reform.

In the end, the pharmaceutical industry's support for health care reform would

be left up in the air . After spending $100 million in advertising in support of

legislation that Tauzin and key executives hoped would be a windfall for the

pharmaceutical industry, the legislative process had flat-lined. In February,

the board of PhRMA, split over the deal cut by Tauzin, pushed Tauzin to resign

his post <http://thecaucus.blogs.nytime snm/' 13/02,11/healch-.                  7,-in-limbo-top-drug:

, President Obama owed up to failures in the process of passing health care

reform, 'Tribe health care debate as it unfolded legitimately raised concerns

not just among my opponents, but also amongst supporters that we just don't know
