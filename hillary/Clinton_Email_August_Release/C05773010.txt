         Policy Recommendations:

             •    Eliminate exemptions. Fewer than three million of Pakistan's 175 million
                  citizens pay any income tax, and the country's tax-to-GDP ratio is just 9
                  percent. By eliminating tax exemptions for the rich, politicians can fund
                  essential social services.

             •    Increase tax revenue. Pakistani legislators must build a consensus to tax the
                  rich and elite if they want to match growth rates in nearby developing
                  countries.

             •    Spend more on development. Pakistan has spent twice as much on defense
                  during peacetime as it has on education and health combined—this needs to
                  change.

             •    Stop the bailouts. Donor countries must put conditions on funding and
                  should emphasize tax and economic reform to help Pakistan develop long-
                  term economic plans for sustainable growth.

         "Pakistan's lack of a proper tax and revenue regime has resulted in high rates of tax
         evasion, burdening the country with unsustainable debt and undermining its
         development priorities," writes Zaidi. "The key to the country's economic prosperity—
         even its survival—is a far-reaching program of tax reform."
