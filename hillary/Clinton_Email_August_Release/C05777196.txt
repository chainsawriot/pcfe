Dear friends,




I'm so grateful to have had the pleasure of working with you over the past 18 months. Public service is an honor and I
feel so lucky to have had the opportunity to serve our country in both the White House and the State.Department. I'm
deeply impressed by the important work you do and will leave Washington, DC knowing that our country's best days are
ahead of us thanks to your commitment, hard work, and passion.




My last day at the State Department will be July 9th.                                                                    B6
would love to see you before I go â€” please save the date of July 8th for a cupcakes and champagne party in DC.




My personal email is                           Please visit me in                            J




 Best,

 Katie
