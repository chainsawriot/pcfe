Greetings Cheryl.

On reflection, I think this whole situation has become much more complicated than we had first thought, for me as well
as for the Secretary. I would really like to discuss it further with you, tomorrow if you are available. I will be in the BPC
office all day, although I have a conference call I cannot re-schedule between 12:30 and 1:30.
Main number over there is 202/204-2400. Or on cell at                My                                                         B6
                                                                                                                                     I
thanks. Dan
