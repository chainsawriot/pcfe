Subject                            Update



Busy day yesterday - highlights:

- haiti delivered its vision, fine but needs work and cost alignment (3 year cost exceeds 78 with total need put at 11B for
complete rebuild - neither are great numbers based on analysis so work cont)

- discussion and presentation of both dev authority and MDTF (which is open for contributions now and will be
administered by WB with support from IDB)

- bellerive or preval to announce wjc in context of release on dev authority - supposedly today but if preval wants to
announce from Haiti that won't occur until thurs and will drive us all wild so pushing for today

- EC says it will do essentially 100M that is new (rest is 200M being repurposed; 100M - of which 20M is only new - being
repurposed). Of their repurposed money, 40M euros will go to debt support by end of april)

- France will do 70M euros a year for 2 years (upping their traditional annual contrib by SOM euros from 20M euros);
french will do some budget supp

- seeing spain, canada, and pot today

- tentatively seeing cubans today to discuss hospital cooperation proposal they sent as result of craighulissa last trip

- lots of whispering re timing of usg human rts report and a few pointed ques re our motivation on timing given pre-conf
and cont on 31Mar; preval still very upset - will be calling him on thurs as a post conf cony and hear him out

- pressure for budget support on everyone; french pointed out US says it doesnt do budget supp but sends 500M each
year to palestian auth in direct budget support suggesting we will do it when politically expedient for us

- worry about the rains and cont need for shelter (been raining in PauP for last 3 days).
