Hi Cheryl â€” hope you're holding up ok with all of the Haiti work.

I'm having a little reception on 3/22 6pm over at the OAS to celebrate my swearing-in. I'd love it if you could
come by for a glass of champagne and a little jazz music!

I'd love to invite the Secretary. Is that even proper protocol? Although she probably couldn't attend, I'd like to
share it with her. Your thoughts?
