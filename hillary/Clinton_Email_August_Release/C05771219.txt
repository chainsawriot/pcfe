Subject: (Reuters) Hamas says will continue attacks on Israelis

GAZA (Reuters) - A Hamas spokesman said the Islamist group would pursue attacks against Israelis despite a crackdown
against its activists in the occupied West Bank since a deadly shooting that killed four settlers. Sami Abu Zuhri said
"operations of resistance will continue and the measures by the occupation and Fatah will not block them", referring to
Israel and the Palestinian Authority which has arrested hundreds of Hamas members since the August 31 attack.
