Dear Richard:
                                                                                                                     1.4(D)

In the past two months, the TAPI project has been resuscitated, largely due to Turkmen President
Berdimukhamedov's personal outreach to his counterparts in Kabul, Islamabad and New Delhi. A "Heads of
Agreement" for the project was recently signed, and there is a possibility that the heads of state of the four
participant countries will meet in Ashgabat in December to give further political impetus to the project. As a
result, the Asian Development Bank,                                                                     has now
reengaged on the project, and has just agreed to fund technical assistance to the Afghan Ministry of Mines to
assist in negotiations with the other TAPI partners.

I have met twice with Turkmen President Berdimukhamedov since August, and TAPI is at the top of his
agenda.




We all recognize the significant hurdles that TAPI faces, both from a security and commercial standpoint,
but we believe we should do what we can to encourage forward movement on the project:



                                                                                          I have also made General
Petraeus aware of the above.

We'll let you know how this develops, and in the meantime, would be grateful for any thoughts or advice you
might have on the project.

With best regards,
Dick
