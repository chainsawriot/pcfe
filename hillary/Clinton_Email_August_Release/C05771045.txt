Subject: Russian forest fires

Jake: When I briefed S this morning on what we were doing on Russian forest fires she asked
what others were doing, and I said I'd get back to her. Answer is below. Could you pls pass
this info along? Thanks.

Eleven European countries (France, Italy, Germany, Poland, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Turkey,
Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus and Latvia) have supplied firefighters (515 total currently in
Russia) and heavy firefighting equipment (fire trucks, mobile pumping stations, bulldozers
etc.), three airplanes and six helicopters. Italy and France are providing the fire fighting
aircraft. The European Commission has offered to transport affected children to EU states or
non-affected areas of Russia for treatment of respiratory illnesses. It has also provided masks,
water, health assistance, and general non-food items. China has provided $4m total in cash and
relief supplies so far. NATO offered to help but Moscow was uninterested.

U.S. assistance totals $4.5m, including $3.5m in specialized firefighting equipment, $350k in
planned capacity building, and $50k in humanitarian assistance (bedding, food parcels). Russia
has publicly thanked the U.S. for its assistance.
