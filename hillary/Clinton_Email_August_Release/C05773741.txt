That we are. And Huma and your other girls--Capricia, Maggie, Cheryl, Kelly--all proudly show your touch as well. As
ugly and disturbed as the world can be and is these days, there are so many peaceful and beautiful people and places.
You and WJC keep tidying up all the rough patches. We'll be in NY this weekend for the WJC event. Tom may burst
upon seeing and hearing Eric Clapton. Love you, B
