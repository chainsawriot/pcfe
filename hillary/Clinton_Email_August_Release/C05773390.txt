Subject:                          Update



The Senate goes back in at 930 tues am. The Cloture vote on the cr will be at 1015. Alexander will also be recognized
for a 10 minute statement - most believe so he can announce his support for START.

Brown also announced his support for the Treaty this evening. With Alexander, that should put us at the 9 needed
Republicans (Alexander, Bennett, Brown, Collins, Gregg, Isakson, Lugar, Snowe and Voinovich). There are several others
in play (Corker, Chamblis, Cochran, McCain and Murkowski). Moreover, there are bound to be some "sleepers" as the
vp called them. This could be Roberts, Crapo, Kirk or others.

We have a meeting in the morning with Kerry, Lugar and Kyl to discuss the remaining amendments. Reid is encouraging
Kerry to offer to vote on a handful of R amendments post cloture, but then move fairly deliberately to a vote on
ratification.

The end is in sight....
