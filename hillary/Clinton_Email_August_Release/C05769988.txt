Statement by Ambassador Mark Sedwill, NATO's Senior Civilian Representative to Afghanistan

Stan McChrystal is one of the finest men I have ever known. He is and will remain a lifelong
friend.

General McChrystal has also been an outstanding military commander who was pivotal in
creating and driving forward NATO's strategy in Afghanistan to regain the initiative against
the insurgency, resolve the political tensions which fuel it and transition responsibility to the
Government of Afghanistan as we help build their capabilities.

This strategy remains the basis of the campaign. The campaign remains on course. The
Afghan people should have no doubt of our commitment to build a stable Afghanistan and a
safer world.

I look forward to working with General David Petraeus whose remarkable track record speaks
for itself. He will provide the continuity and strong leadership required to meet the challenges
ahead.
