See bottom of message re the firsts.

These were innovations we pushed (particularly use of web for real time display of pledges and what initially was
described by those who did not like my idea as pay to play (or in this instance as I argued - it was pay to have a priority
speaking slot as those who did not have a pledge would get to speak, just not until the end).

Nice addition to our innovation and tech storyline.

Subject: THANKS to Team Pledge Data

Dear members of Team Pledge Data,

 I wanted to thank all of you for your excellent work leading up and at the Conference in establishing the system for
gathering, scrubbing, presenting, projecting, and posting the pledge data from all the donors. And to thank you for
accommodating so quickly my inchoate and sleep-deprived requests yesterday morning for the changes to the format of
what was projected.

 But I wanted to make sure you realized that you accomplished something rather historic yesterday. You have
massively raised the bar for future donors' conference on how pledge data should be tracked and shared.

  Here are some of the "firsts" that you should be proud of (based at least on my experience in 8 major donors'
conferences so far):
       First to gather written pledges from all donors
    - First to project individual pledges in real time at the conference
    - First to release individual pledges to the world public and media on the same day as the conference

  In addition to these, the work that you put into scrubbing the pledges — with the rigor and integrity of development
professionals — ensured that the pledge figures were more meaningful and accurate than for most other pledging
conferences (another possible first).

  All of these achievements are great in themselves, but they will be most important in their impact on ensuring that the
pledged assistance actually makes in to the people of Haiti. This is really just the beginning of that important effort, and
you will be playing a critical role in it — but you have set us off with the best possible starting point for that effort.

Thank you again. It has been and will remain for me a pleasure for me to work with you. Best regards, Roland

Please pass this on to others on the team that I have missed in this email.
