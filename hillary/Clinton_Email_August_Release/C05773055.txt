Dear Hillary
Wanted to take a minute to thank you for what you have down. I am sure preident Clinton and Chelsea told you what is
happening at the hospital.
It was deserted when we arrived except for 1500 patients and a few administrators. Now it is starting to function. We
have done over 100 operations and each day is better. The military is working with is
now to provide food water supplies support. They are amazing. Thank
you thank you thank you. Blessings on you and your family. Will
share more when I get real Internet access. To learn more see my posts on Huffington post.
