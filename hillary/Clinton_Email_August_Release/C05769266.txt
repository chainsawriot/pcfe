Dearest Cheryl -

You are so good at what you do. I was reminded of it this morning when I heard you on NPR. You're the perfect person
to be on the ground dealing with the operation and also translating for the public what is going on. I know you don't
enjoy doing press, but you are very good at it and I think it is important for the American public to understand the
mission of the U.S. government and the high respect and deference you are giving to the Haitian government. You really
got that across this morning.

Sending you lots of love and good luck in your incredibly important mission.

xo,
Ann
