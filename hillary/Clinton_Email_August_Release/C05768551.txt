Fyi. This resolves - in some respects - the UN mandate issue Lavrov raised.

Jake —

I am not sure if this answers the question, but the issue is OBE as the mandate was adopted today.

UNAMA MANDATE RENEWAL & RUSSIAN DISCUSSION
On March 22 the Security Council renewed the UNAMA mandate by unanimous consent, but not without a short delay
at the request of Russian PermRep Churkin, who called for last-minute consultations prior to the adoption of the
mandate. Churkin took the floor in closed consultations to "begin an interactive dialogue" highlighting the drug problem
caused by Afghanistan's unabated poppy cultivation, noting it fuels domestic corruption and finances the Taliban.
Churkin's "dialogue" was triggered by a front-page Sunday New York Times article titled, "U.S. Turns a Blind Eye to
Opium in Afghan Town."

Following the adoption of the UMAMA mandate, the Russian Perm Rep took the floor in the chamber and noted Russian
support for the new UNAMA mandate which has "satisfactory language in all regards.' Churkin emphasized that the
Afghan-led policy of national reconciliation can not contradict past Council resolutions, including the sanctions regime,
and reminded that all who join the reconciliation program must lay down arms, pledge to uphold the Afghan
constitution and break ties with terrorist organizations. Churkin reminded Members that drugs represent a "direct
threat to international peace and security" and noted that "recent media reports" state that ISM has "given up" on
eradication. He called for ISAF to be "active and robust" in combating drugs.
