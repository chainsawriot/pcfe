Podesta: W.H. 'lost' health
narrative

 John Podesta, the president of the
Center for American Progress who
led Barack Obama's presidential
transition, acknowledges the White
House has been unable to
successfully drive the debate on
health care reform.

"They lost the narrative," Podesta
told the Financial Times. "They lost
the perspective of how all of the
activity they were engaged in was
knit together."

In a video interview posted on the
newspaper's website Monday,
Podesta also bemoaned the
present political climate in
Washington and expressed
frustration with inability of the White
House and Congress to advance
the president's agenda.

"Change is hard in America. We've
all learned that over the last year,"
said the former White House chief
of staff under Bill Clinton. "There is
real frustration amongst
independent voters, and anger
amongst independent voters."

Voters have become discouraged,
Podesta said, by seeing "no spirit in
which people were having a

reasonable conversation" during the
health care debate and from "the
last twist and turns on health care,
the special deals that had to be
made in the Senate to get the 60
votes."

Asked how he would rate the health
of the American political system, he
responded simply: "Sucks."

"It feels like a very frustrated
country, a country frustrated with
the inability of Washington to do
anything to get the economy going
again, to get jobs going again," he
said. "And I think that there is
tremendous anger [and] frustration
about the inability to improve
people's lives."

Republicans also have shown little
ability to raise the level of debate,
Podesta suggested.

Obama's "not dealing with the party
of Lincoln. He's dealing with the
party of Palin," Podesta said,
referring to Sarah Palin, the former
Alaska governor who was the 2008
GOP vice presidential nominee.
