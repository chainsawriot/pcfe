There are some calls on the Hill for other changes in the team, i.e. Eikenberry. So it is already starting.

If she feels strongly, sure

Otherwise I vote no. We aren't directly part of this unfortunate saga, don't need to be. Once again she and Gates
come across as the mature ones. The questions they have for her on her recommendation, etc would be addressed by
a statement.

Besides, she'll answer this on camera tomorrow

I would however add Petreaus to her call sheet even though I'm sure she saw him at the WH, so we can reinforce her
relationship with him going forward

We also need to stress their solid working relationship - I believe he was here last week and we thankfully put that on
her schedule

My bet on the direction this now takes is two fronts 1) does Petreaus make any big changes; can he do in Afghanistan
what he did in Iraq; his health; political benefits of locking him up like Huntsman; etc                               B5
                                                                                                                       B5

Had McC weathered this, there would have been more emphasis on #2. With Petreaus there, there's an air of adult
management so there will be less of that.                                                         whether there will   B5
be other changes to the team, how they get along with Petraeus and my strong suggestion to all involved is that this
change is a fresh start for all. That ends the conversation.
