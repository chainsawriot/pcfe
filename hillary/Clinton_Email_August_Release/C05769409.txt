Have not had a chance to read yet but wanted to share asap. Paul and Jean-Louis are still working on scrubbing our
strategy for adds and drops.

Subject: modalities for Haiti

Meghann,

A couple of ideas.

1. To avoid a coordination nightmare, try to get a structure in which there is a single authority with some temporary
power - e.g. a senior Haiti figure (ex-PM would be ideal) + Bill Clinton, as co-CEOs, supported by a council where you can
put the key parties on so they dont feel excluded (e.g. EU which will otherwise sulk). It could start from the April Plan and
the US Plan.

2. To scale up basic service provision without doing a total bypass of the state, I suggest the Public Service Agencies
model that I have been working up for the OECD. Essentially, centralized funding of decentralized provision. Fortuitously,
this has just been endorsed by the Davos Global Agenda Council for Fragile States and will be pitched as one of the key
ideas at Davos. I attach the brief Davos write-up of the idea, and a fuller paper that I did recently for the OECD. Please
circulate as you think fit.

If you need anything from me I will be happy to help. I will be in Davos late next week.

Paul
