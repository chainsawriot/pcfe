Subject: HRC meeting with the IMF?

Cheryl, Jake,

I received a call from Masood Ahmed, Director of the Middle East Department at the IMF. Apparently at the Haiti
meeting in NYC, the Secretary had a conversation with IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn in which she
expressed an interest in meeting with him to discuss the IMF's work in Haiti and other places.

A few weeks earlier, apparently she talked briefly with Mr. Ahmed at a meeting about Pakistan, and also expressed an
interest in meeting with the IMF to discuss their work.

The Managing Director would be very happy to meet with her. But I think they wanted to know whether she was really
interested in meeting, or whether she was being diplomatic and polite. For what it's worth, I think a meeting could be
very useful. Someone from Treasury would want to sit in.

How should I respond to them?

Thanks.
