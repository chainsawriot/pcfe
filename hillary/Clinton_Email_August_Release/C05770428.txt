Yes that is the cell number her office gave us- I've verified it so I assume it's for one of her aides. I left a couple of
messages there but didn't hear back. I will try her office again to see if we can secure any better number. I also know
huma emailed with elena earlier in the week.

The cell # for her belongs to someone else according to the vm. Can you get the right cell #?
