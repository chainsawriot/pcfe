Hi Cheryl,

Hate to bother you with so much else going on but was wondering if the Secretary had made any decisions about
coming to Dartmouth. We're holding our breath and not inviting anyone else until we hear.

We're heavily into the Haiti response and very proud of how Dartmouth has responded. The community is now well
over 5 million dollars in aid and we've sent two large teams to support Partners In Health already. This is so, so
heartbreaking!

Hope you're well!

Jim

President
