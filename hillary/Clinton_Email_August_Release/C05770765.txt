One could serve till the end of 2011. And if recess appointed, the name stays on the exec calendar and chances are the
individual would still be confirmed the old fashioned way. So there would be no need to be reappointed. The fact is
most people who are recess appointed do get confirmed.

FYI — the Senate is likely to pass the supp tonight. And, no nominees from any government agency will be confirmed
tonight or tomorrow. Would like to discuss the potential for recess appointments with you and Cheryl.

The Brookings event, especially your opening remarks, were excellent. Very thoughtful, with lots of real-life examples.
We have gotten lots of positive feedback.
