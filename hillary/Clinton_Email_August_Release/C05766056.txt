I went back upstairs with Dr Kissinger and we talked about it. I regret the seating, it just begged Meacham to interview
you, to ask a question, then alternate answering. Was just a very different dynamic than you two before the sitdown. It
would be bad TV. But it's print.

So as an observer, and I think this will come across to the reader, it was a fascinating meeting of two eras that are very
different but very the same. Two very different people, but the same job, experiencing it much the same way. His spiel
at the end about the goal should be more than ending the war will translate well.

And most importantly, the photos look great

He was also a sport and called my friend and talked for 10 mins about non-proliferation
