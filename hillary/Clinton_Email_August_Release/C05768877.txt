I'm not
For a few reasons

First, calmness is not such a bad thing in these moments. Calm is not cavalier, which you weren't

Second, you're not the EPA administrator or Interior Secretary - nobody will see you as a front line cabinet officer on this

Third, if this is still out of control on Sunday, the administration has bigger problems

So I'm really not worried.
Here it is again which might allay your concerns



SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, David, I think that the President has ordered the departments that deal with this —
Homeland Security, Interior, Environmental Protection, Defense — to all immediately not only do everything possible to
mitigate the effects of this spill, but to try to come up with recommendations going forward. The first order of business,
however, is to try to get this spill under control, which has been, as you know, very difficult, and to prevent further
damage to the coastline along Louisiana to the fishing waters, to the wildlife. I think it does raise questions which the
President has said have to be answered. He put forth a very comprehensive approach that included the potential of
drilling off of our own shores. That is a national security concern because we have to do better to lessen our
dependence on foreign oil. But it has to be done safely. It can't be done at the risk of having to spend billions of dollars
cleaning up these spills. So as with so much in these difficult areas, it's going to require a balancing act.

I'm worried that by Sunday my answer will seem too calm under the circumstances.
