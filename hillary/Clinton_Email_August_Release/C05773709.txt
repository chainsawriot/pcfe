Thank you SO much! We will get the photo off widely.

Had a good meeting w Melinda Gates. They are ready to support our maternal and child health initiative. Your husband
touched everyone here with his Haiti plea.
We're making good progress on women's issues.

The secretary had her picture taken with the 4 women right before her press conference. She met them as she walked
to the site, and then invited them to walk with her to the press conference. The four Afghan women sat together during
the conference and the Secretary asked them to rise so she could acknowledge and applaud their courageous work
promoting women's rights in Afghanistan. We will send some photos around. Cheers, P

Caroline and Ashley:

Saba Ghori (from the State Department's Office of Global Women's Issues covering Afghanistan) can be reached at
          She is in London and in contact with the 4 Afghan Civil Society Women representatives observing today's
conference, and understands here is a possibility of a,photo/pull aside for the Afghan women with the Secretary.

 Of the Afghan women, three are at the media center, and one is at the civil society conference. Saba doesn't have a way
 to access the media canter/Lancaster House. If the Secretary can do this photo opp/pull aside, someone would need to

             Hope you can help to coordinate with Saba and 4 Afghan women.

Thanks,
Anjana

Saba and Modi,

 I have included the Secretary's press team Ashley Yehl and Caroline Adler on this chain. They are best placed to
 coordinate with Huma and Philippe on this. Sarah Jane-Mayhew, our official photographer, will be at the media center at
 about 1530.

Matt,

This is the email chain regarding the a possibly opportunity for the 4 Afghan women civil society representatives to meet
with the Secretary and take a photo. Three of the 4 are in the media center and Saba who has been travelling with them
isPhil suggested she contact Huma. If you have other thoughts on who Saba can contact let me know and I'll pass that
info along.

Saba is from the State Department's Office of Global Women's Issues covering Afghanistan for the U.S. Ambassador-at-
Large for Global Women's Issues, Ambassador Melanne Verveer.

Thanks,
Anjana
