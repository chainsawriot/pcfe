JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on the Palestinian leadership to renounce an
official Palestinian report asserting the Western Wall, one of Judaism's holiest sites, is not Jewish. Al-Mutawakil Taha,
deputy information minister in the Palestinian Authority, published a five-page study disputing Jews' reverence of the
shrine as a retaining wall of the compound of Biblical Jewish Temples destroyed centuries ago. "Denial of the
connection between the Jewish people and the Western Wall by the Palestinian Authority's Ministry of Information is
baseless and scandalous," Netanyahu said in a statement issued by the prime minister's office. "The Israeli government
expects the leaders of the Palestinian Authority to renounce the document and condemn it, and to stop twisting
historical facts," he said. In the report, Taha wrote the Western wall is a "Muslim wall and an integral part of al-Aqsa
mosque and Haram al-Sharif," a position echoing past statements by the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Taha
issued the document after Israel approved five-year renovation plan for the Western Wall area.
