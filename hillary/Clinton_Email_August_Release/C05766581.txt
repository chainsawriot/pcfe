Cheryl, Thank you again for a wonderful lunch today. Along with the food (which was great!) I really appreciated the
chance to sit down with everyone informally and just chat and eat. While we work with each person here on an
individual basis, it is rare to have the opportunity for all of us to be in the same place at the same time with no formal
agenda. You have assembled a great team -- which has both an abundance of smarts and personality — and I'm grateful
that we had a chance to see each other one more time before we all dispersed for the holidays. Looking forward to
2010, Zia.
