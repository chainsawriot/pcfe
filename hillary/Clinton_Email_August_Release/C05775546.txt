Cheryl, Tamara: Have heard from Huma and we know it is only an airport stop. You were both so kind to take the time to
respond.

FYI We have an american friend translating for us so we get unedited version of private comments of elites we see.
Would like to pass on following:

Listening to translation of our more senior Chinese hosts commentary on her visit, she is clearly seen here as a figure of
extraordinary influence on the global stage.
Her words on regional issues, whether praising or questioning, provoke extensive commentary. Complete sentences
parsed and discussed. Fascinating juxtaposition vs back in US.

Hello David - I wish we could figure something out but unfortunately we are super late, we are about to land at the airport,
doing an official meeting and has to leave asap. Isn't even getting off airport grounds. So sorry, its just such a fly by night
stop.

Huma: We are very proud of our friend the Secretary and the job she is doing. But your foreign trip logistics are hard
enough. Seeing old friends should hold no priority in relation to her important work, notwithstanding the coincidence of our
weekend visit to Hainan.

If she'd like a short reprieve from official duties, and logistics permit, we would of course love to say hello.

(Herb Miller and I are invited by Hainan officials for Monday morning, hosted by fmr Vice Chmn of China Agricultural
Bank. We are here in relation to Central Committee plans for Hainan becoming a leading international tourism

Amy

So nice to hear from you.

I am not certain what her sked permits but I know how much she thinks of you and David.

I am adding Huma who is traveling w/ S to advise as to her availability for a hello given her trip commitments.

Thanks for reaching out.

All the best.

Dear Cheryl,
I hope all is well with you. We are all thrilled about the perception of HRC and the job she has been doing for us all.
Makes me miss my old ambassadorial days working with State.

As you can see by the below email to me, husband David Dunn (a lawyer/not lobbiest at Patton Boggs, and an old friend
of Hillary's) and another Hillary friend, Herb Miller, will be on Hainan Island on Sat. and Sun. Oct 30 and 31 (already Sat.
morning there now) to go to the city of Sanya to visit the Mayor. They are there to commit to a major commercial mall
project in Sanya with their Chinese partners, Huinong Capital.

They believe that HRC will be visiting Sanya as well in the same time frame and will meet with officials there.

They would love to say hello to HRC to show US businessmen committed to expanded US China trade relations if convenient for her
and not an interference. David can be reached at

Thanks Cheryl.

Warmly,
Amy Bondurant
