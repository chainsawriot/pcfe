Subject: From Arturo re Bolivia

Madame Secretary:

I'd like to update you on our efforts to engage with Bolivia.
                                                                                                                          B5


You engaged personally and through Maria Echaveste as we've tried to think and act creatively to extract positives from
a difficult starting point. Echaveste visited Bolivia in June and September 2009, and I traveled there this June to
underline our commitment to better relations; you met with FM Choquehuanca at the OAS GA in Lima later that month;
and Labor Secretary Solis and Maria Otero traveled to President Morales' inauguration in January 2010.
