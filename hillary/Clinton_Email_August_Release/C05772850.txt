HALIFAX (AP) â€”Canada's defense minister says Canada is considering a U.S. request to keep troops in Afghanistan past
2011 and switch from a combat to a training role. Defense Minister Peter MacKay said November 7 the troops would be
"behind the wire" and not remain in Afghanistan's volatile southern Kandahar province. Parliament has mandated that
the combat mission end in 2011. U.S. Senators John McCain said Lindsey Graham, who both sit on the Armed Services
Committee, urged Canada November 6 to remain in Afghanistan past 2011.
