Dear Cheryl,

The member states today confirmed unanimously my election to chair the Development Assistance Committee of OECD.
This is a strong mandate and I would not have received it without your support. I look forward to receiving your good
advice and counsel during my term of office-- and beyond. Many thanks.

Brian
