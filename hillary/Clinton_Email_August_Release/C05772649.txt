MS -- Rich Verma would like to add a conference call this afternoon with the House Republicans to give them an update
on the Haiti relief efforts. It would be an ideal way to cover many of these people instead of doing individual calls down
the road. The time that works best for folks on the Hill is 3:30pm -- okay to add to your schedule?
