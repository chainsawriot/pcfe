I'm off to Seattle for a conf on development and women at Microsoft and mtgs with Gates, etc.
I wanted to tell you that for your trip to Russia, we have an announcement for you to Gov of St Petersburg who is the
highest ranking female official in the Russian govt. When I saw her some months ago, she went on at length about her
respect for you and her meeting with you when you were Senator (she also met you at the Rejkavik W conf in '98) We
are going to hold a US-Russia women leaders Summit in St P in aprik It is in response to what I heard over and over
during my trip earlier this year that there is a strong desire (and need) to engage with US. Women and the women's
issues have been mostly off the agenda since the days we made it such a priority in the 90's and there is considerable
recidivism. She should be happy about the proposed summit.

Secondly, when you meet with the Lithuanian FM this week, he will invite you to the community of Democ ministerial
(end for Lith presidency) and as part of it a women and democ. Conf that will mark 10 years since the last one that was
held in the continuum you started. There are so many different needs today.

Have a good trip.
