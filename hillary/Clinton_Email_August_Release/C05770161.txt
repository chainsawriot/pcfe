Kurt and Cheryl,

In my meeting yesterday with FM Smith, he said he'd still like to speak with S. Originally, they were scheduled
to talk last Friday but it was cancelled. Given the change in leadership, and Smith's increased responsibility --
taking on trade and aid portfolios as well as foreign affairs -- I think a brief call would be helpful.

Also, I spoke at length with former PM Rudd on Monday. Although he did not raise the issue, his aide called
Edgard afterward and noted that Rudd had not heard from S, and would have hoped for a sympathetic call. I
have no strong point of view on this one. He has received such a call from POTUS already.

         But, I think he and S had a good relationship and he may want to talk to her about his future career
goals.

Best,

J.
