Attended Ambassador Capricia's event last night at the Art Institute. It was a magical evening.
                                                                        We sat with the ambassador
from Guyana and the ambassador from the Philippines. Lovely people. A staff from the Dept of
State sat with us: Gladys                                     hope she would report that we
behaved. A lovely idea this field trip for the big guys/gals.
                      ambassadors pretending that they were more excited about going to the
Merc. Rick's group doing a great job. Now if only the weather would cooperate. We had 2 1/2 inches
of rain this morning.
