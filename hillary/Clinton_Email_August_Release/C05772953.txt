Subject: (AP) Hezbollah: We won't accept arrests

BEIRUT (AP) - The leader of Hezbollah says his militant group will "cut the hand" of anyone who tries to arrest any
member of the party. Sheik Hassan Nasrallah said in a speech the group will not accept any accusation against any of its
fighters or leaders in the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. He said the group would defend itself
anyway it chooses. He did not elaborate.
