The new year is bound to bring in a continuing wave of crisis around the world. Consider this photo a momentary
respite. It is evocative of the good feeling you engender everywhere. The photo is of the Director of New Life Center in
Chiang Mai. They are doing incredible work there and have made exceptional progress since your visit. They remember
you with great gratitude. I had one of your signed photos left after distributing the others to the Burmese women
human rights leaders (who also felt that you were on their side).

Everywhere I went over the holidays, there was much favorable comment about your leadership. I'm so proud to be
back working with you. Because you've created such ripples of hope, we've got so much to do!

Love to all the Clintons and best wishes for a healthy, happy, productive and rewarding New Year.
