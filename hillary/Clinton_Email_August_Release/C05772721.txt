Subject: (AP) Marna, Cameron call for review over slain worker

WASHINGTON (AP) - The White House said President Obama and British Prime Minister Cameron agree their nations
must investigate what happened during an American rescue attempt in which a captive British aid worker was killed in
Afghanistan.
  The White House said President Obama called Cameron to offer condolences. Officials said Obama and Cameron both
agreed the rescue operation was necessary and it was essential to "get to the bottom" of what happened in the rescue
attempt.
