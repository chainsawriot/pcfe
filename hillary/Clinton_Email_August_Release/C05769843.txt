                                        STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY


                            Congratulations to President-Elect Aquino of the Philippines

I join President Obama in congratulating President-elect Benigno "Noynoy" Aquino III, whom the Filipino
people have chosen to lead their nation. The Philippines' successful election exemplified the vitality of the
country's democratic institutions and should be a point of pride for Filipinos everywhere. The Filipino people
now look to President-elect Aquino to carry forward the democratic traditions that his parents did so much to
champion. The United States has long stood with the Philippines as a trusted ally and friend and we will
continue to support the ongoing efforts of the Filipino people to build a secure and prosperous country.
