Subject: Trip reading -- Bangladesh is following the lead of the QDDR

This is a very thoughtful piece that identifies many of the same factors we are in our diplomatic chapter (and that is not
just because the author – the former Bangladesh ambassador to the US—cites me). What is most striking is that it
affirms that our analysis in the QDDR offers a set of questions that foreign ministries all over the world are grappling
with. I had hoped to have time to do some traveling to broadcast the QDDR to key allies and partners around the world
after the QDDR is in, but even if that can't happen, we will devise an outreach strategy re sending the report out to
foreign ministers around the world and to our ambassadors that will greatly amplify its impact. AM
