I just got Huma's message about dinner. My blackberry died and I was recharging it so didn't have it with me. I would
have loved to have had dinner with you and Melanne and had a chance to catch up. Our meetings went well this
afternoon.


Hope the rest of the trip goes well. Look forward to seeing you next week. I'm heading down to Mexico on Wednesday
afternoon to work with Carlos on the strategic communications issues.

Safe travels.

Judith,




Below is a rough outline of your trip to Doha, as it currently stands.




LOGISTICS:




You are currently scheduled to arrive in Doha on May 1 at 6:30 and depart May 2 at 7 pm. Traveling with you will be
Kitty DiMartino, Joe Mellott, Mark Davidson, and GSEC's LTC Eric Schoennauer. Dana Smith will fly in from the Media
Hub in Dubai to meet you in Doha.




Key events:




Dinner with Al Jazeera (AJ) staff: AJ Director General Wadah Khanfar will host a dinner on May 1 with senior Al staff,
including AJ English Managing Director Tony Burman. We expect 7 people on the Al side and 6 on ours. (The dinner is
schedule for 8pm in a private room in the Four Seasons; post is making reservations for the party to stay in the same
hotel.)




Meeting with AJ Board Members at AJ Headquarters: This will give you an opportunity to engage the Qatari leadership
of the network. Discussions topics should include the mid-May Washington visit by some Al Board representatives. We
expect Wadah Khanfar to also participate in this meeting.




(TBC) Meeting with Prime Minister Hamad bin Jasim bin Jabir al-Thani (HBJ): As PM, HBJ is the ultimate Qatari authority
on Al. The meeting will also allow you to raise bi-lateral engagement issues as necessary. We expect to know in a few
days if HBJ will be available.




Meetings with CENTCOM: You will meet with CENTCOM staff at Al Udeid airbase just outside of Doha. They will brief
you on their                                .within their AOR, but with particular focus on activities in        B1
                                                                                                                      1.4(D)



MEDIA:




Feature on AJ Arabic: 15 minute "feature" piece filmed at AJ Studios on the Administration's commitment to
engagement with Muslim communities worldwide. This will be a good opportunity to highlight the Entrepreneurship

Summit. We can expect you to also get questions on PD programs in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. You will be
interviewed by one of Al's "top" journalists; exactly who is still to be determined. The interview will be in English with
simultaneous interpretation into Arabic. It will likely air a number of times on AJ.




Feature on AJ English: This would be a second 15 minute "feature" piece similar to the one for Al Arabic. If we are
pressed for time we can consider just doing the Al Arabic feature.




Roundtable with local Qatari media: This will include journalists from a number of local Qatari media outlets. This is
another opportunity to talk about the Administration's commitment to engagement, but with a more targeted focus on
bilateral engagement and exchange programs.




Note — Wadah Khanfar has been closely engaged on, if not driving, the portions of your program that deal with Al. Post
reports that he is very pleased to have this opportunity for you to engage with Al leadership in Doha.




Best,

Ann
