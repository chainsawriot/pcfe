I have asked INR if there is any research on the security issue to help guide us and I assume we could also reach out to
the IC to get their in-put.

I am working on a note to Denis which I will send to him before I leave for Argentina tonight. I'll copy all of you on it. Let
me know if you want me to run the draft by you before I send it. It will follow the lines of my note to Raj.

FYI, I am forwarding you a message I just sent to Raj about the article in today's Washington Post.




He and I agreed to work closely on this issue. I have asked INR to get us some research on the security issue which the
implementing partners frequently raise                                                        Note the comment in the
Post about the security situation.




As you know we are moving forward on the broader branding issue and plan to have a team of experts advise us as we
move forward.




I will keep you posted.

Raj:




Hope the trip went well. You may have already seen the attached article but in light of our recent conversations I
wanted to forward it on to you.




Please know that I will help you in any way I can to deal with this situation.




Look forward to discussing it further when you return.
