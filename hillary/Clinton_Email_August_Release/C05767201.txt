   Re: Game back on, NI

   Shaun just called, 7:50 pm EST, to relate the latest sequence and to tell you that after near
   breakdown of negotiations on Monday they are back on track (maybe). Robinson went into his
   assembly on Monday thinking he could pull off the deal, but was shocked to discover the degree
   of opposition, centering partly on Reg Empey (UUP). (Cameron has tried to forge an alliance of
   UUP, elements of DUP and the Tories, on the agenda at the secret country house meeting last
   week.) But tonight, Wednesday, Shaun has got Robinson and McGuiness to agree to all points,
   pushing past the previous sticking point on the Minister of Justice and relation to the Executive.
   The matter now rests with Robinson and his ability to sell it tomorrow. He has told Shaun and
   Gordon he believes he can do it. He needs 75 percent of his party. So, the perils of peace
   continue.
