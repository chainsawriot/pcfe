                                   New Life Children's Refuge (NLCR)

    New Life Children's Refuge is a non-profit Christian ministry dedicated to rescuing, loving and
   caring for orphaned, abandoned and impoverished Haitian and Dominican children,
    demonstrating God's love and helping each child find healing, hope, joy and new life in Christ.
    We will strive to also equip each child with a solid education and vocational skills as well as
    opportunities for adoption into a loving Christian family.

    NLCR is in the process of buying land and building an orphanage, school and church in Magante
    on the northern coast of the Dominican Republic. Given the urgent needs from this
    earthquake, God has laid upon our hearts the need to go now vs. waiting until the permanent
    facility is built. He has provided an interim solution in nearby Cabarete, where we will be
    leasing a 45 room hotel and converting it into an orphanage until the building is complete.

    Future Buildings and Plans for NLCR in Magante

      • Nueva Vida Refugio de Ninos: Provide a loving Christian home-like environment for up to 200

        teens up to age 16.

      • Nueva Vida Escuela Cristiana: Provide a solid education for children in the refuge as well as in the

        as well as Christian values/truths. Plan to add higher grades and courses on vocational skills when
