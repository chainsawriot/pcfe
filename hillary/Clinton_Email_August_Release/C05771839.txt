Just won't stop...


New York, NY -- September 20, 2010 â€” "NBC Nightly News" anchor and managing editor Brian Williams
interviewed President Jimmy Carter to discuss the release of his new book "White House Diary." The interview
airs tonight on "NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams."

BRIAN WILLIAMS: The last photo of you with your-- fellow former presidents, you were well off to the side
on the right. And I thought to myself, well, there's-- there's a possible metaphor. (LAUGHTER) What is it--
about you, you think, the way you've-- decided to conduct your life and post-presidency? Do you feel listened
to? Do you feel-- that you receive your due? Or do you feel, in fact, apart from the crowd?

JIMMY CARTER: No. I-- I feel that my role as a former president is probably superior to that of other
presidents. Primarily because of the activism and the-- and the injection of working at the Carter Center and in
international affairs, and to some degree, domestic affairs, on energy conservation, on-- on environment, and
things of that kind. We're right in the midst of the-- of the constant daily debate.

And-- and-- and the Carter Center has decided, under my leadership, to fill vacuums in the world. When-- when
the United States won't deal with troubled areas, we go there and we meet with leaders who can bring an end to
a conflict, or an end to a human rights abuse, and so forth. So I-- I feel that have an advantage over many other
former presidents in being involved in daily affairs that have shaped the policies of our nation and the world.
