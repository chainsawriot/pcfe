Subject:                           DR Haiti conference on June 2



The Dominican minister here in Costa Rica said the DR would host a "World Conf on Haiti" on June 2 in the DR (of
course). First I'd heard of it, and, I assume, first for you too. Are you or someone in our world or Bill's in contact w them?
Pres Fernandez is a force to be reckoned w since he spans the Latin Am political spectrum fro Chavez to us. I will see him
later in Guatemala. We are handicapped by our lack of an Ambassador there--what is latest on Raul? Will he ever be
nominated?
