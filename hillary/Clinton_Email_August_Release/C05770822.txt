Things aren't as bad as they seem.

It took a little bit to figure out, but turns out that O'Reilly didn't have a new show last night - in its place they re-aired the
show from May 17th, the original night Posner got beat up. I guess O'Reilly is taking a 4-day weekend, don't ask me why
they picked that show to air in its place. So you were watching a repeat:

O'Reilly is still going after Mike over the Chinese/ Arizona law comment.
