Just fyi, thought you might be interested in the opening line of a pamphlet that the British policy
planning office put out on "Better International Policy." The Introduction, written by the
Permanent Under-Secretary of States, opens: "The FCO is at the centre of policy making on
international issues in Whitehall. We are the experts in government at analyzing and influencing
what is happening overseas and in turning this into clear and well-judged policy advice for
Ministers."
