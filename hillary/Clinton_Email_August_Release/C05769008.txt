Thank you for the kind words! It meant so much to see you speak, and was wonderful to witness that room full of
energetic women and men clapping and nodding--a microcosm of the global movement. I loved the additional stories
you told, esp the women working in the fields and how they could shut down the economy on their own in one swoop.

I'm hard at work on Ireland -- feeling my nationalism stirring!

Thank you again for the email and the chance to join you in NY.

Thx for all you did to make it work. I thought it went very well and I was so pleased you could be there. Now, onto the
Irish!
