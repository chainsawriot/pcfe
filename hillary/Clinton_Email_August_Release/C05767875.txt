I told the NYT that 17 people died in broad daylight. We took the investigation seriously from the outset. We called in
the FBI to join the investigation and more than two years later we continue to pursue the case and seek justice. We did
not attempt to characterize his purported testimony in any way.

I reached out to Jesse Tampio, the L attorney who knows most about the Blackwater investigation, who is now in a
negotiation in the Marshall Islands. Here is what he responded through the DCM in Manjuro:

Subject: Call from NYT
Importance: High

I just received a call from Jim Risen of the NYT. He says there were court documents unsealed this evening regarding
Blackwater and Nissour Square. In the documents, David Farrington, DS agent, claims there was a cover-up by other
RSOs who handled evidence in such a way that they hoped the case would go away. He is writing for tomorrow. We
have an immediate challenge of how to respond this evening for tomorrow's paper and then how to respond tonight or
tomorrow when there is pick-up of the story. This will reverberate in Iraq as well. I assume that we are generally familiar
with what Mr. Farrington said in court. So what is our view of his allegations? Did we investigate what he claimed? What
were our conclusions? I would recommend a one-line response to Risen tonight but we will need more detailed
guidance for tomorrow. Let me know how to proceed and what the facts are.
