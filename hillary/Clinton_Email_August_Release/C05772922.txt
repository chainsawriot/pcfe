I didn't know they were doing operations in the conference room. Can we get some details--and promise new carpet?

I just got called by the French Ambo. The                                  has had a cerebral haemmorage and needs
to be medivaced. We're working on getting         on a plane to Miami.          was medivaced today. Army doctors tell
me they just did their 100th operation in our multi-purpose (aptly named) conference room â€” including 4 amputations.
They joked: "Sorry, but you're gonna need a new carpet sir."




Let's see what tomorrow brings....
