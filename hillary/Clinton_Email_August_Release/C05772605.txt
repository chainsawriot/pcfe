Subject: How to Address Global Burden of Chronic Disease

Dear Hillary,

I wanted to pass on some thoughts we are formulating on how to address the global burden of chronic disease and get
your input    We could have a short call about this if you have time..

I have been thinking about how Paul Farmer created a whole movement around infectious disease globally and how we
can apply that to chronic disease -- and yes - I would love to meet him and talk with him about this problem.

So here's the problem.

1. By 2020 global mortality from chronic disease will claim 50 million lives compared to 20 million for communicable or
infectious disease and currently mortality in DEVELOPING WORLD is 29 million people a year from chronic disease.

2. As you know in the US, chronic disease care (usually at end stage in acute settings) accounts for almost 80% of health
care expenditures. This is likely to increase globally and in developing countries because countries like India have
diabetes rates of 25%. Mortality from heart disease in China in 35 to 44 year olds has increased 300% in the last few
decades.

3. Global Funding for prevention and treatment of the causes of chronic disease doesn't match the disease burden by
an unacceptable margin.

4. Less than 5% of funding from governments, NGO's, private foundations is for chronic disease (i.e. World Bank - $4.5
billion to health sector work, 2.5% for non-communicable disease and Global Fund focuses only on HIV/AIDS, malaria
and TB and the WHO spends $7.50 for infectious disease and $0.50 for chronic disease, Gates Foundation: no funding
for chronic disease).



So here's what I see as the solution

We need a movement to create awareness, build the messaging, fund comparative research on innovative methods for
preventing and treating chronic disease, develop changes in medical education to scale training for providers in effective
prevention and treatment of chronic disease, build partnerships and support for demonstration projects and other
initiatives, and develop health information technology platforms to support chronic disease prevention and care as an
integrated system and other disruptive technologies.

There are a lot of potential partners for this -- but I was thinking that a strategic alliance could be made between the
Institute for Functional Medicine and the Clinton Foundation (and potentially other key partners) to build and scale this
movement -- then it would be much easier to raise awareness and raise money. I have a lot of donors who would fund
something like this but it has to have organization and clout and staying power.

I also wonder if Chelsea would be interested in being part of/leading this initiative - it seems right up her alley and I
know she is looking for a job in June!

And I also realized that the State Department plays a large role in global health issues and there are ways the State Dept
can help address the chronic disease epidemic globally.



Many of pieces of this are already in place and happening - for example the VA of New England wants to bring the
Functional Medicine model into the care of their patients. The health system in Colombia is implementing a model
based on Functional medicine because they cannot cope with their chronic disease burden. CIGNA wants to bring this
into their 11 million subscribers. We are building a research institute at Harvard and clinical programs. But it all needs
organization and strategy and coordination and funding in an integrated way.

Would you have a few minute to talk about this in the next week or so?

Hope you are staying warm        Thanks again for all your help and support



Fondly,

Mark
