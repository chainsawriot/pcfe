Hi Hillary,
Once again I am imposing on our friendship to get to you a matter that is important to
               Bruce Ramer and, therefore , important to me. I am enclosing his note to
me Just so you can read how he really talks! I know his relationship with his friend
          and can attest to the personal nature of his appeal. Thank you for whatever
attention you give to this which, by my understanding, seems to be a simple matter of
justice. Alas, nothing is simple. All the best, Brian

letter).

thereto--a letter from the IRS to •ce –r,  rent.ine Embassy, a revenue 1-111 ng end a
certification issued this 'ear by th.F, State Department.

           My letter contains a brief summary of the situation and argument.

           This is, as I said, very meaningful to me. Thank you for helping in an
-incispensibie way.
