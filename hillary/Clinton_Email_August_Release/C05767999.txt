Ma'am â€” Jake tells me that you are tired of the Lamplighter story. I'm sorry, I didn't know. But the Belfast people have
come up with a FANTASTIC story -- apparently, as per your request, they have tracked down the two kids who won the
peace essay contest in the 90s, and they are doing great things -- one is a teacher, one is a police officer. They are now
reaching out to get permission for you to tell their stories tomorrow night; assuming they will grant it, I am writing up
their stories now and will fax a revised draft to you shortly.

Sorry for the Lamplighter redux; I'll let Lissa know it's off-limits for at least a few years.

Thx for all you did to make it work. I thought it went very well and I was so pleased you could be there. Now, onto the
Irish!
