SUBJECT:            U.S. Participation at Expo 2012 Yeosu Korea

Recommendation
       Unless the Department implements an alternative model for participation, ECA
recommends that you sign the attached letter (Tab B) informing the Koreans that there
will be no official U.S. participation at the 2012 Yeosu Expo. EAP opposes.

      Approve                    Disapprove                   Date

       Alternatively, EAP recommends that you sign the proposed Letter of Intent (Tab

      Approve                       Disapprove                        Date

Background

       In November 2009, the Department received a formal invitation from the
Republic of Korea to participate in the Expo 2012 Yeosu Korea, an off-year expo. ECA
recommends against participation unless the Department can implement an alternative
model for participation and EAP recommends participation. Both positions are outlined
in the attachments.

Tab A: Background and Positions

Background
       In November 2009, the Department received a formal invitation from the
Republic of Korea to participate in Expo 2012 Yeosu Korea. Large-scale expos, known
as "registered expos," including Shanghai 2010, are held every five years; however,
Yeosu is an off-year "recognized expo," and, as such, is shorter in length (three months
duration), smaller in scale, and has a narrower theme than registered expos. To date, 35
countries have agreed to participate. The cost of U.S. participation has been tentatively
estimated at $10-15 million.
       Since 1994, when Congress legislated that the Department may not expend funds
for international expos unless specifically authorized or appropriated, the U.S. has only
participated in one off-year expo: Lisbon 1998. Funding for the off-year Lisbon expo
came primarily through appropriated funds transferred to USIA from other federal
government agencies, with the remainder coming from private sector contributions. In
1999, Congress tightened restrictions by further legislating that no funds made available
to the Department by another federal agency may be obligated or expended for such
expo purposes without prior congressional notification. Since then, 100% private sector
funding has been sought for all U.S. Pavilions at world expos and no appropriations
have been requested from Congress.
