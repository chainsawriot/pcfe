Barney Rubin knows him so I asked him to call back on your behalf—here is the feedback no need to call him back. ..

  He was calling Cheryl because he wanted to tell the Secretary of State that he has been contacted by tribes and ulama
from both sides of the border. They have proposals for the US strategy and also a message about the interest in peace
of some of the insurgents. I told him that our office handled those issues on behalf of the Secretary of State and that we
would schedule an appointment with him the week after the Karzai visit.

I have been in touch with him most recently because he is doing research on corruption in Afghanistan and wrote to tell
me                                                                                                              ie asked     B6
me to set up a meeting with the Secretary of State. I said I could not do that. I made clear that
                           He had written to me to say that he would keep my interests in mind, and I wrote back to say
                                                                                             He wrote back to say I had
misunderstood. Then he made the contact with the secretary's office directly.
