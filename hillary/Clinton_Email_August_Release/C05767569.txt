      •    We have raised $21.4mm. This is historic. Big surges as a result of the NFL PSAs.
      •    I didn't watch the Golden Globes but looking at the data, I don't think they made an announcement, but
           the #s are still strong

2. SMS 4636 info project (where people in Haiti can text and report needs and locations):

      • 707 texts were rec'd, 402 were deemed useful, 125 had enough details that volunteers on the ground
        could plot the longitude and latitude to find them quickly
      • Only works on Digicel. Comcel/Voila are evaluating
      • Trying to get Wyclef and radio stations to start promoting
      • Data is currently going to Reuters Emergency Service, InSTEDD and ICRC
