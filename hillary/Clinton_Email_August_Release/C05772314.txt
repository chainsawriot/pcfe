Subject: (Reuters) UAE gives Palestinian Authority $42 million

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates donated S42 million to the Palestinian Authority, boosting support
for President Mahmoud Abbas' cash-strapped government as it embarks on direct peace talks with Israel, Arab officials
said on September 10. An Arab source in Washington said the donation, which was confirmed by a Palestinian
government spokesman, was made after repeated calls by senior U.S. officials for more Arab support to help build
Palestinian government capacity. "It is a timely gesture of support both for the talks and the institution-building project
of the PA, as well as a response to the public urging from President Obama and Secretary Clinton," the source said.
Palestinian government spokesman Ghassan al-Khatib confirmed the UAE donation but declined to give further details.
