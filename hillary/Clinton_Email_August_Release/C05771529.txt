Subject: From Arturo - Correa Rescued in Ecuador

Madame Secretary: After a tense day in which President Correa was slightly injured at noon by rioting and striking
police, and later was barred from leaving the hospital by the same, the army finally rescued him at 9pm last night. Some
military units, including the Navy unit in Guayaquil appeared to support the police. The police also occupied the national
congress. As the rescue took place, the head of the Ecuadoran Joints Chiefs of Staff issued a statement supporting the
president, and noting that the armed forces respect the rule of law "in which the President [Rafael Correa] is the
maximum authority of the three branches." Things are now calm.

Reaction in the hemisphere was one of deep concern. The OAS adopted a resolution; South American presidents at the
call of UNASUR travelled to Buenos Aires and are likely to go on to Quito to support Correa. Several, including Garcia
and Santos, called Correa. Zapatero also spoke with him. Moratinos tried to reach you at around 6pm last evening to
convey that news, I took the call.

As you know, we issued a statement of support for Correa. I also gave an interview to CNN in Spanish, which was re-
played frequently. I strongly recommend that you call Correa today to reiterate U.S. support for his government and to
wish him well.

He will appreciate it but, more broadly, it sends a signal that the United States supports the constitutional order and
rejects any attempt to undermine it. Chavez in Buenos Aires predictably declared that we were behind the unrest. We
have prepared a call sheet for you.
