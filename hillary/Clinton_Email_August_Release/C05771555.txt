             QDDR Marks Bold Step Forward in Strengthening America's
                                 Civilian Power

     Washington, DCâ€” The U.S. Global Leadership Coalition today released the following
     statement from Executive Director Liz Schrayer on the preview of the Quadrennial Diplomacy
     and Development Review:

     "As part of the USGLC's Impact '08 initiative, a bipartisan working group of foreign policy
     experts called on the next administration to conduct a Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development
     Review. We believed such a review was a vital step in modernizing our civilian-led tools of
     global engagement, and we congratulate Secretary Clinton and Administrator Shah for tackling
     this monumental and necessary task.

     "The preview of the QDDR released last week represents a bold step towards implementing a
     smart power foreign policy by elevating our civilian power and ensuring effective, results-driven
     programs. While we have not seen the full report and expect varying views on some of the
     recommendations, the initial outline includes several significant highlights that are essential for
     America to meet today's global challenges: Increasing the resources and human capacity for
     State and USAID; reinstituting budget and planning authority for USAID; and putting in place
     monitoring and evaluation efforts with clear metrics and a guarantee of program transparency.

     "Today's global threats require the use of a wide range of tools, and the QDDR can help ensure
     our international affairs programs continue to make a critical impact in advancing our national
     security and economic intersts."
