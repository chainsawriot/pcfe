Subject                           Good press from Carla Hills



Great interview w/ her on cnn or msnbc where she talked about how impt it is to have a strategic and economic
dialogue and how the long term importance is less specific deliverables than increased understanding of why each side
takes the positions it does prduces good results over time --that we've seen that in the past. Given that she is a former
USTR and a Republican, it was a good plug. and you look great on CNN! AM
