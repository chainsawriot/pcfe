JERUSALEM (AP) - Israeli police said envelopes containing a suspicious white powder have been discovered at the
American, Spanish and Swedish embassies in Tel Aviv. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said workers at the three
embassies alerted police after opening the envelopes September 14. Rosenfeld said it is still unclear what the substance
is though police said the substance was not poisonous since no one was hurt. Police are trying to find who sent the
envelopes and determine whether the incidents were connected.
