The hearings on wednesday are off. The senate foreign relations committee moved its hearing to Thursday am. And
house foreign ops is tentatively scheduled for thursday afternoon. Given the forecast, neither of these may actually
occur.

Starting to hear that murtha funeral will be saturday in johnstown, but that is not confirmed yet. Will let you know.

I am so sorry we lost him. Ed Rendell told me he wants to hold a big memorial service in the State Capitol in Harrisburg
but he hasn't spoken to Joyce yet. I haven't either. I'd like to go too wherever it is. Let me know what you hear.

Also, since the govt is closed again tomorrow and Congress cancelled too, and another big storm is expected tomorrow
night, do you think Congress will even bother showing up for our hearings? I'm planning on working from home.

Still haven't heard anything about funeral arrangements for Mr Murtha. I am planning to attend, wherever it will be
(johnstown or arlington). Will let you know when I hear something. It's such a big loss for the community, the state and
the country. PA officials are talking about a special election on May 18th.
