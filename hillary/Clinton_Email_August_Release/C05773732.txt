Subject: North Korea

Following up on the discussion in yesterday's policy committee meeting about North Korea, I thought some of you might
be interested in the following articles:

"North Koreans Use Cell phones to Bare Secrets" New York Times
http://www. nytimes.com/2010/03/29/world/asia/29news.htm I

"North Korean man executed for calling a friend in South Korea on mobile phone"
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1255375/North-Korean-man-executed-callino-friend-South-Korea-
mobile-phone.html


I have also attached a very good article (translated) from a Korean publication which describes what is called the
"Information Belt" formed along the North Korea-China border.



Anybody with an appetite for more content, let me know and I'll send on high side.
Alec
