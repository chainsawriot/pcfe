Cheryl,




One sappy statement before I fly. Your involvement in the QDDR process has always been extremely helpful. Most of the
best QDDR chairs meetings were those in which you participated, due in large part to the rigor and critical thought you
brought to every issue. From the beginning of the process, your critical analysis and thoughtfulness in these meetings
made all of us think more deeply. I have been grateful for that approach many times throughout the QDDR.




We've come a long way since that first meeting in which I described this as a "capabilities review" and organizational

amount of positive feedback we've received and the eagerness to start implementation are great signs heading into
implementation.




You are clearly one of the hardest working people in this building and have done so much to define and implement the
Secretary's vision on so many things. So thanks for everything you've done on the QDDR and for everything else you do.




As discussed today, I'm not far away if you need anything.
