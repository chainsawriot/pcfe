Judith,

Can't remember whether I forwarded this stuff to you.

As you can see, our staff feel that the Dialogue went pretty well in the press — and it continues to do well. The Foreign
Minister -- now claiming credit for changing our TSA airport screening policy -- is promising to "take Parliament into
confidence" on the dialogue in the near future. I'm going to be out talking at a think tank on Weds; Holbrooke will be
here next week.

U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue Media Summary




The U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue dominated Pakistani media on March 24 and March 25. All major English and Urdu
language networks carried live the Secretary and Foreign Minister Qureshi's remarks at the opening session. On
Thursday morning, nearly all television networks led with coverage of the joint press availability. All major English and
Urdu language dailies featured the talks on their front pages, highlighting the Secretary's announcement of $125 million
in aid to Pakistan's energy sector. Reporting was straight-forward with favorable headlines: Dawn—"U.S, Pakistan
pledge to boost and broaden ties" and "U.S. to provide $125m for energy, power plants"; The News—"US vows to boost
energy, defence, trade ties"; Nawa-i-Waqt—"U.S. will neither abandon nor dictate to Pakistan"; The Nation—"New day'
for US, Pakistan: Hillary." Media highlighted the positive shift in U.S.-Pakistan relations, echoing Secretary Clinton's
statement that the talks are the beginning of a new chapter. Reports also focused on the question of nuclear
cooperation and U.S. engagement in the Kashmir dispute; however the U.S. position on these issues had been widely
reported by the media prior to the Dialogue. The Nation published an editorial, entitled "Negative starting note,"
criticizing the talks before they began. The daily stated that "promises will be made on some issues, including on nuclear
cooperation, which will not see fruition." Other editorials stressed the need for a sustained commitment on both sides,
beyond March 24, to produce results: Dawn – "Prospects for Pak-US ties," and Daily Times—"Pak-US Strategic
Dialogue." End Summary.
