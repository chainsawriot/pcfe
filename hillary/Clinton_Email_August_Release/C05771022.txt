I'm sorry -- we missed our window today. I shd have insisted we send you the draft we had as of 10 am this morning
rather than Sonni doing another round of edits so that you could have used valuable weekend time. We have a draft we
can send you now, but you should probably see it when you are fresh. Time got away from us; my apologies. AM
