Subject: Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan

Hello Jake: After consulting with Bob Blake and his team, and both our posts in the region, I'm planning to get out to
Uzbekistan and, if conditions permit, Kyrgyzstan in the next day or two to assess the humanitarian situation and the
assistance efforts of our partners, and to communicate our commitment to a generous response. The UN has just
issued appeals for each country, and we'll be contributing additional funds in the days ahead. My Deputy, David
Robinson, will be at the 9:15 meeting tomorrow (I have a congressional meeting) and will mention this to the Secretary —
but given her strong interest and her exchange with me on it on Monday — I thought I should give you a head's up. Best„
Eric
