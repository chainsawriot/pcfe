Nor do I. Its strange that it seems to be a recent problem with our emails, and there is no rhyme or reason to why some
go through and others don't. In the mean time, ill always confirm for you right away when I receive your emails, even if
an answer is still pending.

I did not. Very aggravating. There is some kind of disconnect. We are still waiting to hear back on mashabane's
availability. Nothing yet scheduled for tomorrow, but we still have menendez and alexander outstanding. Menendez's
staff owes us a call back. Alexander is free up until 1pm tomorrow.

Ok. Is the South African call scheduled yet? Are there any calls outstanding for today or tomorrow?
