KABUL (Reuters) - The United States does not know if the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed
by a drone strike earlier this week, a senior American envoy said January 16. "I've heard every conceivable version of
what's happened and I don't know." the U.S. Special Representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke said.
