Subject: MEPP prep materials

Sandy Berger told me that he and Steve Hadley had USIP prepare several papers, including a matrix prepared by Scott
Lacszinski(?) of everyone's position on every issue since Oslo. He thinks it would be helpful, and I agree. I'd like to see all
papers. Can you be sure I get copies? Thx.
