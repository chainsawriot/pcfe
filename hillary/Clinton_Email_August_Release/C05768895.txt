Haiti Donor Conference Update.


See below.

We have calls for you to call Qatar and UAE for funds (also on your call sheet was Saudis and Kuwait — have not seen
them register yet nor have they told our embassies yet).

Also — am going to head to Haiti for day on the CoDEL and sit with GOH on the development authority — just had long
convo with WJC.

Cheryl,
  Great turn out! 22 Ministers so far. Note the Cuban FM. Happy to see the Qatari PM/FM and UAE Minister of
State. Hopefully that means some money. Best, Roland
