Hi Cheryl -

I think we are in good shape right now so I won't bug you. We'll know more by Friday - when we learn whether
Reid files the cloture on Goodwin this week or whether he is waiting to file it until after Thanksgiving.

I'll keep you posted.

Thanks so much for all or your support!!

xxoo.

 Hi Cheryl -

 Goodwin is in DC and met with Reid's staff. It looks like he is really going to go ahead and file cloture!! See
 also the article from the BLT today.

 Goodwin also met with Feinstein, which was a difficult meeting. If you have time, I'd like to confidentially
 discuss with you. I can set my alarm to get up and talk to you at 6 or 6:30 a.m. in the morning your time if that
 is the best time to reach you. Are you still at

 Thanks!

 xxoo,

Democrats Plan Votes on Controversial Nominees, Senator Says

President Barack Obama's nominees for the federal judiciary have stalled for months in part because of heated
disagreement over a handful of nominees. Now, Senate Democrats are looking at forcing votes on four of
them.

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said today that Democrats could move soon to end debate on the nominees.
He said that Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) was lining up support this morning for what's known as a
cloture petition â€” the necessary paperwork before holding a vote to end debate.

"He's lining up the signatures," Whitehouse said after a meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Such a
petition requires 16 signatures.

Whitehouse is a vocal supporter of one of the nominees who have drawn fire: John McConnell Jr., a Motley
Rice partner who's been nominated for federal district court in Rhode Island. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce
is opposing McConnell's nomination, citing his work as a plaintiffs' lawyer on lead paint litigation and other
cases.

The other three nominees whom Reid is trying to force votes on, Whitehouse said, are Goodwin Liu for the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, Edward Chen for the Northern District of California and Louis
Butler for the Western District of Wisconsin. Republicans have targeted all three because of what they call the
nominees' extreme views, while the nominees' home-state senators and other supporters argue they're being
treated unfairly.

A fifth nominee whom Republicans oppose, Judge Robert Chatigny for the 2nd Circuit, is pending before the
Senate Judiciary Committee. A committee vote is planned for Thursday.

Though senators have many other priorities during their "lame duck" session, Whitehouse said he thinks there
is time to consider the stalled nominees. Otherwise, he said, "there'd be no point getting the signatures" for the
cloture petition.

Senate rules require 60 votes to end debate on a nominee or a bill, unless senators agree to waive a vote
entirely. Democrats control 59 Senate seats until January.

On Monday, conservatives sent a letter to Reid asking him not to force votes on any nominees between the
midterm elections and the start of the next Congress. "Any lame-duck' confirmations would be a gross abuse
of Congressional authority in a last gasp attempt to perpetuate an agenda that the American people have
already rejected," the letter says.
