Richard

3 bombs devastated the shrine of Data Ganjbakhsh (the most sacred Muslim place in all of South Asia, and the shrine S
was supposed to go to).- Aside from loss of life, this is a major blow to Pakistan. I recommend that you call Clureshi,
Nawaz and Pasha (who will be here tomorrow). This will either break Pakistanis or will get them into the fight. This
shrine is deeply tied to the foundation of Islam in Pakistan.
