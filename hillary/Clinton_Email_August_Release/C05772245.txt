Subject: (Reuters) Egypt urges EU to bolster US-led Mideast peace bid

PARIS (Reuters) - Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak urged Europe on August 30 to throw its weight behind U.S.-led
efforts to secure a peace agreement between Palestinians and Israelis.

    Mubarak discussed the matter with French President Nicolas Sarkozy before heading to Washington this week for the
first direct negotiations in 20 months. "The American administration needs strong backing from the European Union for
the peace process to continue," he said.
