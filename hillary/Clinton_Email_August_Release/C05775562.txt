Ready to talk at your convenience. Timing is somewhat flexible - we have to circulate to interagency on the 19th - but
the sooner we nail down decisions the better.

This is a challenge. I'll be ready to talk either later tonight or tomorrow. What's our time frame?

I hope you don't read any of this but I've given Huma a complete draft of QDDR plus four key docs:

The first is the decision memo you asked for; second is recommendations for reforming rather than eliminating 10
bureau; third and fourth are two alternative approaches to the major development initiatives (one is the standard
approach; the other is Cheryl's that she'd like to discuss with you).
