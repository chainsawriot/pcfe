This morning Majority Leader Reid convened an hour-long Senate leadership meeting to discuss the path
forward on health care reform. Particpating were Senators Baucus, Dodd, Harkin, Durbin, Schumer and
Murray.

Afterwards, Harkin and Durbin confirmed what has been suspected for a while - Senate Leadership has
decided to go the reconciliation route on health care reform. The House, they said, will first pass the
Senate bill after Senate leaders demonstrate to House leadership that they have the votes to pass
reconciliation in the Senate.
