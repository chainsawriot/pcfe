Sorry,
just seeing this.

Sanger has a blog item on the NYT site about the comment, but more of a political take in that if you run for president
again your opponents will pull the Brookings tape. And a couple of wingnut blogs asking why you don't just volunteer
more of your own money to taxes, and that you chose Brazil as a "socialist country that sides with our enemies as a
model.". But frankly, I had to look pretty hard to find that, I was the 19th person to read it. Not 19,000th. 19th.

Most coverage was either straightforward about the NSS, or your comments about the debt as a national security
problem.

But feedback I got was strong, people always always always love you in that format.

Getting good feedback on your remarks. The early stories look good, too. More than one person has asked me, did she
do all that off the cuff?

I'll leave Philippe to answer the tax the rich question, but I loved it.

Are you getting any feedback? How soon will FOX attack me for my "tax the rich" comments?
