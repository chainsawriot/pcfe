RAMALLAH (Reuters) - Palestinians held fast on to their threat to quit peace talks with Israel if settlement building does
not cease, giving a U.S. Middle East envoy a final chance to try to save the negotiations. "Of course we don't want to end
negotiations, we want to continue. But if colonization continues we will be forced to end them," Palestinian President
Abbas said. He added, "We will wait until after a meeting between Palestinians, and an Arab forum meeting on October
4 ... So Netanyahu has a week to decide."
