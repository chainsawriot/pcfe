They got cloture on DADT. 63 to 33.

At the close of the 30 hours (or when they yield back) we are back on START. We were able to convince Reid this
morning not to file cloture on the treaty, which would have played in to Kyl's hands. So we are likely to have one full
more day of debate and some votes on amendments, then file cloture setting up a cloture vote early next week. Mccain
and Graham are still in a grumpy place - Graham is worse than McCain and we may have lost him. But McCain is still
very much in the game.
