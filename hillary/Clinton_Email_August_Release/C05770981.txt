H: When Madeleine first became Secretary of State, I organized a group of people for her to discuss the anniversary of
the Marshall Plan to prepare her for her speech. Some were younger, but most were like                                         etc.
We had a long dinner. It was, I think, fruitful for her. (I recall Greg Craig there, then as head of Policy Planning.) There are
a lot of people not in government who have expertise and judgment that are not being tapped, some of them oun er.
There are of course a number of people who have not been tapped into the administration and wish to be.
             for example, is someone I've talked with recently, who very much wants to serve as an ambassador or in
some capacity.)                    , whom I mentioned, and whose CV                                                 I've included
below, is someone who is very knowledgeable, tough minded, has ideas, and is capable, in his 40s. He's the kind of
person who might be considered to succeed Anne-Marie Slaughter. There are others out there:                              for
example, who you may remember                                                                                s incredibly
effective, but has been kept out of this administration because as a lawyer he's had to register as a lobbyist. He's one of
many. Really counter-productive to develop such self-undermining rules.
                            thinks hard about diplomacy, and we've been in conversation about how to develop these ideas
further. I he younger generation is interesting,             is worth paying attention to, among them. More to discuss. Sid
