Subject: (AP) Israeli official: Hamas rockets can reach Tel Aviv

TEL AVIV (AP) â€” A senior Israeli intelligence official says llamas has rockets with a range of 50 miles, putting the coastal
metropolis of Tel Aviv within range of its launchers. The official blames Egypt, saying it is not doing enough to stem
smuggling through a network of tunnels along the relatively short border between its Sinai desert and the Gaza
Strip. The official said most of the tunnels were concentrated in an area no longer than 2.5 miles. "Egypt can stop all
this smuggling of weapons within 24 hours if they want to do it," the official said November 14, speaking on condition of
anonymity under Israeli security regulations. The official said, however, that intelligence cooperation with Egypt was
otherwise effective.
