Wow, that was fast - and great

Don't worry about the reporter reading the quotes back to you, we're recording and he'll have the transcript shortly. I'm
guessing we just caught him at a bad moment and he's not as flaky as he sounds

Subject: Reminder: WaPo Call re Bob Barnett

Gentle reminder about the Bob Barnett profile he emailed you about. Story is being written by David Montgomery of the
Washington Post, and is slated to run tomorrow - so we need to do this today, the earlier the better.

All you have to do is call into Ops when you're ready, they will connect you to the reporter (and add me in)



Here's the reporters description on the piece: "...a large profile of Bob Barnett for the Style section. I know Barnett has
been a friend and counselor and campaign supporter over the years. I would like to ask Secretary Clinton her estimation
of what makes Barnett good at what he does, what he has meant to her in the various ways he has worked for her over
the years. And I would like to ask what she makes of how such a committed Democrat as Barnett is able to work so well
in his professional life for noted Republicans on book projects and other work. (A theme of the piece is how some say
Barnett harkens to a mythic time in Washington when players supposedly could more readily have relationships with
other side, even while sticking to principles in their political work)"



You have talked about Bob many times, but general points:
