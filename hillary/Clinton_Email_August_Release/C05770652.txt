Let me ask Justin/Huma
And on Monday I'll set it up so that it has a near permanent Internet feed

I don't know if I have wi-fi. How do I find out?

Pulse - automatically updates when you open it. If you look to the left of each name of the news org, you'll initially see a
circle like symbol. That means it's updating.

Oh, actually the problem you are having is that it needs to find WiFi - do you have WiFi in whatever home you're in now?
We just need to set that up once and it will subsequently connect whenever it senses that wifi.

And yes on Monday can spend some quality time.

How do I get the Pulse to update? It still shows what it did when you first demo'd it for me.

Do I need to charge it? If so, how? I have no cords.

Does Huma now know enough to help? Can you show me on Monday?
