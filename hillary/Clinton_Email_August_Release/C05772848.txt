Quick summary of Burma elections:

While there was no independent election observation or monitoring of Burma's November 7 elections, anecdotal and
initial media reports suggest low to medium voter turnout. There were no major incidents that disrupted polling,
according to available information. The United States declined to participate in staged-Government of Burma (GOB) led
"election tours" as did EU missions. Though all signs point to a full victory for pro-regime parties, the GOB has not
announced election results yet and has not provided any clear indication of when it plans to do so. Opposition and exile
groups claim advance voting schemes are one indication of significant fraud and vote rigging. End Summary.
