According to post this info has not been confirmed. They report: "The judge said he's made a decision but that he will
not announce it until after he receives some paperwork. The next session is tomorrow and he may announce then."

Post is working to coordinate departure arrangements in case a decision to allow the two women to depart occurs
tomorrow.
