GAZA (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of supporters of the militant Islamic Jihad movement rallied in the streets of Gaza on
October 29, chanting "Death to America" and "Death to Israel." Young men and boys wearing white T-shirts with a
slogan in the shape of a rifle bore portraits of militants killed in combat, under the black flags of Islamic Jihad. Ramadan
Sheilah, the group's exiled chief in Damascus, sent a recorded message marking the anniversary of the assassination of
the group's leader Fathi Shiqaqi in Malta in 1995, by presumed Israeli secret agents. "Israel will not bring peace to the
region, it will only bring war and destruction and therefore, the slogan of all should be that Israel must be wiped out of
existence," said Shallah, who is on a United States wanted list. Senior leaders of the ruling Islamist group, Hamas, joined
the open-air gathering, the largest for years in honor of Islamic Jihad with up to 100,000 attending according to its
organizers. Hamas allowed the group to use city terrain it usually reserves exclusively for its own rallies, and Hamas
forces provided security for the parade by its smaller rival.
