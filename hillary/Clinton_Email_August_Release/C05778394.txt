Dear Huma and Jake:

If there is an appropriate way to do so, I wondered if you might convey to Secretary Clinton how much it meant to me
personally and to so many of us that she led us last night for cathartic story-telling and laughter. It was such a terrible
evening, but she managed to ignite warmth at a moment when everything felt frozen still. Her ability to lift us all up
after a trip to Canada, hosting a huge reception, and on top of her own loss, was itself a rallying cry to soldier on the way
Holbrooke would have insisted we do. She helped fill the tremendous sense of void with funny memories and an
appreciation of how deeply he touched so many of us. I felt better by the time I left, and still do.

Many thanks,

Suzanne
