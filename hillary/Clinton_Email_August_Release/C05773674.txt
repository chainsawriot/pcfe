Dear Melanne,

Thank you; We, group of women leaders met with Secretary Clinton. It was a short meeting, introduction and photo
opportunity. But, I hope the event send a message to our government that women should be supported. I also think
that the Embassy will consider more vision of women of Kosova.
Secretary Clinton was just remarkable. Her message for our, also Belgrade leadership was clear and strait forward;
dialogue, dialogue, dialogue as two independent states!
The admiration expressed by the population in the streets as motorcade was passing, meeting with PM and acting
President, open meeting with students and media was impressive. She is really inspiration for all.
Maybe was not a right time, but I only wish she has pressed the PM on corruption practices.
Thank you once again for facilitating this meeting.

Best regards,

Vjosa

Dear Melanne,

Hope this message finds you well.
I am trying to follow your work and every time I run into information that involves you as a speaker or presenter, I know
that strong advocacy for the benefit of women is coming for the future.

I am starting a foundation, with a objective to advocate policies on health, environment and human rights. Women in
the region have serious obstacles to access health care and services, and are suffering from a luck of information. Many
preventable diseases are taking its toll because of the lack of information and facilities, especially regarding breast
cancer and cervical cancer. Also, laws on health care do not require for preventive services such as mammography, pap
smear and other preventive services. I am planning to work on different level, not excluding other target groups but
starting with women.
Today, media have announce the visit of Secretary Hillary Clinton in the region, including Kosovo. Is there any chance to
meet with her during short visit in Prishtina? I know she is coming to assist the dialogue between Prishtina and
Belgrade, but she would be even more helpful if she meets me and other women.
New early elections are coming in few months and she would bust our confidence and would support better
participation of women and better election result.
I am afraid that our government officials are going to meet alone and/or be very selective who can meet her because is
going to have impact on the election.
I am not with any political party but would be wonderful and extremely helpful for the support of woman's agenda Is
any chance that you will be coming with Secretary Clinton?

Best regards,
Vjosa
