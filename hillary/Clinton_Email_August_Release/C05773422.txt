Re: NI/tactic works


The plan worked perfectly. Gordon made the speech in the late afternoon. Cameron felt compelled to support both the
deal and the timing. Shaun called Lou Susman beforehand and Susman made a helpful call to Cameron "seeking
clarification" an hour and a half before the event.

Now, Reg Empey is boxed in. He's considering his position. It may be that you will have to call him in a couple days.

Shaun will call you tomorrow at a time convenient to you.
