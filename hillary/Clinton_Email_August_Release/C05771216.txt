Vali--per your query, the cap I wore says "USAID from the People of the United States" and on the back "DART". It was
practically the only sign, however temporary, that there was a US civilian effort in Sindh. So it got some media attention,
which was good.
  Every other country's aid here, even Iran's, is better branded than us. Only our helicopters are visible. China's field
hospital (which I drove by in Thatta) Turkey, Saudi Arabia (I visited their refugee camp, where they are building a
mosque), Australia (field hospital in multan), Switzerland, UK, etc. While we hide and the NGO partners refuse to admit
that we fund them.

In addition, our employees are prevented from spending time in the affected areas, which they can visit only under very
stringent conditions and heavy security imposed by RSOs. For example, the fabled AID DART teamn can hardly get out of
l'bad and relies primarily on reports from NGois, a notably unreliable method.

We are going to try to change this. It won't be easy.

I don't know but there seems to be a lot of commentary about your cap; does it say something like a "gift from the US?"

Does that have deeper meaning, Dr Freud?

Seems like Pakistani press is taking particular interest in RCH baseball cap.
