YEREVAN (Reuters) â€” Armenia's ruling coalition said it had decided to freeze the ratification in parliament of accords
with Turkey aimed at normalizing ties between the historic foes.

"Considering the Turkish side's refusal to fulfill the requirement to ratify the accord without preconditions in a reasonable
time, making the continuation of the ratification process in the national parliament pointless, we consider it necessary to
suspend this process," the statement said.
