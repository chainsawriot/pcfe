GREAT! This should all be in the Sec State's short remar s - she will get a kick out of this I think. Some of her HUGEST

Subject: names for my swearing in

I would like the people in the cc line to be sent invitations to my swearing in - on the 18th of November. If I have forgotten
someone important please let me know. I am limited to 100 people so this is my A list. MAKE sure you say yes or no to
Andrew because I have another 50 people waiting in line! Thanks. Some I sent invites (like Fanta) just because I love
you - I know you cannot come but I wanted to invite you anyway.

For those of you who will be coming in from out of town, Andrew will ask you for certain information (needed for security
reasons).

Steve - send names of people you want invited with email addresses - I sent Sarah's already but not Diane or John H. or
Bill Livengood or Nickie.

Ambassdor T-Greenfield please forward to Deuce - I do not have his email (I thought I did).

Andrew this list does NOT include the MUST invites like Ambassador Carson, Amb Yamamoto, Undersecretary Patrick
Kennedy and Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills (SHE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME). AND of course Administrator Shah.




Patrick and Kris - if Robbie or Fred want to come FINE - send their emails to Andrew but ONLY if they are really coming.
Pam White
USAID Director/Liberia
