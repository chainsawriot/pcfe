 Subject: Haiti Conference Call.

 Dear Margo,

 I am writing you on behalf of Cristina Barrios, the Spanish Special Ambassador for the Reconstruction of Haiti. She
 participated yesterday in the Conference Call on behalf of Spain.

 We were told to send you Ms. Barrios contact details so that we can be included in the distribution lists for the
 Conference call and the other preparations, and then be able to receive the different documents, plans, templates, etc.
 that are being distributed to all the participants. In particular, the WB MDTF-related documentation as well as templates
 for the different outreach meetings and whatever items everybody else is receiving. These are her contact details:

 Ms. Cristina Barrios,
 Special Ambassador for the Reconstruction of Haiti
 Spain
                                                                                                                                 B6



 We look forward to receiving the Agenda for Feb. 25th at 1600 (European time) and any related documents to be
 distributed.
