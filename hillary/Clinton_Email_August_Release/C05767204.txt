I confess that I will never understand how Shaun decides when to call me, DecIan, Lou Susman, or Sid with breaking

We've been hearing all day that Peter would take a back-me-or-sack-me public vote of his party. Hopefully tomorrow
will be the day -- and hopefully he'll be successful.

In an interesting show of strength, he has announced he'll resume as First Minister.

to sell it tomorrow. He has told Shaun and Gordon he believes he can do it. He needs 75 percent of his party. So, the
perils of peace continue.
