Dear Hillary,

I just arrived back but my heart and mind are back in Haiti   I am thankful that you helped me get there and supported
the resurrection of the hospital in just one week. General Keen was key in reestablishing the hospital (and I got to
appreciate MRE's). When we got there there were 1500 patients and 400 corpses in a deserted hospital — our team of 7
was the only group there.... And slowly over the week we have built a functioning hospital again.

Meeting and working with Paul has been good for the soul---- although when I felt I wanted to meet him – this was not
the way...But I think I am in this for the long haul...

Below is an email for President Clinton (it was good to see him and Chelsea and Mark there) I promised to forward this
email by a medical student he spoke to in the operating room .... Desperate to find a way to continue his education.
Attached is picture of him and I in front of the surgery area. And there were 3 more I met a few nights later who had
volunteered since the first days but had not eaten in a week (I managed to gather bag of biscuits from the world food
program from behind 3 padlocks after 1 hours of searching – They slept on the hospital grounds because their homes
were destroyed.

I am not sure what we can do... But I promised to pass this on!

Thank you for who you are in the world.. God bless you!

Your friend in gratitude,

Mark

As you know, all the universities are broken, so now we get no way to continue our education... And we are with our
family in the streets, so life is become more difficult as we never imagine.... I know that the USA used to help Haiti with
Scholarship, but is really sad to tell you that the kind of young man as me, never get chance to benefice a scholarship,
just because we are in the last categories in the society (the poor persons)....So, In that Situation we need your help
more than ever, Please, please, please M. President we are "3" friends are helping in the hospital since after the
catastrophe, and now we are thinking about how to continue to sturdy, So Please, please, please help us have a
scholarship in USA... And we promiss to come back after to teach, and help the orders... God will Bless you for that M.
President because we are really, really, really in need...
Thank you so much to gave me a chance to talk to you, when you was in the country, and thank you for reading this
