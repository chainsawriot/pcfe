week. EUR has made request that you place a condolence call to FM Papandreou this weekend. The week is going to be
tough politically and personally for the FM. The Minister of Citizens Protection has resigned as a result of the protests
and deaths. let me know if u want to.
Also, we have abdullah call for either tomorrow or monday. Waiting fo them to get back to us.
