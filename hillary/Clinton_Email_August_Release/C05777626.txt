Melanne,
I got through to my Norwegian counterpart here                                  and she told me that the Norwegian
Foreign Ministry is working on the text of a statement that Oslo hopes to issue today. She was very worried that Norway
had somehow end up catalyzing unjustified attacks on             and thought it important that Oslo set the record      1.4(D)
straight. She believed the statement would be short and concise. She encouraged us to raise the issue also in Oslo. The B1
phone connection was a little shaky, but I think she mentioned that her Minister would be in Washington over the next
couple of days.
Aloha,
Jim

I hope the Norwegians prove helpful. So far, however, the lower levels wouldn't tell us anything of importance, and I'm
having a little difficulty getting through to my counterpart.
Aloha

Very interesting, Jim. First of all, my apologies for not linking up by phone. I'm at the Eu and there was no way in the
midst of events here to take a call.
It was far too late to call when I was freed up.
                                                                                                                            B5

The pain he is feeling is palpable.
