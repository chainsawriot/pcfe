Subject: (Reuters) Sarkozy calls for October MidEast talks in Paris

PARIS (Reuters) - French President Sarkozy said he would ask Palestinian President Abbas, Israeli PM Netanyahu, and
Egyptian President Mubarak to peace talks in Paris before the end of October. Abbas said the construction of Jewish
settlements, subject of a moratorium that expired on September 26, should be frozen for another 3-4 months, a position
Sarkozy backed as crucial. "The settlements must stop," the French president said.
