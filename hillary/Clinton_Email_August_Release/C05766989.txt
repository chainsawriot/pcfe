Subject: Posner response to Washington Post editorial

Philippe and Jake asked me to send along this response to the Washington Post editorial:




By Michael Posner




The Post's Dec. 27 editorial ("Redefining Human Rights") on the Obama Administration's human rights and democracy
policies, and Secretary Clinton's recent speech at Georgetown in particular, misses the critical point: human rights,
democracy, and development are mutually reinforcing, not competing goals. They complement each other in the task of
making human rights a human reality.




President Roosevelt understood the fundamental link between liberty, prosperity and security, tying together freedom
of speech and worship with freedom from want and freedom from fear in his famous "Four Freedoms" speech. At
Georgetown, Secretary Clinton articulated a 21st century vision grounded in this wisdom.




To accuse Secretary Clinton of embracing a Soviet-bloc approach to human rights because she includes development in a
discussion of democracy not only strains the bonds of credulity and common sense, it also walls off a crucial avenue for
ensuring that people can actually exercise the rights that are naturally theirs - including the rights to freedom of religion,
association, and speech-in their daily lives.

As Secretary Clinton made clear, policies that address development alone are not adequate: "Freedom doesn't come in
half measures, and partial remedies will not solve the whole problem," she said. But experience shows us that where
broad-based development occurs, people are more likely to demand a say in securing their futures, and governments
are more likely to have the resources to maintain the strong institutions, including reliable police and fair courts, that
help ensure the consistent protection of rights. Where people are given the right to speak freely, to participate in their
nation's political process and have access to basic information about government, sustainable development is more
likely to occur. At the same time, democracies without development do not last. These are mutually reinforcing tracks,
and the Obama Administration is committed to pursuing both simultaneously.




As President Obama said in his Nobel lecture, "engagement with repressive regimes lacks the satisfying purity of
indignation." But the Post's overheated outrage ignores the lessons learned by generations of men and women who
worked to advance human rights around the world.




To suggest that Secretary Clinton somehow provided excuses to rights-abusing dictators in a speech in which she
forcefully criticized specific abuses across the world, is simply not credible. Far from being an excuse for any regime, this
is an approach that pushes governments to do more to advance civil and political rights and to ensure that democracy
actually delivers a measure of prosperity and opportunity for all. That is the right approach for the Obama
Administration and for the 21st century.
