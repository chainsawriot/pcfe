I thought your designation of Iran as a near military government was very good. Gary Sick has been arguing that it is in
fact a military government. Of course this is predicate for targeted sanctions. There is a consistent thread in the
challenges we face from a host of authoritarian (and totalitarian) military governments, sometimes loosely allied on an ad
hoc basis--Iran, China, Myanmar, Venezuela, Cuba. This is nothing like the Cold War, but it's an idea worth exploring, not
publicly discussing, but thinking about.

On Justice Jim, a couple of thoughts: I wish his tragic end were as politically conclusive as that of Edmund Ruffin, the
Southern fire-eater and secessionist who was given the honor of firing the first shot at Fort Sumter and upon hearing of
Appomattox carefully sat himself down in his grand Charleston house and blew his brains out with a shotgun.
Unfortunately, the evil Justice Jim did lives on--in the wild bigotry against Obama and even through the Supreme Court
decision in the case of Citizens United, a group he helped galvanize to circulate the Whitewater hoax.

Supreme Court Justice Jim Johnson, known both for his segregationist political

activities in the 1950s and dabbling in the political campaign against Bill

Clinton during his presidency, died yesterday.



A Faulkner County sheriff's office spokesman, Lt. Matt Rice, said Johnson was

found dead in his home about 10 a.m. Saturday with an apparently self-inflicted

chest wound from a .30-30 rifle. Johnson had been beset by medical problems, he

said. Roller-McNutt Funeral Home in Conway will be handling arrangements.



He was 85. Here's a standard biographical history

. This will end his prolific and pointed letters to the editor (unless some are

still in the pipeline), delivered on stationery marked with his name for his

Conway home, "White Haven."



Justice Jim was a courtly man and lively company, gracious in social interaction

with friend and political foe. But Mark Anthony's words in Julius Caesar about

men's deeds come, unavoidably, to mind. As recently as 1990, he worked in an

effort to preserve state Amendment 44, the states rights amendment aimed at

curbing integration that was his brainchild. It had long been declared

unconstitutional by federal courts and was barely repealed by voters.
