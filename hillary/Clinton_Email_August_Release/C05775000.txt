Lynn--

  I would love to see you but your days overlap w Karzai's visit so I will have to get that settled before I can confirm a
time but let's make it happen. So I'm copying Lona and Huma so we can start planning. Much love, H

Hi Hillary,

I am back from the unpredictable and exciting elections in Britain.

Congratulations on all the good things you are doing at State.

You have so many fans from Manmohan Singh, who smiled broadly when we talked about you, to those women who
never stop dreaming.

I would love to catch up. I have to be in DC from the 12th-15th May, in case you have any time to sneak away for a few
minutes.

I understand it may not be possible, but thought I would check.

In any event, I remain your loyal adoring pal.

Xoxox

Lynn
