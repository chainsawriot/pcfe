Subject: Sudan withdraws from Darfur peace talks (AP)

DOHA (AP) - A Sudanese official said his government has withdrawn from peace talks with Darfur rebel
groups, but it is still committed to making peace. Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir threatened to call off the
talks in Qatar and return negotiations to Sudan if agreement was not reached by December 30, and he carried
out his threat. Chief government negotiator Ghazi Salaheddine said the Sudanese delegation will leave for
Khartoum December 31. Ahmed Hussain Adam, a rebel spokesman, described the move as "a declaration of
war" in remarks to Al-Jazeera TV.
