Spoke to both Condi Rice and Jim Baker this afternoon re START op-ed. Condi said she plans her own op-ed, arguing in
favor of treaty ratification, due out in next few days. She asked that I tell the Secretary again that she'll be supportive.




Baker said he agreed that things were breaking the right way on the Hill, and shared the view that ratification before the
holidays is an increasing possibility. He was glad to have done the op-ed (even while complaining mildly about how
much effort it took to "herd the cats" to get it out), and hopeful of its effect.

Bill
