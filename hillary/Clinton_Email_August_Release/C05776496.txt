ASSANGE

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's highest court has refused permission to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange to appeal
against an arrest order issued over alleged sexual crimes, the court said on December 2. Assange's lawyer had this week
appealed against an arrest warrant, which has also led to an Interpol notice. Assange has denied the allegations. The
court decision means the domestic and international arrest warrants still stand.
