Our mission to the OECD wants to announce USG support for Angel Gurria's reappointment at OECD Secretary
General. Bob and Froman both support. Most other countries have already said they support; there are no other
candidates; and the OECD has never not given a SG a second term. Nobody in the USG has raised objections. Just
wanted to flag for you in case you had concerns.
