TEHRAN (AP) - Iran's recently fired foreign minister told a local news agency that he had not been aware of
plans to remove him from his post when he left on a mission to west Africa. Manouchehr Mottaki told Mehr
news agency, in a report issued December 19, that he was "never informed" about the dismissal while on his
trip. MonaIci called the dismissal during the mission "un-diplomatic and offensive."
