Subject:                      your legacy



I just want to say that as I brief the QDDR (20 times and counting), one of the points that makes
the strongest impression, and that I frankly think is an enormous part of your intellectual and
practical legacy, is putting together all the bureaus that focus on protecting individuals — protecting
them from insurgent or criminal violence (CCO and INL), protecting their rights through law
(DRL, GTIP, S/WCI), or meeting their basic needs in humanitarian emergencies (PRM). It is a
major statement about the direction that the world is going and we must follow. This was really
your idea, and it is a powerful one. I know your decision today and applaud it. AM
