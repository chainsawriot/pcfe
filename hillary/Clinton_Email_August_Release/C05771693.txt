Subject: (Reuters) Israel says Iranian reactor use "totally unacceptable"

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel said on August 21 the fueling up of Iran's first nuclear power plant was "totally
unacceptable" and urged more world pressure to force Tehran to cease any uranium enrichment. Israeli Foreign
Ministry spokesman Yossi Levy said in a statement: "It is totally unacceptable that a country that so blatantly violates
(international treaties) should enjoy the fruits of using nuclear energy."
