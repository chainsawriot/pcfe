Madam Secretary-

It looks like the 24 MEU is headed ashore this weekend after all. Col Petronzio asked me to join him and I'm flying down
tomorrow to link-up with them and should be on the ground in Haiti by Sunday. Radha is coming with me and I have no
idea what we will be doing, I just hope that we are able to make ourselves as useful as possible.
