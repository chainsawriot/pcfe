Subject: (AP) Iraqi PM on the defense in WikiLeaks release

BAGHDAD (AP) - Iraq's prime minister is accusing WikiLeaks of releasing documents that detail prisoner abuse by Iraqi
security forces to sabotage his re-election hopes.
   A statement released October 23 by Prime Minister Nouni al-Maliki's office said the timing of the documents' release
raises questions about whether it was motivated by politics.
  The statement said the documents show no proof of any improper treatment of detainees while al-Maliki has been at
the helm of the Iraqi government.
   It said he has taken a tough stance against terrorists but offered no details.
