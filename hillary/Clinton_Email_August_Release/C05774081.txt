Subject: 1st known case of a successful social media campaign in Syria

When Jared and I went to Syria, it was because we knew that Syrian society was growing increasingly young (population
will double in 17 years) and digital and that this was going to create disruptions in society that we could potential
harness for our purposes.

In what is the 1st of what I predict will be many interesting cases in the future, this past week a campaign went viral on
Facebook in Syria (even though Facebook is outlawed in Syria it is widely accessed through proxies) showing teachers in
Syria abusing their pupils. Thousands of Syrians made public their support on Facebook (the fact that people made their
identities known is notable) for the campaign to remove these teachers, and the Ministry of Education intervened and
fired the teachers.

This is the first known case of a successful social media campaign in Syria.

More will come.
