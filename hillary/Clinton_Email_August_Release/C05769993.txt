Subject                          2 passages from maiden speech of Britain's new sec for development



Overall the speech is worth reading; if you like I'll have it put in your weekend book. 2 passages
particularly worth noting.

   1. "Across the Atlantic, Hilary Clinton has pledged to put women 'front and center' of the American development

       agenda. That is the right choice. As David Cameron and Jeff Sachs argued earlier this year, women can hold the

       key to development in the world's poorest countries — in education, enterprise, micro-finance and healthcare.

       Investing in women pays dividends throughout the entire community."

   2. "I see DFID as a key, joined-up, integrated department, a bright star in the Whitehall constellation, a department

       of state for development in the developing world. That's why DFID has a seat at the Cabinet table and it's why I

       won't be satisfied until our message rings down the corridors of each and every department in Whitehall."

   We obviously don't love the "dept of state for development language," but what is most
   noteworthy is his emphasis on "joined-up" and "integrated" dept — underlining the fact that
   DFID as a separate cabinet department has been almost divorced from the rest of the
   government.
