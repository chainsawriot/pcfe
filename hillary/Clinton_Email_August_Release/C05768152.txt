Subject: (AP) UK's Brown to miss Obama nuclear summit in D.C.

LONDON (AP) - President Barack Obama's planned nuclear summit in Washington next week will go on without Britain's
leader. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has told Obama he'll be staying in London to concentrate on a hotly
contested May election. Brown told Obama in a phone call that he will send Foreign Secretary David Miliband to
represent Britain at the April 12-13 meeting. Obama is hosting dozens of world leaders to discuss the spread of atomic
weapons and the threat of nuclear terrorism. Brown's Labour Party is seeking a fourth term in office but the opposition
Conservatives are ahead in the polls and favored to take power for the first time since 1997.
