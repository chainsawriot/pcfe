Spoke to Joe and he is on board and all set re IFI. One concern is that Trini Vargo (frmr EMK staffer) is trying to redirect
money from IFI to her Irish Am Alliance for Mitchell scholarships. She will not succeed.

We'll work it out.

Just a quick note to tell you that we are moving forward on the Expo funding. All came in at $500k, McGraw Hill at
$200k, Intel at $250k more, Delos Living (a Mantz client) $250k, and CITI at a minimum of $2M brings us down to $3.7M.

The following are on deck and likely to come in soon - Boeing (more), Carlyle, Blackstone, Alcoa, and AECOM. EB and I
chatting with many others.
