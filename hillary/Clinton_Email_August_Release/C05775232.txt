Let's hear it for the nuns--I knew when they came out, the die was cast and Bart would get his knuckles rapped. Now,
let's wrap this up in the Senate and go drink something unhealthy! All your AIPAC friends told me you're doing well so
take care and keep going--w the wind at you back and my fervent cheers--Hillary

Whew once again u are in the thick of thing--- but didn't it make your heart feel good about the passage of. Health.
Care----and. The. Nuns pushed it over the finish line----as usual in the fcore front of. Social. Justice and a daring
willingness. To break with the. Boys     if you need a tonic. Go to the. Nuns exhibit @ the. Smithsonian--- Ripley.
Center. Gives the 250 year history of. Nuns in. Usa. And their role in shaping. Our country and producing 1000s of
women leaders with names like. Pelosi. Mikulski. Ferrar0. Sebilius.           takes less than a hour. You are doing great
