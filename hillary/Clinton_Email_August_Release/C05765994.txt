Good question. Strobe will know the answer on good sounding boards. I know that he spends a fair amount of time
with nonpro/arms control types of all stripes. I will check in with him.

Do we have any independent third opinion we can ask for advice?

As I mentioned, you will be receiving a binder of NPR documents tonight. I mischaracterized the structure of the binder.
The cover note is merely an extended table of contents, and behind it are six 2- or 3-pagers on the six major questions
on which they seek your guidance. The papers are technical, and some are easier to read than others, but it is worth aâ€¢
quick scan tonight before they march through them tomorrow.
