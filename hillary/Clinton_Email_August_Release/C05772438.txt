 STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON

 Release of Sarah Shourd

 I welcome Sarah Shourd's release from detention in Iran, and am pleased that she will soon be reunited with her
 family. I appreciate the efforts of all those who have worked for her release, in particular the Swiss Protecting Power in
 Tehran, the Omani Government, and the many other world leaders who have raised this case and the cases of other
 detained or missing American citizens. Sarah's fiancé Shane Bauer, Joshua Fattal, and other U.S. citizens remain detained
 or missing in Iran. We urge Iranian authorities to extend the same consideration to them by resolving their cases
 without delay and allowing them to immediately return to their families.
