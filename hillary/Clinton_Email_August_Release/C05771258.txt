Subject: (AP) Oman: No plans to free two other Americans in Iran

MUSCAT (AP) - Oman's foreign minister says he's not aware of any current plans for Iran to release two other Americans
still being held there but that his country is willing to act as an intermediary between Tehran and Washington. Oman
played a key role in helping mediate the release of American Sarah Shourd from Iran. Two other Americans with whom
she was arrested last year are still being held in Tehran on espionage charges. Oman's foreign minister, Yusuf bin Alawai
bin Abdullah, said by phone that there are "great possibilities" in repairing relations between the United States and
Iran. To help restore ties, he urged American officials to tone down what is seen as harsh rhetoric directed at Iran.
