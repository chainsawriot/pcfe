Subject: (AP) Report: Kyrgyz protesters kill interior minister

BISHKEK (AP) - An opposition member in Kyrgyzstan says a mob of angry protesters beat up the Central Asian nation's
interior minister, who died shortly afterward. Opposition activist Shamil Murat told The Associated Press that he saw
the dead body of Minister Moldomusa Kongatiyev in a government building in the western town of Talas. Murat said
the protesters in Talas who seized a police headquarters on the second day of anti-government rallies beat up
Kongatiyev and forced him to order his subordinates in the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek to stop a crackdown on an
opposition rally there. Police in Bishkek opened fire earlier April 7 on the protesters and an opposition leader said at
least 17 were killed. Protesters in Bishkek also stormed the building of the state-owned television company.
