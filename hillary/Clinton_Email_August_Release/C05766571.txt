Subject: SV: Congratulations

Dear Todd, thank you for this - and for our cooperation throughout. No, it has not been easy and I sense also a bit of the
struggle you have been thorugh in your end. And it is not over yet. You will need to get your legislation done - and we
shall have to transform a fragile Copenhagen Accord into a strong working instrument for global action on climate
change. All to be accomplished before June.

I look forward to be part of this drive and to be cooperating with you and your team in this regard. May be useful to
touch base early in January to assess way ahead.

Meanwhile, I want to assure you how much also I have come to appreciate the way you have been going about all of
this. In a world and through some intense months, weeks and days where not everybody has always played cards
openly, I have felt you to be one relayable force with an integrety and credibility that I never had reason to question.
                                                                                                                     B1
Next time, I shall bring a book - as a token of friedship!                                                           1.4(B)
                                                                                                                     1.4(D)
All the best. Hope you get some rest over the Christmas

painful as it was in the last few days, your biggest bets paid off. You were the MVP (Most Valuable Player to non
American sports fans).

Beyond all that, it has been the greatest pleasure to get to know you and to work with you. I greatly value our friendship
and hope we can keep it up. Thank you so much for all ypu have done for us and for your unfailing warm friendship to
me.

Now please take some time off!

Warmest regards, Todd

p.s. I've just heard our flight cancelled. We're trying to make other arrangements now, but may end up stuck here all
day. If so, I'll let you know in case you'd like to have a meal or coffee or take a walk. But I of course understand that
you'll probably be ensconced with family and happy NOT to be dealing with climate negotiators!
