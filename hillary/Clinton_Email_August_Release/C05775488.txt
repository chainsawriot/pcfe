GUADALAJARA (AP) - Public safety officials in Mexico said gunmen ambushed a convoy of 20 police officers, killing nine
of them and leaving one missing. The officials in Jalisco state said ten officers who survived the attack fought an hours-
long battle with the unknown attackers, and several gunmen were wounded. The attackers, who were riding in about
ten sport utility vehicles, were armed with grenades and assault rifles. They fled into neighboring Michoacan state after
the attack. Michoacan is the home to a violent cartel known to launch fierce attacks on police convoys.
