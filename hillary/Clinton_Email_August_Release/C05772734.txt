Phil-

The Secretary's messages at the meeting were outstanding, from OHR's point of view. lnzko is elated - particular with her
firm support for 5+2 and for judicious use of Bonn Powers (BP). Other than from the U.S., and usually from the UK, there
has been, at most, strong reluctance in the Quint to support BP use -- even when there are direct challenges to Dayton
and the functionality of the BH state. We have also sensed some Quint backsliding on 5+2. Although he missed the
opportunity you gave him to make the pitch directly, he later asked me to convey to you his hope that the Secretary would
be willing to help shore up European support for 5+2 and BP with key PIC colleagues -- especially from Quint countries
(Germany, France, Italy in particular). We certainly foresee a need to employ BP on the State Property issue, unless
Dodik abruptly alters course. Inzko is grateful as well to the Secretary for her offer to speak with Lady Ashton.

Many thanks and best regards, Rod
