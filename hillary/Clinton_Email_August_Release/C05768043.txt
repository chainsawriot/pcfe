Thank you so much Cheryl and no you did not! The conference looked great yesterday and the read out, congrats to all
of you for a great event. On the video, just hope it got to a point where you were happy with it. That said, I also wanted
to say that the streaming on State.gov and America.gov went very well yesterday and received a lot more praise then
the UN one which required people to download software, which ours did not. :)

Also, we are working now to send the video out to posts and to let them use in their own story telling. Also, we had a
gadget created to help promote the event which has been featured on several sites and we are continuing to push out
which encourages people to keep up to date on news on Haiti and to donate to the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund.

Best, Katie

I wanted to say thank you for all the work you put in to make the Haiti conference a success - your work - especially on
the video (Katie I know I nearly drove you crazy) and on helping the web experience and streaming experience work was
on display and much appreciated.

In case you don't know, this is one of the mosr successful donor conferences ever so thank you for helping Haiti and the
dept make history.

Best
Cdm
