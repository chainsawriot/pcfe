Subject: Tomorrow's meeting with human rights ngos

I tried to get them to switch the agenda to include Egypt instead of China — they are determined to raise China but we
agreed that it will come last — so right now there will be a quick mention of Egypt at the top by Elisa Massimino from
Human Rights First (who will open the meeting and serve as traffic cop). Then Karen Ryan from the Carter Center will
raise DRC, followed by Ken Roth of Human Rights Watch who will raise Af/Pak issues, then David Kramer (former A/S in
DRL now at Freedom House) raising China issues. The goal is to allow 15 minutes at the end for S (along with Dan Friend
and Harold ) to raise Gitmo issues and ask for their support. We now have 45 minutes for the meeting
