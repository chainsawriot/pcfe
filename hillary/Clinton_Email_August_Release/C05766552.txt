I just sent talking points to Huma regarding your interview with Mark Landler on the Shanghai Expo




Sorry I had to miss the Senate office festivities at Tamera's last night. Heard it was great.

Merry Christmas to you and Chelsea and the President. Your family has been wonderful to me and my family over the
years. Thank you.

Kris
