Jake:

I understand that Cannon told S they were still weighing the level of their participation because Micheletti had stepped
"sideways but not down." That's a nice metaphor, but a little misleading. Micheletti took " a leave of absence." That is
a legal construct to protect himself from prosecution (coup-related) since there is no amnesty yet. But he is gone from
the Presidential Palace and has promised not to speak out.

I think Canada will send its Minister of State for the Americas, Peter Kent. That's a serious level.
