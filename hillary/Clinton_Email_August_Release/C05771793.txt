Subject: (AP) Lebanese PM seeks support in Iran visit

TEHRAN (AP) - Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri expressed concerns for stability in the Middle East as he began a visit to
Tehran November 27 to rally Iran's support for his efforts to keep Lebanon stable amid tensions over a UN probe into
the assassination of his father, Rath( Hariri.
  The visit follows President Ahmadinejad's October tour of Lebanon, during which the Iranian leader reinforced
Tehran's ties to the Lebanese militant Hezbollah group, a longtime protege of the Shiite powerhouse.
  The exuberant welcome the Shiite Hezbollah staged for Ahmadinejad in Lebanon threw Hariri's Western-backed
factions in the government on the defensive.
  After touchdown in Tehran, Hariri was greeted by Iran's Vice President Mohammad Reza Rahimi and reviewed an
honor guard before heading in to meetings.
