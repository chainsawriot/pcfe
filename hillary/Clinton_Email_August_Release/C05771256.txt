  USS IWO JIMA DEPLOYS TO HAITI AS TROPICAL STORM APPROACHES

  MIAMI - U.S. Southern Command directed the amphibious ship USS Iwo Jima
  (LHD 7) to steam toward Haiti today in preparation for the forecasted
  arrival of tropical storm Tomas later this week.

  Iwo Jima will deploy to Haiti from Suriname, where it arrived Thursday
  on its final country visit for Continuing Promise 2010, a four-month,
  humanitarian civic assistance deployment to eight nations in the
  Caribbean region. The ship is scheduled to arrive in Haiti later this
  week.

  Large amphibious ships, like Iwo Jima, resemble small aircraft carriers
  and include the ability to support helicopter and landing craft
  operations to quickly move personnel and cargo, making it an ideal
  platform to support humanitarian-relief missions on short notice.

  A crew of 1,600 military and civilian medical, engineering, aviation,
  logistical and other support personnel are embarked aboard Iwo Jima,
  including U.S. Navy engineers, a contingent of 500 Marines with
  logistical-support expertise, volunteers from the U.S. Public Health
  Service and various non-governmental organizations (NG05), as well as
  medical, dental and engineering professionals from Europe, North America
  and South America.

  Eight CH-46 Sea Knight, medium-lift, dual-rotor helicopters; two MH-60
  Knight Hawk helicopters and two amphibious landing craft units (LCU's)
  are on Iwo Jima to support the ship's operations.

  Iwo Jima is a Wasp-class amphibious ship capable of speeds in excess of
  20 knots that can provide robust ship-to-shore, as well as
  shore-to-shore logistics support during contingencies ranging from
  traditional military operations to humanitarian and disaster-relief
  missions.

  Because of the Caribbean region's history of severe-weather- events
  during the peak months of the hurricane season, the ship has remained in
  the area throughout its present deployment, ready to support U.S.
  disaster relief efforts when directed.

  Iwo Jima was in Port-de-Paix, Haiti, from July 24 through Aug. 3. It was
  the first stop on CP10 and the crew provided medical assistance to more
  than 4,000 Haitian citizens, performed 32 surgeries, completed six
  engineering projects, and delivered 231 pallets of
  humanitarian-assistanCe supplies donated by NG0s.

   In September 2008, the amphibious ship USS Kearsarge deployed to Haiti
