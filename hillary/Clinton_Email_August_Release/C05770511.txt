Subject: Letter from and Meeting with Afghan Minister of Labor, Social Affiars, Martyrs and Disabled

Dear Madam Secretary,

Minister Afzali of the Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs, Martyrs and Disabled (MOLSA) is working hard in her new role as
the only confirmed female minister within the Government of Afghanistan. MOLSA has been under-resourced by the
international community and the USG, and while we are not shifting significant funds to her ministry, we have
undertaken a high-payoff, focused program of mentoring and policy advice.

Minister Afzali views you as a role model and seeks your mentorship & support. She has explained some of her priorities
in the attached correspondence and would like to meet briefly with you at the Kabul Conference, a meeting. Time
permitting, we would recommend a brief session with some international and Afghan media present. Perhaps at some
point Secretary Solis can visit here and deepen the partnership with Minister Afzali.

Respectfully,

Karl
