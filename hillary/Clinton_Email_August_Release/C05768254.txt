BELFAST - (AP) Northern Ireland's Catholic and Protestant lawmakers have appointed their first justice minister, a
power-sharing landmark that IRA dissidents protested by bombing the local base of Britain's .spy agency MI5. David Ford
received support in the Northern Ireland Assembly from both the Protestants of the Democratic Unionists and the
Catholics of Sinn Fein, who jointly lead the province's three-year-old administration. The Democratic Unionists and Sinn
Fein spent years negotiating terms for receiving control of Northern Ireland's justice system from Britain. Their
compromise candidate, Ford, leads a small party called Alliance that seeks votes equally from both sides of the
community. Ford denounced Monday's bombing, in which no one was injured, as pointless.
