Cheryl, I thought the meeting and the press conference went well.

Below is an interesting analysis done by Doug Mercado that relates to one of the questions you were asked about the
flash appeal. Good background (for when you have a minute), as well as a reminder that there is a great deal of liquidity
in the NGO community that needs creative guidance.

Please let us know if there is anything you need.


Best, Rick

Hi All,

Just to put this into perspective....yes, the UN Flash Appeal for Haiti is only funded at 48% ($718 million). Just for
comparison, here are figures for other UN humanitarian appeals: DRC is funded at 5%, Sudan at 23%, Afghanistan at
31%, Kenya at 18%, Chad at 4%. Clearly, not all disasters/responses are the same. Perhaps the scenario that most
closely approximates the needs generated by the Haiti earthquake is that of the Indian Ocean tsunami
(2004/2005). Oddly enough, the UN Flash Appeal for the Indian Ocean Tsunami ran to $1.4 billion (the exact same figure
as for the Haiti Flash Appeal). In the end, the UN humanitarian appeal for the Indian Ocean tsunami stood at $1.2 billion
 (a coverage rate of 85%). In the worst of disasters, the funding for UN humanitarian appeals never reaches 100%.

We should not forget that there is an enormous amount of money being funneled through channels outside the UN
appeal system. For example, the Red Cross movement (including IFRC, ICRC and the national societies) has raised
between $700 and $800 million for Haiti. The American Red Cross alone raised $400 million (they project that it will
take them five years to spend this money on relief and recovery activities in Haiti). InterAction, the consortium of US-
based NGOs has announced that its members have raised nearly $700 million for relief and early recovery activities in
Haiti. I met with two NGOs today: OXFAM has raised over $100 million. World Vision has raised $250 million
specifically for its earthquake response in Haiti (on top of its regular budget of $50 million for Haiti). We haven't been
able to get reliable figures on what non-US NGOs have raised, but I would imagine it to be considerable (at least over
$500 million as a conservative estimate).

                                                                                                     Clearly, there is an
enormous amount of money raised for Haiti relief and recovery efforts through the UN system and outside the UN
system. The challenge is to get an accurate tally of the funding available from UN agencies, lOs and NGOs (perhaps a
tasking for the OSE and/or OCHA) and maximize coordination among the various agencies holding this money to
improve allocation of resources. There very well may be underfunded sectors and overfunded sectors in terms of the
humanitarian response. Information sharing among donors and aid agencies sitting on funding is critical to avoid
spending too much money in some sectors/geographic areas and spending too little in others.

* Haiti humanitarian aid 52 percent short of $1.4 bin goal

* Time and money running out for humanitarian effort - UN

By Michelle Nichols

UNITED NATIONS, March 29 (Reuters) - As donors are being asked to dig deep for Haiti's reconstruction,
they also need to address the country's immediate humanitarian need as hurricane season looms and quake
survivors face increasing violence, U.N. officials said on Monday.

While a U.N. summit in New York on Wednesday will aim to raise an initial $3.8 billion for the impoverished
Caribbean nation's recovery, an appeal by the world body for $1.4 billion in humanitarian aid is 52 percent short
of its goal.

The initial appeal by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs for $575 million was met
within a month, but when the call for funding was later more than doubled, the donations slowed to a trickle.

"Perhaps the extension of the flash appeal has got a little bit crowded by the fact that this conference -- with a
big ask for recovery -- is coming, so maybe donors have held back a little," said U.N. Development Program
chief Helen Clark.

"Obviously this medium/long term reconstruction recovery is incredibly important but ... if we don't get the
humanitarian relief side right as well you don't have the foundation for the successful longer term recovery," she
told a news conference.

Possibly more than 300,000 were killed when a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince
on Jan. 12 in what some experts are calling the deadliest natural disaster of modern times. Haiti's economy and
infrastructure were decimated and more than 1 million survivors left homeless.

"We should not think that the humanitarian crisis is over. The rain and the hurricane season will start soon," said
Edmond Mulct, acting head of the U.N. mission in Haiti.

"This may cause hundreds of thousands of Haitians who now live in tents -- some made of sticks and cardboard
-- to once again lose everything," he said. "Lives are at stake; we need to urgently build more durable shelter."

He also said protection of the vulnerable, particularly the women and children in camps, needed to be
strengthened. "But time and money is running out," Mulet said.

Violence is also increasing, he said, with the National Hospital, morgue and aid group Doctors Without Borders
reporting an increase in gunshot wounds. Mulct said there had also been a rise in sexual violence.

Mulct gained notoriety for wielding an iron fist during a previous stint as head of the U.N. mission when he led
mostly Brazilian "blue helmet" troops in a successful crackdown on Haiti's heavily armed gangs.

"Now they are outside on the streets so now we have to start all over again from zero," he said of the thousands
of gang members who escaped from jail after the earthquake.
