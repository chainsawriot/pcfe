Clinton Seeks to Revamp Diplomacy, Development
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

Filed at 11:26 a.m. EST

WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday will unveil plans to restore civilian diplomacy and

development to its former role as the leading edge of American foreign policy.


Clinton is scheduled to present the results of a wide-ranging review of the operations of the State Department and U.S. Agency for
International Development, conducted with the aim of better responding to global threats and emergencies. The proposed changes will
"give our military the partner it needs and deserves," according to an advance copy of the document obtained by The Associated Press.


The plan calls for hiring 5,500 new personnel, creating new positions and the consolidating others under a revamped and streamlined
leadership structure.


The plan also outlines a strategy to reduce the government's reliance on private contractors, which has rapidly expanded over the past
decade, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan.


"We will work to break down walls between agencies," Clinton wrote in an introduction. "We will eliminate overlap, set priorities, and
fund only the work that supports those priorities. We will empower our people to make decisions and hold them accountable for the
results."


No price tag is associated with the changes, which are being presented as a new Congress prepares to be seated next month. Many
Republicans, who are now the majority in the House, have called for deep spending cuts in the State Department and foreign operations
budgets. Moreover, one of Clinton's most powerful allies in efforts to boost civilian operations — Defense Secretary Robert Gates —
plans to leave his post sometime in the coming year.


In her introduction, Clinton said the goal is to ensure that the taxpayer dollar is spent wisely. "It's an important exercise even in the best
economic times. In tough times, it's critical," she wrote.

The plan would set up bureaus for international energy affairs and crisis and conflict operations at State, as well as offices for policy
planning and science and technology at USAID. It would also add a special State Department cyber security coordinator and expand the
department's counterterrorism office.


More broadly, the review calls for giving greater authority to ambassadors and other senior diplomats abroad, making them the top
managers for implementing policy across all U.S. government agencies that have offices in their respective embassies or consulates.


"It sounds basic, but it's the kind of change that will help us tap the full potential of our civilian power," Clinton wrote.


The proposals grow out of the findings of a Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review that Clinton ordered when she became
secretary of state, and reflects the Obama administration's "smart power" approach to foreign policy stressing civilian over military
operations.


The review is dedicated to the late Richard Holbrooke, the veteran diplomat who died Monday.


"He represented the best of our nation's civilian power," it says. "He understood that we cannot project our leadership unless we also
promote our values."


The plan proposes expanding the existing undersecretary of state for democracy and global affairs position to include civilian security
and human rights. The new crisis and conflict operations bureau would report to this official and coordinate civilian responses to
humanitarian emergencies with USAID.


At USAID, the proposal calls for tripling the hiring of midlevel workers from 30 to 95 per year to reduce reliance on outside contractors.
This aims to reverse the 38 percent decline in the agency's work force between 1990 and 2007.
