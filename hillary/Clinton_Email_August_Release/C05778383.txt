Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke passed away this evening, surrounded by his wife, Kati, his sons David and
Anthony, his step-children Elizabeth and Chris Jennings, his daughter-in-law Sarah, and the rest of their
family.

Secretary Clinton released the following statement on his passing:


                                  STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON

                                         Passing of Richard Holbrooke

Tonight America has lost one of its fiercest champions and most dedicated public servants. Richard Holbrooke
served the country he loved for nearly half a century, representing the United States in far-flung war-zones and
high-level peace talks, always with distinctive brilliance and unmatched determination. He was one of a kind --
a true statesman -- and that makes his passing all the more painful.

From his early days in Vietnam to his historic role bringing peace to the Balkans to his last mission in
Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard helped shape our history, manage our perilous present, and secure our future.
He was the consummate diplomat, able to stare down dictators and stand up for America's interests and values
even under the most difficult circumstances. He served at every level of the Foreign Service and beyond,
helping mentor generations of talented officers and future ambassadors. Few people have ever left a larger mark
on the State Department or our country. From Southeast Asia to post-Cold War Europe and around the globe,
people have a better chance of a peaceful future because of Richard's lifetime of service.

I had the privilege to know Richard for many years and to call him a friend, colleague and confidante. As
Secretary of State, I have counted on his advice and relied on his leadership. This is a sad day for me, for the
State Department and for the United States of America.

True to form, Richard was a fighter to the end. His doctors marveled at his strength and his willpower, but to his
friends, that was just Richard being Richard. I am grateful for the tireless efforts of all the medical staff, and to
everyone who sat by his side or wished him well in these final days.

Tonight my thoughts and prayers are with Richard's beloved wife Kati, his sons David and Anthony, his step-
children Elizabeth and Chris Jennings, his daughter-in-law Sarah, and all of his countless friends and
colleagues.
