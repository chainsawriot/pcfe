Subject: (Reuters) Iraqi panel invalidates votes for 52 candidates

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - An Iraqi review panel invalidated the votes of 52 candidates of the March election, officials said,
possibly wiping out the slim lead of a Sunni-backed alliance. It was not immediately clear how many of the candidates
barred for alleged ties to Saddam Hussein's banned Baath party had won seats in the March 7 ballot. If the result
changed, the decision could spark anger among Sunnis just as the sectarian violence unleashed after the 2003 U.S.-led
invasion recedes. The panel's ruling was confirmed by Ali al-Lami, a senior member of a commission that sought to bar
candidates with Baath party links, Tariq Harp, a lawyer for Prime Minister Nuni al-Maliki's State of Law coalition, and
Mustafa al-Hiti, a senior member of the winning lraqiya alliance that was heavily backed by Sunnis.
