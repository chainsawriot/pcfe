Per the subject we discussed, we have a diplomatic, "psychological" issue, not a legal issue. Our friend has to be given a
way out. We should recognize his concerns and frame it in terms of a misunderstanding with no malevolent intent and
that we will make sure there is no recurrence. Our person won't be able to do anything anyway. If he has to leave so be
it.
