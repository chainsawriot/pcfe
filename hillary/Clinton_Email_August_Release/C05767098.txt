Cheryl -- I note that lots of offices write up weekly reports, which we don't do. But given that a lot of the people in S/P do a
lot of great work that S may not know about, I had this memo written up (and believe it or not boiled down many times).
We'll send it up the line, but if u wd send it to her before Monday she can skim it quickly and feel good about all the things
she has made happen. AM
