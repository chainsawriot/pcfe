Subject: (Reuters) Saudi king seeks Syrian help to ease Lebanon tensions

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi ruler King Abdullah meets Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad on July 29 to try to ease tensions in
Lebanon, capitalizing on an apparent weakening in Iran's position after a round of tough new sanctions. The monarch
will hold talks with Assad in Damascus before heading to Beirut where he will meet his ally Premier Saad al-Hariri,
President Michel Suleiman and pro-Western Lebanese political leaders, Saudi officials said. The monarch hopes to
convince Assad to accompany him to Beirut from Damascus, Lebanese officials say, although Syria has not confirmed
that Assad will oblige.
