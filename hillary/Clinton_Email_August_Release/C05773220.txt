This is unbelievable. Or maybe totally so given the forces at work.

oY> By John Tomasic <http://coloradoindepencient.com/authorhohntomasich 1/22/10 3:58 PM Blogging on the
Citizens United Supreme Court ruling is more of what we love about the web. It's the kind of typical collective dissection
we have now come to expect but that never really existed before: serious, speculative; arcane, funny, brilliant, baked,
etc. The Sunlight Foundation blogging <http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/01/22/wait-can-foreign-companies-
now-spend-on-us-political-elections/> is predictably good. Paul Blumenthal dips into the multinational dimension of the
new "corporation as full citizen-person" framework, drawing on blogging going on at Newsweek
<http://biog.newsweek.com/blogs/thegaggle/archive/2010/01/22/should-foreign-corporations-spend-money-on-u-s-
political-candidates.aspx> and the Center for Public Integrity <http://www.publicintegrity.org/articles/entry/1913/> .
"Looks like [the Court] might support allowing foreign companies to spend freely in elections in the United States. I
guess this would be the corporate globalization of the U.S. electoral system." So you gotta ask yourself: Who does Hugo
Chavez want for President?
 Blumenthal excerpting the Center for Public Integrity:



        <http://coloradoindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Picture-142.png>
        The Center for Public Integrity looks at this closer and shows what kind of foreign influence we are looking at:

              One prominent examples is CITGO Petroleum Company — once the American-born Cities Services
Company, but purchased in 1990 by the Venezuelan government-owned Petroieos de Venezuela S.A. The Citizens

United ruling could conceivably allowVenezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who has sharply criticized both of the past
two U.S. presidents, to spend government funds to defeat an American political candidate, just by having CITGO buy TV
ads bashing his target.
                 And it's not just Chavez. The Saudi government owns Houston's Saudi Refining Company and half of
Motive Enterprises. Lenovo, which bought IBM's PC assets in 2004, is partially owned by the Chinese government's
Chinese Academy of Sciences. And Singapore's APL Limited operates several U.S. port operations. A weakening of the
limit on corporate giving could mean China, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and any other country that owns companies that
operate in the U.S. could also have significant sway in American electioneering.

        I really can't see Americans being too happy about this.

Dahlia Lithwick reported for Slate <http://www.slate.com/id/2242208/> from the Supreme Court as the opinions were
being read. She offered this aside:

        While Stevens is reading the portion of his concurrence about the "cautious view of corporate power" held by
the framers, I see Justice Thomas chuckle softly.

Was it a disdainful chuckle at the impotence of his colleague? Was it merely a chuckle of disagreement, of good-natured
exasperation? Was it a chuckle at an anachronistic vision of the framers set beside today's modern corporate silicon and
steel behemoths? I doubt he was thinking about Hugo Chavez.
