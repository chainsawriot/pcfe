According to the Reid staff, they will tentatively start the Treaty on Wednesday and stay on it through COB Thursday.
Then File cloture on the CR. It takes consent to stay on START while we wait for the CR cloture petition to ripen, which
would be Saturday w/o consent. So at least two days on the Treaty, at a minimum, and possibly more. But, the good
news, is that it appears that we are starting the Treaty, and will go back to it after the FY11 funding issues are resolved.


                                                                 We will re-double our efforts to support the SRAP team
and do whatever you need in the coming days on
Af/Pak and beyond.
