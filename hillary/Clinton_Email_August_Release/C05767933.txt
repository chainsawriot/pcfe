Subject: BREAKING NEWS -- NYU GRAD STUDENTS FOUND. SAFE, WELL, IN DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, AND ON THEIR
WAY HOME

Cheryl,
I am once again in your debt. Thank you for all the quick and sustained attention you and the State Department gave
this matter.

I owe you.

At least one good ending...

Here's what I am distributing to news organizations:



STATEMENT FROM NYU SPOKESMAN JOHN BECKMAN

"NYU is very pleased to report that we have been in touch with one of the two missing graduate students who were in Haiti. They
are together and safe and well in the Dominican Republic en route back home to the US. Details of their experience are still
emerging, but our understanding is that they were flown out of the airport near Port-au-Prince by the Coast Guard, whose men and
women we thank for their courage and perseverance.

"The University is very grateful for all the assistance we received from the State Department and other government agencies and
elected officials.

"We're overjoyed to know they are coming home, safe and sound. This is a very happy ending to this story."

 I wasn't going to bother you; little surprise that, nonetheless, this matter made its way to you...

 Just so you know, Walter and I are old friends; he's married to a really close friend of mine from high
 school,             I think the world of them both.

ISOS thinks they can get them out, but we have no communication with the two of them, so no way to
arrange a rendezvous. They're history PhD students; they were supposed to be conducting research in
the Haitian National Archives. Their accommodations are not entirely clear — they were either at a
home in Carrefour district that belonged to the family of the young woman, or they may have been
staying in one of the two hotels recommended to them by other grad students who had studied there:
the Plaza, or the Oloffson.


We'd be grateful for anything the Dept can do. I know what a mess it is down there, and I know there
are a zillion tasks to accomplish. I also know this must be very hard on the State Dept personnel who
are posted there; my thoughts are with them.

Thanks, C. Just knowing you know about it is a relief to me

Yours,
jb

 Could you please contact John Beckman                                at New York University with any
 information you might have on the two AmCits below?

 Thank you for any help you can provide. Regards. Walter.

 Subject: Walter -- I could really use your help

 Walter I could really use your help.

 There are two NYU PhD history students —                 and I           I (both US citizens) — in Port-au-
 Prince or possibly the nearby area of Carrefour. Neither the University nor their families have had any
 contact with them with the earthquake.

 We are having trouble getting in touch with anyone at the State Dept who might be assembling a list of
 those who have contacted the embassy. Are you able to help at all? Their passport numbers are:




 We are very worried, as are their families, of course. If there is anything that can be done to try to track
 them down — or if we can even know they have made contact with US authorities — we would be very
 grateful.

 I know this must be a difficult time for the men and women of the foreign service in the US Embassy in
 Port-au-Prince. Please know that the thoughts of the NYU community are with them in this difficult
 time.

 Thanks for anything you can do, Walter

 John Beckman
