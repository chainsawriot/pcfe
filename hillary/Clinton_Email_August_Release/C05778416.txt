Subject: Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD) published its statement                           1.4(D)

Dear all,

The Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD - directorate under the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign
Affairs) just published a new statement:

            Report on Norwegian assistance to Grameen Bank
            Norad submitted its report today on Norwegian support to
            Grameen Bank in Bangladesh in the 1980s and 1990s.

            Minister of the Environment and International Development Erik
            Solheim requested Norad to prepare the report after the Norwegian
            television series "Brennpunkt" raised the question of where the
            Norwegian aid money had gone.

            Norad's report shows that Grameen Bank transferred a total of NOK
            608.5 million to its sister company Grameen Kalyan in 1996.
            Norway's share of this amount is estimated to be approximately
            NOK 170 million. The Norwegian Embassy in Dhaka reacted
            immediately when it discovered the transfer in 1997. In the
            embassy's view, the transfer was not in accordance with the

      UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05778416 Date: 08/31/2015

            agreement. The matter was raised with Grameen Bank. Following
            negotiations, it was agreed in May 1998 that NOK 170 million was
            to be transferred back from Grameen Kalyan to Grameen Bank.

            "According to the report, there is no indication that Norwegian
            funds have been used for unintended purposes, or that Grameen
            Bank has engaged in corrupt practices or embezzled funds. The
            matter was concluded when the agreement concerning
            reimbursement of the funds was entered into in May 1998 under
            the government in office at the time," said Mr Solheim.

            The report will be made available in English at mfa.no as soon as
            possible.
