That's very nice but you should get it! But, of course, I would accept on behalf of all of us.

Subject: Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative - Award to Secretary Clinton
Importance: High




Hello and Happy New Year Jim,




Friends of WFP has decided to provide its annual "Leadership in the Fight Against Hunger" Award to Secretary Clinton
this year. The award is presented at a ceremony on Capitol Hill (within one of the House/Senate caucus rooms).
Approximately 200 people attend the event including Members of Congress, NGO representatives, business leaders,
administration officials and other leaders in the fight against hunger.




As you know, Friends of WFP is a non-profit organization dedicated to addressing global hunger. Its board members
include former agriculture secretary Dan Glickman, former Senators George McGovern and Bob Dole, YUM Brands CEO
David Novak, former NSC Advisor Sandy Berger and others. I established the organization in 1997.




Before officially announcing Secretary Clinton as this year's award recipient, we hoped to confirm that Secretary Clinton
will be available to personally accept the award. We plan to schedule the award ceremony in September on either a
Tuesday or Wednesday evening (at approximately 6:30/7pm). We would select the specific date based on Secretary
Clinton's schedule.

I think the ceremony would provide another good opportunity to shine a spotlight on the unprecedented commitment
of Secretary Clinton and President Obama to addressing global hunger. Thank you for your help in engaging the
appropriate officials in the State Department.




All the Best,

Rick Leach

Subject: Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative Update

Friends,

As 2009 comes to a close, we wanted to provide you with an update on the U.S. Global Hunger and Food Security
Initiative and share with you what is to come in the new year.

First, a word of thanks for the input that many of you provided on our Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative
consultation document. We received a large amount of interest and excellent suggestions on the document, and we will
soon release a new version that reflects this input.

We are also drafting an implementation plan that will describe in greater detail how we intend to implement the
initiative. We look forward to sharing both documents with you.

In recent months, we have continued to garner international support for the five core principles for global food security
that form the basis of our strategy. In November, all UN member states endorsed these principles at the World Summit
on Food Security in Rome.

1) Invest in country-owned plans

2) Foster strategic coordination

3) Strive for a comprehensive approach to food security

4) Ensure a strong role for the multilateral system

5) Ensure sustained and substantial commitment by all partners to investment in agriculture and food security and
nutrition

In establishing the Rome Principles, the international community declared a new business model for coordinated action
to increase global food security.

Translating these principles into action, on December 6-8, the Government of Rwanda, together with the
Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program, hosted a technical review of its Agriculture Sector Investment
Plan and convened a high-level stakeholders meeting. At the meeting, development partners and the African
Union/NEPAD endorsed Rwanda's plan and agreed to mobilize support for scaled-up financing. The African
Union/NEPAD and representatives from the World Bank, UN, donor countries, the private sector, civil society
organizations, and NGOs attended the meeting.

The United States was represented by a whole-of-government team led by Special Assistant to the President Gayle
Smith that included representatives from the Departments of State, Treasury, and Agriculture, USAID, and MCC. Our
team committed to improve the quality of our aid; to provide robust financial commitments and technical support; and
to work to mobilize additional financing of the Investment Plan.

In the new year, we will continue to engage all stakeholders, work with the international community, and build on our
experience in Rwanda as we move forward with plans to implement our initiative.

Please continue to visit our website: www.state.gov/s/globalfoodsecurity to stay informed of planning for the initiative
and to provide input.

We wish you a happy new year and look forward to continuing to work closely with you.

The Global Hunger and Food Security Team
