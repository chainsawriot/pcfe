First — welcome back! I hope you had a good break. (if anyone deserves a break you certainly do)

 Please convey my thanks to the Secretary for doing the speech . She was fantastic — delivering our message eloquently
and effectively. I have gotten very positive feed-back from people in our community. This gives us an excellent platform
for the future.

And thank you for being so supportive of this effort all along the way.

Best

Mike
