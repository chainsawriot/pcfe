Kerry: "No plans" to go to Iran
Yesterday, Iranian media reported comments from the Iranian foreign ministry spokesman that the Iranian
parliament was considering an alleged request filed by Sen. John Kerry (D-MA) to travel to Iran.

Today, Fred Jones, spokesman for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told POLITICO that "John Kerry
has no plans to visit Iran."

Jones added that "We never discuss the Senator's private or diplomatic conversations."

Asked if that implied that Kerry was exploring the possibility of meeting Iranian officials elsewhere in a third
country, Jones said. no. "There are no plans to meet with any Iranian officials abroad."

Interestingly, for the past week, Kerry's office has used variations of "unaware of plans" or "no plans" to discuss
these Iran meetings rumors -- rather than "no."

And at face value, Jones' statement today does not seem to be the kind of flat denial that Kerry had filed such a
request, but doesn't seem to indicate such a meeting is imminent. It also does not seem to close the door that
such plans have been or are being or will be explored.

Has occurred to me that having a non administration lawmaker showing willingness to keep a channel open
with Tehran could serve several purposes, in that it's not the administration offering to send an envoy. It could
also distract a lot of attention away as a kind of decoy from other conversations that might or might not be
going on.
