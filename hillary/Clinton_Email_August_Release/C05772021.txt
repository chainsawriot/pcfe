       Subject:

           Ambassador Kim — Governor Richardson wanted me to send you the following e-mail. My direct line
           is             if you need to contact me or the Governor. Thanks — Janis

           Dear Ambassador Kim,

           Since I haven't heard from you I assume my trip to North Korea is okay with you guys. My plan is to
           leave Monday, December 13th, stay for 2 days and return to the United States on the weekend.

           The North Koreans have assured me that they will not exploit my visit and that they have some positive
           messages to convey. They know that I am not an envoy of the administration and that is fine with them.

           My sense is that they will with draw the invitation if I postpone once again at your request.

           Needless to say, the Obama administration wishes will be an important factor to me as I pursue this trip.

           All the best — Bill Richardson
