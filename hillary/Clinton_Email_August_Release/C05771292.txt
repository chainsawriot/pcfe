Apparently Secretary Clinton got Mubarak's agreement to release the boys. The father is
headed to Cairo on Monday to pick them up at the embassy. Staff at the embassy and at the
State Dept is now saying that this is only a visitation. As you can imagine the family is
really upset and the supporters are livid. They are expecting that Colin will be headed back
to the states with the boys Tuesday. The press wants to know what is going on. Any advice
here, because I have no idea what is going on? Many thanks to you and esp to Hillary for
getting us this far. Howard
