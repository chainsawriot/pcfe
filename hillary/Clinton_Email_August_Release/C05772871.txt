Cheryl,

As you know, we are working with Melanne on the upcoming Commission on the Status of Women/February 2011. The
US has been asked to nominate experts to participate in interactive panels during the meeting. Specifically, experts
should focus on the link between women's education and employment, women's participation in science and
technology education and employment, women's access to and use of technology, or gender biases in scientific
knowledge production and product design. We understand that US nominees are often not selected for these panels
given needs to balance regional representations. Still, we should submit one or two names for consideration. Our
suggested nominations would be                                who could speak to any of the topical areas listed; Dr.
                                                              another possibility is                    who just left
DOE. Just wondering if S would have anyone else in particular she would like to put forward.

Thanks.
Kern-Ann
