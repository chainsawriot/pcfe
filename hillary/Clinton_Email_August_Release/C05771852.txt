Subject: (AP) Senator: Arms treaty less urgent than other issues

WASHINGTON (AP) - A leading Republican lawmaker is rejecting the Obama administration's assertion that ratification
of a new arms control treaty with Russia is so pressing that it must be dealt with by the lame-duck Senate. Senator Jon
Kyl of Arizona said Sunday that the Senate has much more urgent business to attend to in the weeks before it breaks for
Christmas. He said the treaty, known as New START, is extremely complex and can wait until the Senate reconvenes
with newly elected members in January. The Obama administration has said ratification is an urgent national security
priority. Kyl said on NBC's "Meet the Press" that delaying a vote would reflect the reality of considering a major treaty in
three weeks amid important domestic issues.
