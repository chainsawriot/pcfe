In the cover news briefing for the clips today, there is a reference to Prince Turki blasting me over the WMD free Middle
East proposal, saying we have a double standard re Iran and Israel. It's an AFP story but it is not printed in the clips. Can
you pls track down, send to me and ask NEA for analysis? Thx.
