JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Talks to avert a public sector strike next week which could cripple Israel's ports and airports have
been suspended and will resume after the weekend, Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz said on October 29. The Histadrut
labor union wants a 10.5 percent pay rise over three years for the 700,000 public sector workers it represents, but the
Finance Ministry has offered 1.5 percent. Talks will resume on October 31, the first day of the Israeli working
week. "The gaps are still large but at least we have been able to outline (our differences). I think there is no cause for a
strike, it will harm everybody -- citizens, the economy and the workers themselves," Steinitz told reporters. Unions have
indicated they may call a strike as early as November 2, which could shut down public transport, government offices and
some government-owned companies. Health services and utilities would function at reduced capacity. An official with
Histadrut, which represents public sector staff, said the pay rise sought by union leaders was justified. "We are looking
to reach a decision and gain a realistic wage rise for the workers. This is the heart of the negotiations," Avi Nisan-Koren
told reporters.
