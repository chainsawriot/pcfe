Subject: (AP) Israeli leaders condemn Clinton immigrant comments

JERUSALEM (AP) - Israeli leaders are criticizing former President Clinton's comment that Russian immigrants in Israel an
obstacle to peace. Clinton noted the most recent arrivals in Israel have the hardest time agreeing to share the land with
the Palestinians. He also said residents who have been in Israel the longest and have more of a historical perspective and
are most supportive of peace in Israel. Among the Israel leaders criticizing Clinton's comments is Foreign Minister
Lieberman, whose political party relies heavily on immigrant support. He called the remarks "crude generalizations" and
interference in Israel's internal affairs.
