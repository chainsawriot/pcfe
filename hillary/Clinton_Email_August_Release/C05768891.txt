Subject                            FW: Updated Pakistan Plan
Attachments:                       Pak PD Plan Update for US McHale - 12MAR10.pptx



I have attached a copy of the status report for the Pakistan Communications Plan which was approved last September.
You will note that we have made progress on many fronts. The Post has significantly increased its engagement with the
media and responds immediately to rumors and inaccurate stories. There has also been a significant increase in the
number of exchange participants. We are continuing to experience difficulty in filling critical positions and I am working
with Nancy Powell to address this issue.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

JM
