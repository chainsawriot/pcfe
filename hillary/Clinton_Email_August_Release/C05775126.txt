WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States continues to press for Israeli-Palestinian direct peace talks to advance
despite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to allow a temporary freeze on settlement construction to
expire, the U.S. State Department said September 26.

  "We keep pushing for the talks to continue," said State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley in a brief statement,
adding that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had spoken to Netanyahu twice on September 26.
