Subject:                            Embracing the PPD



In your book tonight, as Tab 4 of the materials for the USGLC event, is a list I put together of all the key things you said in
your CGD speech and the parallel language in the PPD. It is really worth skimming; it shows at a glance how you set the
agenda and won the day. As the Secretary who came in determined to elevate development, you have a great deal to
take credit for in launching the first national development policy. And as my PPD staff briefings with Gayle on the Hill
today demonstrated, the PPD sets the table beautifully for the QDDR.
