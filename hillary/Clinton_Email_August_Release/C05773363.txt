First of all, heads up on Menendez tomorrow. We could punt today and simply say we look forward to receiving the
committee's recommendations without commenting further. Regarding the Brits, all we need to say is that the British
government, like the U.S. government, believe that the release was a mistake. I do not see a need to feed this, but we
will be asked about it tomorrow.

Subject: Lockerbie report tomorrow

PJ-- Senator Menendez and company are released their report on Lockerbie/Megrahi release timed for tomorrow, the
22nd anniversary of the bombing. One of their recommendations that is that the State Department "launch its own inquiry
into al-Megrahi's release" to "exhaustively identify and interview sources" to determine how and why Megrahi was
released.
Looking for comment...
Im also led to believe that the British govt. inquiry promised by Cameron has in fact uncovered additional documents
showing there may have additional communcations by the Brits to the Scots about the importance of releasing
Megrahi. Im assuming that State Department has been informed about some of this and you might be able to shed some
light...
