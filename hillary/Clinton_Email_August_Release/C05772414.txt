Subject:                       Your speech on the Mideast



Madame Secretary,
On Wednesday, you're scheduled to give a 15-minute talk at a gala hosted by the American Task Force on
Palestine, a moderate, pro-peace Palestinian-American organization. Here's a quick overview of our plans for
the speech, which we developed with NEA. Please let us know if you have any reactions.

The audience in the room will include Palestinian-Americans who are influential in their communities: lawyers,
doctors, business leaders, etc. Of course, a much larger audience beyond the room will read this speech as
well. This is your first opportunity to address this issue in a serious way since the end of the moratorium.




Key points:
