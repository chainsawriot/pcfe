Cheryl,
You should know that Katie Dowd is working around the clock on Internet Freedom and doing a spectacular job.

In addition, this Haiti texting program (on which my role was little to nothing) was Katie Dowd + Stanton, Caitlin + James
Eberhard (who was at dinner last week and who was woken up in Pakistan) with Katie Dowd playing the key leadership
role. $200K raised so far.
