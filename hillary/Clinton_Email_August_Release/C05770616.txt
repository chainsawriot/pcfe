Another example of "you should take the log from your own eye before criticizing the speck in your neighbor's."

FYI, from WHA:




Mexican law enforcement officials cannot stop individuals and require proof of migratory status. However, like 5131070,
officials in the course of official "contact" (i.e. Traffic stops, investigations, hot pursuit) are authorized to request proof
of migratory status. They do this in practice routinely. Frequently, individuals who cannot prove legal status are referred
to INM (federal CBP-equivalent). In practice, GoM authorities at all levels engage in exploitative treatment of migrants,
primarily Central Americans heading to the US. These abuses have been well documented by international human rights
groups, as well as by multiple documentary and news media reports.
