Subject: (AP) Haiti PM: U.S. Baptists knew removing kids was wrong

PORT-AU-PRINCE (AP) - Haiti's prime minister says it's clear to him that the 10 U.S. Baptists who tried to take 33 Haitian
children out of the quake-ravaged country "knew what they were doing was wrong." Prime Minister Max Bellerive also
tells The Associated Press his country is open to having the Americans tried in the United States. Bellerive says some of
the children have parents who are alive. The government is attempting to locate them. He says a judicial system needs
to determine whether the Americans were acting in good faith, as they claim, or are child traffickers. The Americans are
mostly from Idaho. They have been held since being arrested January 29 trying to enter the Dominican Republic with the
children.
