Subject: Urgent -- Rep. Loretta Sanchez Re Vietnam HR

In case Rep. Loretta Sanchez engages the Secretary on the margins of her internet freedom speech, here is some quick
background and a few suggested points we didn't have time to clear it with anyone, but I thought better something
than nothing. Scot



Background:


Representative Loretta Sanchez asked yesterday to speak with you regarding her concerns that the Administration is
moving too fast in the direction of providing economic benefits to Vietnam -- for example, granting access to the
General System of Preferences (GSP), permitting participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) as an associate
member -- even as the human rights situation deteriorates. Sanchez may try to button-hole you at your Internet speech
today.
