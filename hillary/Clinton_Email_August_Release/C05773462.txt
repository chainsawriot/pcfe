General and specific concerns: Specifically heard from Haiti is that Preval has acceded too much authority to the Vorbe
family.

Second, more general, is that the BAMBAM families (the term, I understand, created from the initials of the 6 leading
elite families) are gearing up to inflate costs of doing things and to try to monopolize to the extent they can. Will
forward in a separate email one or two articles I've seen on this.

I'm off to Trinity to prepare my classes for this week. (A reality of my full-time teaching load). While check email later.
Thanks for this opportunity to share thoughts. Am very anxious to do this.

Can't miss the NFC game, even though the Eagles (I'm from Philly) already collapsed. I also lived in S.W. Louisiana during
the N.O. "Aints" years.

Best - Bob

          You and our secretary share similar concerns about making sure Haiti's future is decided by Haiti.




        When we met with PM and P, they both indicated they wanted US to play a large coordination role on their
behalf to ensure their voice, plans and goals were accomplished. We are committed to doing that as they requested.

       I do think fast will mean some will make money they shouldn't — but goal is to have balance so we move with
enough alacrity to build confidence that things are getting done.




        Who are the Haiti "operator" types of which this concern is being spoken?

         I hope the GOH has back-up to hold firm to its positions. Some will want to push it around. Also, while urgent
need for tent cities clear PAP is clear, definitely not part of solution. Fearful of potential permanance of them unless
alternates for rural resettlement along lines of talking points exist.

        Am hearing that lots of concern that Haiti's "operators" are licking their chops to make lots of money off this.
Fact of life or need to expand circle of actors?

        Hang in there. - Bob

                 Cheryl - See below the response of Leslie Voltaire and PM Jean Max Bellerive to talking points for
tomorrow's Montreal meeting I proposed yesterday. Talking points at the end. Response positive. I have also shared
these with Paul Farmer. Same response. Sources at the UN fear, however, that the donors will focus on PAP and miss
this historic opportunity. - Bob

                 Leslie - First, thank god you were in NYC on Jan 12th. I hope your personal losses were minimal.
Surely, Haiti has lost much. We all have...

                Thoughts for Montreal:

                 1. This offers an opportunity to 'rebalance' Haiti.
                 2. Pay attention to the exodus from PAP and catch up with it. (The migration to PAP over the past 30
years was an unnatural development, spurred by rural neglect and urban concentration.)
                 3. A decentralized system of 'welcome centers' in town and villages can assist returnees re-integrate.
Medical and continuing education services should be a part of them. NEED TO ACT NOW.
                 4. More important, the centers must be equipped to provide work - make them the basis for organizing
the civic service corps. Higly decentralized: work for cash; public works/environmental restoration/food production;
restoration of human dignity; rural-urban partnerships through work;e in Haiti's real future. Also a chance to begin
repairing the social fabric. Will need a 'tough love' approach; disciplined management. Not the work for NGOs.
                 5. No investment in rural areas and no response to this opportunity will = back to the future re. crowded
PAP. People will trickle back to the city to replicate past problems.
                 6. The damage was done before the earthquake by development/investment policies that ignored the
rural areas; saw Haitians simply as sources of cheap labor; denigrated human dignity; failed to strengthen local
institutions.
                 7. This must stop; can't happen again.
                 8. This is the time to move forward with the Civic Service Corps - quickly.

                kenbe. Pa lage. - Bob
