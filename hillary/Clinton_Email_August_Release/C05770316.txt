You were right about Vitamin A, no surprise (although a bit surprising that none of the experts noticed it). I've changed
it to oral rehydration therapy. I've also added ORT to the Jim Grant story.

Huma has a copy of the MDGs for you.

I hope it's a lovely event! They are VERY excited to have you there.

Thx for the changes you made. A few questions:

 Is the Vitamin A research on p. 8 accurate given recent research that raised doubts about it efficacy?

 Will you print out a copy of the MDGs for me to have for speech?

 Is there a teleprompter?

 Didn't Jim Grant also pioneer the widespread use of oral rehydration therapy? If so, we should include too.

 It is so much better—thank you.

To more fully answer your question, the CARE speech is important because it focuses on a chronically overlooked issue
(nutrition) that sits at the intersection of two of your signature issues. It gives us an opportunity to sharpen our
development message. It also tees up the health care speech you might give before UNGA. This is a speech that only
you could give and a number of constituencies will be delighted by it.




Hope this helps. I'm going through it now to make sure it more clearly answers your question.




Thank you!
