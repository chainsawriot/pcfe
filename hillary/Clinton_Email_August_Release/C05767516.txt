Re: New developments on NI

Shaun regrets he cannot come here tomorrow. Here's the problem and the plan: Cameron is still quietly giving
encouragement to the Ulster Unionists, which, led by Reg Empey, are trying to scuttle the agreement somehow.
So the plan is for Shaunn to announce he will deliver a speech on Monday in the House of Commons presenting
the agreement—except that at the last second Gordon will step in on the floor for Shaun, requiring Cameron to
respond, theoretically forcing him to support the agreement. In his speech, Gordon will explicitly cite your role
and support of the US—among other things further cornering Cameron (and Empey). Shaun would like to speak
with you soon depending on how things are working out there, perhaps tomorrow (Sunday) or perhaps Monday
(perhaps after Commons). Dinner will be on a rain-check.
