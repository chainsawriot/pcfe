Pat as of 8/23 for the Pakistan Flood Relief:

     1.    Have received $21, 170 in pledge funds from texting all at $10 each so 2,117 pledges
     2.    Have received $73,358 in credit card donations from 608 donors
     3.    Have received $ 1,725 in ACH donations from 15 donors
     4.    Have received $14,025 in mailed in checks from 92 donors
     5.    Have received $ 3 in cash from one donor

So in total we have received $110,281 in pledges and donations from 2833 donors (assuming all my math is
right)

On average this is about $39 per donation/pledge if you excluded the ten dollar pledges/donations the
average donation was $124 dollars

As we discussed I will provide a more standardized reporting every Tuesday and Thursday - just let me know if
you want anyone else included on the reporting - jim
