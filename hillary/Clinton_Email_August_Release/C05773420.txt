Tomgram: Max Blumenthal, The Great Fear



By Max Blumenthal
Posted on December 19, 2010, Printed on December 20, 2010 http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175334/

Moments of imperial and economic decline -- according to a recent poll, 65% of Americans now believe
<http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38996574/ns/politics/> this country to be "in a state of decline" -- can also be periods
of cultishness, even of madness incarnate. Such a mood now seems to be spreading through the United States. It's not
so surprising, really. Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, fear
<http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175325/tomgram%3A_engelhardt_the_united_states_offear/> has been
injected <http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175206/tomgram:_engelhardt_fear_inc.> into this "homeland" like a
drug and a penumbra <http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/> of official secrecy has settled over
the land in a way that makes the secrecy of the Cold War years (when this country faced a superpower, not a ragtag set
of jihadis, guerrillas, and terrorists) seem like an era of sunshine.
In an atmosphere of swirling fears and hysteria amid declining living conditions, "explanations" that at other times might
have remained confined to tiny crews of conspiracy-mongers can suddenly gain a patina of plausibility and so traction.
No wonder then that, as hard times hit, as the financial system seemed on the verge of collapse, as unemployment
soared and a massive wave of home foreclosures swept into view, increasing numbers of Americans became prey to any
wacky explanation for our troubles, none more so than the idea that Islam was somehow responsible, that mosques and
Islamic centers <http://www.tomdispatch.com/archive/175283/stephan_salisbury_extremism_at_ground_zero> meant
for a sliver of a minority here were capable of imposing anything, no less a way of life on this country, or that Sharia law
(of all things) might somehow worm its way into state legal systems <http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/shariah-law-ban-
oklahoma-renews-debate-draws-legal/story?id=12112985> , or that YouTube was a hotbed of terrorism
<http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageld=239393> worthy of suppression, or... well, you name it.

us deep into one of those crews of conspiracy-mongers who, at another time, just about no one would have paid much
attention to, but in twenty-first-century America have gained a remarkable audience. They are a chilling barometer of

     The Great Islamophobic Crusade
     Inside the Bizarre Cabal of Secretive Donors, Demagogic Bloggers, Pseudo-Scholars, European Neo-Fascists, Violent
Israeli Settlers, and Republican Presidential Hopefuls Behind the Crusade
     By Max Blumenthal <http://www.tomdispatch.com/authors/maxblumenthal>
     Nine years after 9/11, hysteria about Muslims in American life has gripped the country. With it has gone an outburst
<http://www.tomdispatch.com/archive/175283/stephan_salisbury_extremism_at_ground_zero> of arson attacks on
mosques, campaigns to stop their construction, and the branding of the Muslim-American community, overwhelmingly
moderate, as a hotbed of potential terrorist recruits. The frenzy has raged from rural Tennessee to New York City, while
in Oklahoma, voters even overwhelmingly approved <http://thinkprogress.org/2010/11/11/oklahoma-sharia-native-
americans/> a ballot measure banning the implementation of Sharia law in American courts (not that such a prospect
existed). This campaign of Islamophobia wounded President Obama politically, as one out of five Americans have bought
into <http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1701/poll-obama-muslim-christian-church-out-of-politics-political-leaders-religious>
a sustained chorus of false rumors about his secret Muslim faith. And it may have tainted views of Muslims in general;
an August 2010 Pew Research Center poll revealed <http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1706/poll-americans-views-of-
muslims-object-to-new-york-islamic-center-islam-violence> that, among Americans, the favorability rating of Muslims
had dropped by 11 points since 2005.
     Erupting so many years after the September 11th trauma, this spasm of anti-Muslim bigotry might seem oddly
timed and unexpectedly spontaneous. But think again: it's the fruit of an organized, long-term campaign by a tight
confederation of right-wing activists and operatives who first focused on Islamophobia soon after the September 11th
attacks, but only attained critical mass during the Obama era. It was then that embittered conservative forces, voted
out of power in 2008, sought with remarkable success to leverage cultural resentment into political and partisan gain.
     This network is obsessively fixated on the supposed spread of Muslim influence in America. Its apparatus spans
continents, extending from Tea Party activists here to the European far right. It brings together in common cause right-
wing ultra-Zionists, Christian evangelicals, and racist British soccer hooligans. It reflects an aggressively pro-Israel
sensibility, with its key figures venerating the Jewish state as a Middle Eastern Fort Apache on the front lines of the
Global War on Terror and urging the U.S. and various European powers to emulate its heavy-handed methods.

     Little of recent American Islamophobia (with a strong emphasis on the "phobia") is sheer happenstance. Years
before Tea Party shock troops massed for angry protests outside the proposed site of an Islamic community center in
lower Manhattan, representatives of the Israel lobby and the Jewish-American establishment launched a campaign
against pro-Palestinian campus activism that would prove a seedbed for everything to come. That campaign quickly --
and perhaps predictably -- morphed into a series of crusades against mosques and Islamic schools which, in turn,
attracted an assortment of shady but exceptionally energetic militants into the network's ranks.
     Besides providing the initial energy for the Islamophobic crusade, conservative elements from within the pro-Israel
lobby bankrolled the network's apparatus, enabling it to influence the national debate. One philanthropist in particular
has provided the beneficence to propel the campaign ahead. He is a little-known Los Angeles-area software security
entrepreneur named Aubrey Chernick, who operates out of a security consulting firm blandly named the National
Center for Crisis and Continuity Coordination. A former trustee of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, which
has served as a think tank for the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a frontline lobbying group for Israel,
Chernick is said to be worth $750 million.
     Chernick's fortune is puny compared to that of the billionaire Koch Brothers
<http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/30/100830fa_fact_mayer> , extraction industry titans who fund Tea
Party-related groups like Americans for Prosperity, and it is dwarfed by the financial empire of Haim Saban, the Israeli-
American media baron who is one of the largest private donors
<http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/05/10/100510fa_fact_bruck> to the Democratic party and recently
 matched <http://www.jewishjournal.com/hollywoodjew/item/haim_saban_andrea_bocelli_add_up_to_9_million-
 dollar-nightfor_fidf_2010121/> $9 million raised for the Friends of the Israeli Defense Forces in a single night.

However, by injecting his money into a small but influential constellation of groups and individuals with a narrow
agenda, Chernick has had a considerable impact.
      Through the Fairbrook Foundation
<http://www.politico.com/blogs/laurarozen/0910/The_Park51_money_trail.html?showall> , a private entity he and his
wife Joyce control, Chernick has provided funding to groups ranging from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and
CAMERA, a right-wing, pro-Israel, media-watchdog outfit, to violent Israeli settlers living on Palestinian lands and figures
like the pseudo-academic author Robert Spencer, who is largely responsible for popularizing conspiracy theories about
the coming conquest of the West by Muslim fanatics seeking to establish a worldwide caliphate. Together, these groups
spread hysteria about Muslims into Middle American communities where immigrants from the Middle East have
recently settled, and they watched with glee as likely Republican presidential frontrunners from Mike Huckabee to Sarah
Palin promoted <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbUxcgrgUnE&feature=related> their cause and parroted
<http://www.politicsdaily.com/2010/07/18/sarah-palin-to-muslims-reject-ground-zero-mosqueh their tropes. Perhaps
the only thing more surprising than the increasingly widespread appeal of Islamophobia is that, just a few years ago, the
phenomenon was confined to a few college campuses and an inner city neighborhood, and that it seemed like a fleeting
fad that would soon pass from the American political landscape.
      Birth of a Network
      The Islamophobic crusade was launched in earnest at the peak of George W. Bush's prestige when the
neoconservatives and their allies were riding high. In 2003, three years after the collapse of President Bill Clinton's
attempt to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian issue and in the immediate wake of the invasion of Iraq, a network of Jewish
groups, ranging from ADL and the American Jewish Committee to AIPAC, gathered to address what they saw as a sudden
rise in pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses nationwide. That meeting gave birth to the David Project, a campus
advocacy group led by Charles Peters, who had co-founded CAMERA, one of the many outfits bankrolled by Chernick.
With the help of public relations professionals, Peters conceived <http://www.thenation.com/article/mideast-comes-
columbia > a plan to "take back the campus by influencing public opinion through lectures, the Internet, and coalitions,"
as a memo produced at the time by the consulting firm McKinsey and Company stated.
       In 2004, after conferring with Martin Kramer, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, the pro-
Israel think tank where Chernoff had served as a trustee, Peters produced a documentary film that he called Columbia
Unbecoming <http://nymag.com/nymetro/urban/education/features/10868/>. It was filled with claims from Jewish
students at Columbia University claiming they had endured intimidation and insults from Arab professors. The film
portrayed that New York City school's Department of Middle East and Asian Languages and Cultures as a hothouse of
anti-Semitism.
       In their complaints, the students focused on one figure in particular: Joseph Massad
<http://www.columbia.edu/cu/mealac/faculty/massadh , a Palestinian professor of Middle East studies. He was known
for his passionate advocacy of the formation of a binational state between Israel and Palestine, as well as for his strident
 criticism of what he termed "the racist character of Israel." The film identified him as "one of the most dangerous
 intellectuals on campus," while he was featured as a crucial villain in The Professors: The 101 Most Dangerous
 Academics in America, a book by the (Chernick-funded) neoconservative activist David Horowitz. As Massad was
 seeking tenure at the time, he was especially vulnerable to this sort of wholesale assault.
       When the controversy over Massad's views intensified, Congressman Anthony Weiner, a liberal New York Democrat
 who once described himself <http://www.zoa.oresitedocuments/pressrelease_view.asp?pressreleaselD=228 > as a
 representative of "the ZOA [Zionist Organization of America] wing of the Democratic Party," demanded that Columbia
 President Lee Bollinger, a renowned First Amendment scholar, fire the professor. Bollinger responded by issuing
 uncharacteristically defensive statements about the "limited" nature of academic freedom.
        In the end, however, none of the charges stuck. Indeed, the testimonies in the David Project film were eventually
  either discredited or never corroborated. In 2009, Massad earned tenure after winning
 <http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct/jul_aug08/around_the_quads10> Columbia's prestigious Lionel Trilling Award
  for excellence in scholarship.
         <http://www.amazon.com/dp/1568584172/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20> Having demonstrated its ability to
  intimidate faculty members and even powerful university administrators, however, Kramer claimed a moral victory in
  the name of his project, boasting to the press that "this is a turning point." While the David Project subsequently
  fostered chapters on campuses nationwide, its director set out on a different path -- initially, into the streets of Boston
  in 2004 to oppose the construction of the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center.

     For nearly 15 years, the Islamic Society of Boston had sought to build the center in the heart of Roxbury, the city's
largest black neighborhood, to serve its sizable Muslim population. With endorsements from Mayor Thomas Menino
and leading Massachusetts lawmakers, the mosque's construction seemed like a fait accompli -- until, that is, the Rupert
Murdoch-owned Boston Herald and his local Fox News affiliate snapped into action. Boston Globe columnist Jeff Jacoby
also chimed in with a series of reports
<http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2007/01/10/the_boston_mosques_saudi_conne
ction/> claiming the center's plans were evidence of a Saudi Arabian plot to bolster the influence of radical Islam in the
United States, and possibly even to train underground terror cells.
     It was at this point that the David Project entered the fray, convening elements of the local pro-Israel community in
the Boston area to seek strategies to torpedo the project. According to emails
<http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/W00705/S00149.htm> obtained by the Islamic Society's lawyers in a lawsuit against
the David Project, the organizers settled on a campaign of years of nuisance lawsuits, along with accusations that the
center had received foreign funding from "the Wahhabi movement in Saudi Arabia or... the Moslem Brotherhood."
     In response, a grassroots coalition of liberal Jews initiated
<http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2009/07/05/trustworthy_community/> inter-
faith efforts aimed at ending a controversy that had essentially been manufactured out of thin air and was corroding
relations between the Jewish and Muslim communities in the city. Peters would not, however, relent. "We are more
concerned now than we have ever been about a Saudi influence of local mosques," he announced
<http://www.forward.com/articles/11052/> at a suburban Boston synagogue in 2007.
     After paying out millions of dollars in legal bills and enduring countless smears, the Islamic Society of Boston
completed the construction of its community center in 2008. Meanwhile, not surprisingly, nothing came of the David
Project's dark warnings. As Boston-area National Public Radio reporter Philip Martin reflected
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/phillip-martin/the-mosque-next-door-what_b_720914.html> in September 2010,
"The horror stories that preceded [the center's] development seem shrill and histrionic in retrospect."
     The Network Expands
     This second failed campaign was, in the end, more about movement building than success, no less national security.
The local crusade established an effective blueprint for generating hysteria against the establishment of Islamic centers
and mosques across the country, while galvanizing a cast of characters who would form an anti-Muslim network which
 would gain attention and success in the years to come.
     In 2007, these figures coalesced into a proto-movement that launched a new crusade, this time targeting the Khalil
 Gibran International Academy, a secular Arabic-English elementary school in Brooklyn, New York. Calling their ad hoc
 pressure group, Stop the Madrassah <http://stopthemadrassa.wordpress.com/> madrassah being simply the Arab
 word for "school" -- the coalition's activists included an array of previously unknown zealots who made no attempt to
 disguise their extreme views when it came to Islam as a religion, as well as Muslims in America. Their stated goal was to
 challenge the school's establishment on the basis of its violation of the church-state separation in the U.S. Constitution.
 The true aim of the coalition, however, was transparent: to pressure the city's leadership to adopt an antagonistic
 posture towards the local Muslim community.
      The activists zeroed in on the school's principal, Debbie Almontaser, a veteran educator of Yemeni descent, and
 baselessly branded <http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/13/nyregion/13principal.html> her "a jihadist" as well as a 9/11
 denier. They also accused her of -- as Pamela Geller, a far-right blogger just then gaining prominence put it
 <http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/khalil_gibran_international_academy/> , "whitewash[ing] the
 genocide against the Jews." Daniel Pipes, a neoconservative academic previously active in the campaigns against Joseph
 Massad and the Boston Islamic center (and whose pro-Likud think tank, Middle East Forum, has received $150,000 from
 Chernick) claimed <http://www.danielpipes.org/4441/a-madrasa-grows-in-brooklyn> the school should not go ahead
 because "Arabic-language instruction is inevitably laden with Pan-Arabist and Islamist baggage." As the campaign
 reached a fever pitch, Almontaser reported that members of the coalition were actually stalking
 <http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/16/former-arabic-school-principal-faces-defamation-suit/> her wherever
 she went.
      Given what Columbia Journalism School professor and former New York Times reporter Samuel Freedman called
 <http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/29/education/29education.html> "her clear, public record of interfaith activism
 and outreach," including work with the New York Police Department and the Anti-Defamation League after the
 September 11th attacks, the assault on Almontaser seemed little short of bizarre -- until her assailants discovered a
 photograph of a T-shirt produced by AWAAM, a local Arab feminist organization, that read "Intifada NYC." As it turned

      UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773420 Date: 08/31/2015
      UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773420 Date: 08/31/2015



out, AWAAM sometimes shared office space with a Yemeni-American association on which Almontaser served as a
board member. Though the connection seemed like a stretch, it promoted the line of attack the Stop the Madrassah
coalition had been seeking.
     Having found a way to wedge the emotional issue of the Israel-Palestine conflict into a previously New York-
centered campaign, the school's opponents next gained a platform at the Murdoch-owned New York Post, where
reporters Chuck Bennett and Jana Winter claimed
<http://www.nypost.com/p/news/regional/item_UerzwvF7fcSQY8Y0P1In4K> her T-shirt was "apparently a call for a
Gaza-style uprising in the Big Apple." While Almontaser attempted to explain to the Post's reporters that she rejected
terrorism, the Anti-Defamation League chimed in on cue. ADL spokesman Oren Segal told the Post: "The T-shirt is a
reflection of a movement that increasingly lauds violence against Israelis instead of rejecting it. That is disturbing."
     Before any Qassam rockets could be launched from Almontaser's school, her former ally New York Mayor Michael
Bloomberg caved to the growing pressure and threatened to shut down the school, prompting her to resign. A Jewish
principal who spoke no Arabic replaced Almontaser, who later filed a lawsuit against the city for breaching her free
speech rights. In 2010, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ruled
<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/26/nyregion/26principal.html?emc=eta1> that New York's Department of
Education had "succumbed to the very bias that the creation of the school was intended to dispel" by firing Almontaser
and urged it pay her $300,000 in damages. The commission also concluded that the Post had quoted her misleadingly.
     Though it failed to stop the establishment of the Khalil Gibran Academy, the burgeoning anti-Muslim movement
succeeded in forcing city leaders to bend to its will, and having learned just how to do that, then moved on in search of
more high-profile targets. As the New York Times reported
<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/28/nyregion/28school.html> at the time, "The fight against the school... was only
an early skirmish in a broader, national struggle."
      "It's a battle that has really just begun," Pipes told the Times.
      From Scam to Publicity Coup
      Pipes couldn't have been more on the mark. In late 2009, the Islamophobes sprang into action again when the
Cordoba Initiative, a non-profit Muslim group headed by Feisal Abdul Rauf, an exceedingly moderate Sufi Muslim imam
who regularly traveled abroad <http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2010_08/025164.php>
representing the United States at the behest of the State Department, announced that it was going to build a
community center in downtown New York City. With the help of investors, Rauf s Cordoba Initiative purchased space
two blocks from Ground Zero in Manhattan. The space was to contain a prayer area as part of a large community center
that would be open to everyone in the neighborhood.
      None of these facts mattered to Pamela Geller. Thanks to constant prodding at her blog, Atlas Shrugged, Geller
made Cordoba's construction plans a national issue, provoking fervent calls from conservatives to protect the "hallowed
ground" of 9/11 from creeping Sharia. (That the "mosque" would have been out of sight of Ground Zero and that the
neighborhood was, in fact, filled with <http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/08/16/2010-08-
16_a_sea_of filth_near_ground_zer0_mosque_gets_all_the_press_but_porns_around_corne.html> everything from
strip clubs to fast-food joints didn't matter.) Geller's activism against Cordoba House earned the 52-year-old full-time
blogger the attention she apparently craved, including a long profile
<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/nyregion/10geller.html> in the New York Times and frequent cable news spots,
 especially, of course, on Fox News.
      Mainstream reporters tended to focus on Geller's bizarre stunts. She posted a video of herself splashing around
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TG7DTOkU-s> in a string bikini on a Fort Lauderdale beach, for instance, while
 ranting about "left-tards" and "Nazi Hezbollah." Her call <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-
 dyn/content/article/2010/10/17/AR2010101702840.html> for boycotting Campbell's Soup because the company
 offered halal -- approved under Islamic law (as kosher food is under Jewish law) --versions of its products got her much
 attention, as did her promotion <http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/2008/10/how-could-stanl.html> of
 a screed claiming that President Barack Obama was the illegitimate lovechild of Malcolm X.
      Geller had never earned a living as a journalist. She supported herself with millions of dollars in a divorce
 settlement and life insurance money from her ex-husband. He died in 2008, a year after being indicted
 <http://www.nypost.com/p/news/regional/item_ufV12j9XnA9Qn0Ukjs8Q1M> for an alleged $1.3 million scam he was
 accused of running out of a car dealership he co-owned with Geller. Independently wealthy and with time on her hands,
 Geller proved able indeed when it came to exploiting her strange media stardom to incite the already organized political
 network of Islamophobes to intensify their crusade.

     She also benefited from close alliances with leading Islamophobes from Europe. Among Geller's allies was Andrew
Gravers, a Danish activist who formed the group Stop the Islamicization of Europe, and gave it
<http://www.loonwatch.com/2010/07/sioa-is-an-anti-muslim-hate-group/> the unusually blunt motto: "Racism is the
lowest form of human stupidity, but Islamophobia is the height of common sense." Gravers' group inspired Geller's own
U.S.-based outfit, Stop the Islamicization of America <http://sioaonline.com/>, which she formed with her friend Robert
Spencer, a pseudo-scholar whose bestselling books, including The Truth About Muhammad, Founder of the World's
Most Intolerant Religion, prompted former advisor to President Richard Nixon and Muslim activist Robert Crane to call
him <http://smearcasting.com/smear_spencer.html>, "the principal leader... in the new academic field of Muslim
bashing." (According to the website Politico <http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=D979BED4-18FE-7082-
A8314DD53412ADF8> , almost $1 million in donations from Chernick has been steered to Spencer's Jihad Watch group
through David Horowitz's Freedom Center.)
     Perfect sources for Republican political figures in search of the next hot-button cause, their rhetoric found its way
into the talking points of Newt Gingrich and Sarah Palin as they propelled the crusade against Cordoba House into the
national spotlight. Gingrich soon compared <http://www.mediaite.com/online/newt-gingrich-compares-ground-zero-
islamic-center-to-nazi-sign-next-to-holocaust-museumh the community center to a Nazi sign next to the Holocaust
Memorial Museum, while Palin called it "a stab in the heart" of "the Heartland." Meanwhile, Tea Party candidates like
Republican Ilario Pantano, an Iraq war veteran who killed <http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/26/us-veteran-
killed-iraqis-tea-party> two unarmed Iraqi civilians, shooting them 60 times -- he even stopped to reload -- made their
opposition <http://www.pantanoforcongress.com/posts/video-ilario-pantano-at-the-9-11-rally-of-remembrance> to
Cordoba House the centerpiece of midterm congressional campaigns conducted hundreds of miles from Ground Zero.
     Geller's campaign against "the mosque at Ground Zero" gained an unexpected assist and a veneer of legitimacy
from established Jewish leaders like Anti-Defamation League National Director Abraham Foxman. "Survivors of the
Holocaust are entitled to feelings that are irrational," he remarked
<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/31/nyregion/31mosque.html> to the New York Times. Comparing the bereaved
family members of 9-11 victims to Holocaust survivors, Foxman insisted, "Their anguish entitles them to positions that
others would categorize as irrational or bigoted."
      Soon enough, David Harris, director of the (Chernick-funded) American Jewish Committee, was demanding
<http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/08/03/american jewish_committee_also_opposes_mosque/> that
Cordoba's leaders be compelled to reveal their "true attitudes" about Palestinian militant groups before construction on
the center was initiated. Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center of Los Angeles, another major Jewish group,
insisted it would be "insensitive" for Cordoba to build near "a cemetery," though his organization had recently been
granted permission from the municipality of Jerusalem to build
<http://www.alzaytouna.net/arabic/?c=1519&a=116500> a "museum of tolerance" to be called The Center for Human
Dignity directly on top of the Mamilla Cemetery, a Muslim graveyard that contained thousands of gravesites dating back
1,200 years.
      Inspiration from Israel
      It was evident from the involvement of figures like Gravers that the Islamophobic network in the United States
represented a trans-Atlantic expansion of simmering resentment in Europe. There, the far-right was storming to
victories in parliamentary elections across the continent in part by appealing to the simmering anti-Muslim sentiments
of voters in rural and working-class communities. The extent of the collaboration between European and American
Islamophobes has only continued to grow with Geller, Spencer, and even Gingrich standing beside Europe's most
prominent anti-Muslim figure, Dutch parliamentarian Geert Wilders, at a rally against Cordoba House. In the meantime,
Geller was issuing statements of support <http://maxblumenthal.com/2010/03/so-who-are-the-nazis-meet-atlass-
thugs/> for the English Defense League, a band of unreconstructed neo-Nazis
<http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/features/English-Defence-League-Hooligans-Unmasked.php> and former members
of the whites-only British National Party who intimidate Muslims in the streets of cities like Birmingham and London.
      In addition, the trans-Atlantic Islamophobic crusade has stretched into Israel, a country that has come to symbolize
the network's fight against the Muslim menace. As Geller told the New York Times' Alan Feuer, Israel is "a very good
guide because, like I said, in the war between the civilized man and the savage, you side with the civilized man."
      EDL members regularly wave <http://www.loonwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/edl_israel_flag.jpg>
 Israeli flags at their rallies, while Wilders claims to have formed his views about Muslims during the time he worked on
 an Israeli cooperative farm in the 1980s. He has, he says, visited the country more than 40 times since to meet with
<http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/141007 > rightist political allies like Aryeh Eldad, a member of

the Israeli Knesset and leader of the far right Hatikvah faction of the National Union Party. He has called for forcibly
"transferring" the Palestinians living in Israel and the occupied West Bank to Jordan and Egypt. On December 5th, for
example, Wilders traveled to Israel for a "friendly" meeting <http://www.rnw.nl/english/bulletin/geert-wilders-meets-
israeli-foreign-minister-lieberman> with Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, then declared
<http://www.rnw.nl/english/bulletin/minister-rejects-wilders-plea-palestinian-state-jordan> at a press conference that
Israel should annex the West Bank and set up a Palestinian state in Jordan.
      In the apocalyptic clash of civilizations the global anti-Muslim network has sought to incite, tiny armed Jewish
settlements like Yitzar, located on the hills above the occupied Palestinian city of Nablus, represent front-line fortresses.
Inside Yitzar's state-funded yeshiva <http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/akiva-eldar-u-s-tax-dollars-fund-
rabbi-who-excused-killing-gentile-babies-1.2137> , a rabbi named Yitzhak Shapira has instructed students in what rules
must be applied when considering killing non-Jews. Shapira summarized his opinions in a widely publicized book
<http://maxblumenthalcom/2010/08/how-to-kill-goyim-and-influence-people-leading-israeli-rabbis-defend-manual-
for-for-killing-non-jews/> , Torat HaMelech, or The King's Torah. Claiming that non-Jews are "uncompassionate by
nature," Shapira cited rabbinical texts to declare that gentiles could be killed in order to "curb their evil inclinations."
"There is justification," the rabbi proclaimed, "for killing babies if it is clear that they will grow up to harm us, and in such
a situation they may be harmed deliberately, and not only during combat with adults."
      In 2006, the rabbi was briefly held by Israeli police for urging his supporters to murder all Palestinians over the age
of 13. Two years later, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, he signed <http://www.haaretz.com/print-
edition/news/violence-follows-removal-of-trailer-from-west-bank-outpost-1.250450> a rabbinical letter in support of
Israeli Jews who had brutally assaulted two Arab youths on the country's Holocaust Remembrance Day. That same year,
Shapira was arrested as a suspect in helping orchestrate <http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/news/the-king-s-
torah-a-rabbinic-text-or-a-call-to-terror-1.261930> a rocket attack against a Palestinian village near Nablus.
      Though he was not charged, his name came up again in connection with another act of terror when, in January
2010, the Israeli police raided his settlement seeking vandals who had set fire to a nearby mosque. One of Shapira's
followers, an American immigrant, Jack Teitel <http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1934103,00.html> , has
confessed to murdering two innocent Palestinians and attempting to the kill the liberal Israeli historian Ze'ev Sternhell
with a mail bomb.
      What does all this have to do with Islamophobic campaigns in the United States? A great deal, actually. Through
New York-based tax-exempt non-profits like the Central Fund of Israel <http://www.haaretz.com/print-
edition/features/akiva-eldar-u-s-tax-dollars-fund-rabbi-who-excused-killing-gentile-babies-1.2137> and Ateret
Cohenim, for instance, the omnipresent Aubrey Chernick has sent tens of thousands of dollars to support the Yitzar
 settlement, as well as to the messianic settlers dedicated to "Judaizing" East Jerusalem. The settlement movement's
leading online news magazine, Arutz Sheva, has featured Geller as a columnist. A friend of Geller's, Beth Gilinsky, a
 right-wing activist with a group called the Coalition to Honor Ground Zero and the founder of the Jewish Action Alliance
 (apparently run <http://www.manta.com/c/mmzgtfs/jewish-action-alliance> out of a Manhattan real estate office),
 organized a large rally in New York City in April 2010 to protest the Obama administration's call for a settlement freeze.
      Among Chernick's major funding recipients is a supposedly "apolitical" group called Aish Hatorah that claims to
 educate Jews about their heritage. Based in New York and active in the fever swamps of northern West Bank
 settlements near Yitzar, Aish Hatorah shares an address and staff with a shadowy foreign non-profit called the Clarion
 Fund. During the 2008 U.S. election campaign, the Clarion Fund distributed
 <http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/J126Ak03.html> 28 million DVDs of a propaganda film called Obsession
 as newspaper inserts to residents of swing states around the country. The film featured a who's who of anti-Muslim
 activists, including Walid Shoebat, a self-proclaimed "former PLO terrorist." Among Shoebat's more striking statements:
 "A secular dogma like Nazism is less dangerous than is Islamofascism today." At a Christian gathering in 2007, this
 "former Islamic terrorist" told the crowd that Islam was a "satanic cult" and that he had been born again as an
 evangelical Christian. In 2008, however, the Jerusalem Post, a right-leaning newspaper, exposed him
 <http://www.jpost.com/Features/Article.aspx?id=96502> as a fraud, whose claims to terrorism were fictional.
       Islamophobic groups registered only a minimal impact during the 2008 election campaign. Two years later,
 however, after the Republicans regained control of the House of Representatives in midterm elections, the network
 appears to have reached critical mass. Of course, the deciding factor in the election was the economy, and in two years,
 Americans will likely vote their pocketbooks again. But that the construction of a single Islamic community center or the
 imaginary threat of Sharia law were issues at all reflected the influence of a small band of locally oriented activists, and
 suggested that when a certain presidential candidate who has already been demonized as a crypto-Muslim runs for

reelection, the country's most vocal Islamophobes could once again find a national platform amid the frenzied
atmosphere of the campaign.
     By now, the Islamophobic crusade has gone beyond the right-wing pro-Israel activists, cyber-bigots, and ambitious
hucksters who conceived it. It now belongs to leading Republican presidential candidates, top-rated cable news hosts,
and crowds of Tea Party activists. As the fervor spreads, the crusaders are basking in the glory of what they
accomplished. "I didn't choose this moment," Geller mused
<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/nyregion/10gellerb.html> to the New York Times, "this moment chose me."
