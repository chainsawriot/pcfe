                              Twas the Night Before the QDDR

                           Twas two weeks before Christmas, when all through the town
                            Breaths were held expectantly, in the midst of a countdown.
                           With their keyboards ready, the bloggers abandoned all care,
                                Hoping that Secretary Clinton soon would be there.

                                   The NGOs were nestled all snug in their beds,
                                      Knowing the QDDR soon would be read.
                                    And the Senate and House, with a sharp rap,
                                      Had just left town for a long winter's nap.

                                  When out on the Mall there arose such a clatter,
                        Aid analysts sprang from their cubicles to see what was the matter.
                                     Away to their lnboxes they flew like a flash,
                                   Tore open their emails and emptied the cache.

                                  The moon on the breast of the soon-to-fall snow
                               Gave the lustre of mid-day to the stalled traffic below.
                                When, what to their wondering eyes should appear,
                                   But an armored car, and eight men in full gear.

                                       With a diplomatic wit, married to Bill,
                                    They knew in a moment it must be St Hill.
                                 More rapid than eagles her people, they came,
                            And she whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!

                            "Now Slaughter! Now, Radelet! Now, Geithner and Shah!
                                On, Nides! On, Steinberg! On Yohannes, hurrah!
                               To the top of the White House! To the top of the Hill!
                                 Now dash away! Dash away! Get us good will!"

                                And then, in a flash, her people took to the phone
                                 Spreading the word about what few had known.
                            As the developmentistas gathered to find common ground,
                                Behind the podium St Hillary came with a bound.

                                Her eyes-how they twinkled! Her hair how flaxen!
                             Her cheeks were like roses, the cameras were flashin'!
                                   Her smart red suit was adorned with a bow,
                              The perfect "development diplomat" from head to toe.

                             She addressed the crowd on integration and elevation,
                                   And gave USAID some special designation!
                                    A wink of her eye and a twist of her head,
                            Soon let them dream that they had fewer things to dread.

                           She spoke many words, and expressed her complete vision,
                       While her colleagues set about implementing the QDDR's decision.
                                     And laying her finger aside of her nose,
                            And giving a nod, she departed, nothing else to disclose!

                                She sprang to her car, to her team gave a whistle,
                                 And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
                             But they heard her exclaim, 'ere she drove out of sight,
                                    "Just trust me on this, it will all be alright!"

May all your dreams come true, from your friends at the Rethinking U.S. Foreign Assistance initiative — Connie,
Sarah Jane, and Casey — and with many thanks for the creative talents of Casey Dunning and Julie Walz.
