I would like to update you on the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline. Pres. Berdimuhamedov has
been very active politically over the past several weeks. He has had several meetings of experts from the four countries
and will have a Summit of the leaders of the four countries in December.
