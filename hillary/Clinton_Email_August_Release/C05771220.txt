JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Hours before peace talks were set to begin in Washington, Jewish settlers announced plans to
launch new construction in their West Bank enclaves. Naftali Bennett, director of the settlers' YESHA council, said
settlers would begin building homes and public structures in at least 80 settlements, breaking a partial government
freeze on building that ends on Sept. 26.
