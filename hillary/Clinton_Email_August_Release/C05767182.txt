I think I mentioned to you that Carols Pascual has asked me to work with him on a public awareness campaign targeting
the Mexican public and designed to maintain support for the campaign against the drug cartels. The attached article,
which he wrote, addresses this issue. I have approached Keith Reinhard at Business for Diplomatic Action to work with
us on this matter. Keith thinks he can organize a US/Mexican creative coalition to work on it. Might be an interesting
model for Haiti if it works here.

Hope the trip is going well.

JM
