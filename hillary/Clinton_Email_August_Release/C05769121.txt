Subject:                          Cathy Ashton



As I mentioned last week, I was on a panel at the Brussels forum with Lady Ashton (who insisted everyone call her
Cathy), Estonian president Toomas lives, and Senator Voinovich. Ashton and I essentially reinforced each other at every
turn and presented a very positive vision of US-EU partnership. She has scored some significant victories lately, most
notably that development will be included in the European Action Service (EAS) rather than sitting at a separate desk
(the formula we are seeking rather than the DFID formula). EU defense staff will also be included in the EAS. Indeed,
Ashton chairs the European Council whenever the 27 foreign ministers, development ministers, or defense ministers
meet -- the ultimate integrated frame. She also has control over a number of the smaller development and state-
building budgets, though I gather the biggest development fund is still in dispute between her and the development
commissioner. Apparently, however, the enlargement commissioner took his cues from her on strategy and policy and
then presented his implementation plans to the Council, which is the role she wants. We should be able to build on the
way the EU is organizing in pushing pushing our own integrated frame here.




I hope everything goes well on Ottawa and NY. Bob Hormats and I will send a note on other aspects of Brussels forum,
where US was well represented. AM
