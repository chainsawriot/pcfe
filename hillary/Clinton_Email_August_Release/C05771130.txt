I don't want to keep you hanging all evening. I will spare you the excuses; we think we can have
you something by 9:00. In some ways it's getting rougher before it's getting smoother, as we get the
top right and add examples. But it would be very good to have you engage again to make sure we
are going in the right direction. This draft also benefits from extensive comments from Jack, Raj,
and Jake. AM
