  The Secretary's Call with Democratic Unionist Party Leader Peter Robinson


 Background

 DUP Leader Peter Robinson is threatening to resign as First Minister and thereby
 force elections if the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) does not vote in favor of
 devolution on March 9. UUP leader Sir Reg Empey continues to withhold his
 support for the Hillsborough Agreement, citing complaints about the functioning of
 the Executive and demanding movement on educational reform; an outcome that
 would benefit him electorally. Even though a UUP "yes" is not required for the
 vote to pass, Robinson has said that Empey's support is an essential component of
 "community confidence" in the deal, and that a "no" vote by the UUP on March 9
 would prompt him to resign as First Minister, force new elections to seek a
 unionist mandate for devolution. Such an outcome would effectively scuttle the
 Hillsborough Agreement and severely harm both local and international confidence
 in Northern Ireland's political institutions. Robinson feels strongly that the DUP
 would "hammer" the UUP in an Assembly election, while we understand that the
 UUP has done polling which would indicate significant gains for them against a
 scandal-ridden and weakened DUP. Sinn Fein feels both parties are
 miscalculating.

 Empey's focus on getting some concession on education to "save" the
 Hillsborough Agreement focuses pressure on education ministerial portfolio-holder
 Sinn Fein; Robinson and the DUP have refused to discuss the impasse on
 education. However, should Robinson resign forcing early Assembly elections,
 both the DUP and UUP will undoubtedly seek to shift blame to Sinn Fein for their
 inability to compromise on this issue. Sinn Fein and the DUP have met with
 Empey numerous times in recent days to discuss ways forward, although no
 agreement has yet been reached. Regardless of Empey's behavior, Robinson, who
 is still exhibiting signs of weak leadership within his party, still holds the key to
 the March 9 outcome.
