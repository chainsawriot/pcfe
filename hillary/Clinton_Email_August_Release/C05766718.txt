                                                     You have been so instrumental in all that the Secretary has been able
to accomplish in creating her team that I cannot imagine we will live up to the std you have set - not to mention how
enormously we will miss you.

Let's talk after the meeting and welcome any reommendations for who could begin to try to do what you do.

Best

Cdm

Cheryl,

I've come to a point where I feel that I have to set a firm date for my departure from the State Department




 I would like to wrap up everything in a responsible way at State and USAID, and I think I can do it by the end of
 February. I hope you and I can discuss this after the meeting that Cynthia and I have with you at 5:00 on Monday, but
 let me know if there's a better time early next week.
