Subject: Japan Open Skies

We initialled the text of an Open Skies Agreement with Japan at about 10 tonight. I owe enormous thanks to so many of
you for a true team victory. From Secretary Clinton on the seventh floor to my tireless secretary in EEB, Tucker
Richmond Stewart, we pulled together to make a bit of aviation history and, much more important, to do something
good for our consumers, communities, and national economy.

I was able to contact the offices of about ten key Senators and Members of Congress before the signing, with a focus on
those who, with a strong Delta presence at home, had expressed concerns about proceeding. I stressed that we'd
negotiated provisions that offer Delta assurances of fairness and the potential to grow. I also emphasized that the
decision to proceed was taken only after careful consideration at very senior levels of State, DOT, and White House.

Thanks, again, to all for your support.

John Byerly




With help I'll make more calls next week and will arrange briefings for all who are interested.
