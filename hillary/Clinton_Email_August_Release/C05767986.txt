Subject: RE:

The Program would be Chairman Kerry to Lugar to WJC to Gates. Statements followed by questions from the Senators.
They would expect nearly every Senator would attend if WJC confirmed. The topic of the hearing is "Building on
Success: New Directions in Global Health" Also testifying after WJC / Gates would be a second panel of Second Panel:
USAID Administrator Dr. Rajiv Shah and U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator, Ambassador Eric Goosby. They would like WIC to
speak on the public / private partnerships, where the US and Intl Community is, the importance of our work Because bi-
partisan coalition on HIV/AIDS is becoming increasingly fragile with the poor economy.

Goals of the hearing from the committee:
The objective of the hearing is to discuss the progress that has been made in global health and to ask where we should
go from here. How do we build on remarkable but sometimes compartmentalized successes? Questions for
consideration include:
What are the key opportunities and challenges?
In a constrained budget environment, how can public and private partners maximize the life-saving impact and cost
effectiveness of health programs?
The United States has led the way in supporting path-breaking bilateral and multilateral HIV/AIDS programs. How can
we best maintain and expand that work while creating a more holistic and integrated approach to global health?
What does it mean in practical terms to focus on women and girls and how can this approach yield new results?
Health systems are more than the sum of their parts. How can public and private partners most effectively help
countries create the capacity to deliver health service
