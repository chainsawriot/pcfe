Subject: NYT Pre-Brief

I do not anticipate surprises this morning. The biggies will be the focus â€” Iran (engagement, hikers, eight in custody),
Afghanistan (elections, corruption, shift in approach to Karzai), MEPP (overcoming settlement moratorium), Iraq
(government formation), China (broad relations, spat with Japan, currency), Russia (START) and North Korea. Beyond
that, there is great sympathy within the editorial board regarding Haiti and a front page story today about the concerns
of Haitians in camps who are frustrated with the pace of the recovery. This being New York, I can easily see the mosque
coming up.
