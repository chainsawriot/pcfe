Subject: Lieberman Legislation

We did a couple of holding actions today regarding this legislation. The Secretary said we have the authority to do what
is called expatriation. US citizenship is a privilege not a right. Where you swear to uphold duties to our Constitution.
Those who support terrorism are in violation in the Secretary's opinion. We will take a hard look at what is proposed. At
the podium, I said that there were issues regarding due process and that Americans would be concerned if citizenship
were revoked before as opposed to after a legal proceeding.
