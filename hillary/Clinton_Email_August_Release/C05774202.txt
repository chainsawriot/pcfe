Mark--thanks for the offer of help. I'd appreciate anything you can to do assist w the completion of the American
Pavilion. I am copying Kris Balderston, who is working on the Expo project for me, and asking him to contact you to
follow up. All the best.

Wondering why no one called me since I have probably 20 clients from Ford, Microsoft, Intel, HP, Dell all very interested
in Shanghai Expo as well as 100 people in China.




Kind of late but happy to help if someone still needs anything.
