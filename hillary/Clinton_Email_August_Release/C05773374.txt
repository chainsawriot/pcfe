Subject: Israeli air strikes target Gaza after rocket fire (Reuters)

GAZA (Reuters) - Israel carried out a series of air strikes in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian Authority officials and
witnesses said, after militants from the Hamas-ruled territory fired rockets into southern Israel. No one was
reported killed in any of the attacks. The Israeli strikes targeted a Hamas training camp, where two gunmen
were wounded, smuggling tunnels along Gaza's border with Egypt, and other, unpopulated areas, Hamas
officials and witnesses said. An Israeli military spokeswoman, who was checking that report, said 13 rockets
were fired from Gaza into Israel in the past two days. None of the attacks caused any injuries. Hamas leaders
have tried to curb rocket fire at Israel, but smaller groups continue to carry out such attacks. Israel's military
said more than 200 cross-border missiles, rockets and mortars have been fired from Gaza this year. An air strike
in Gaza on December 18 killed five militants from a rocket launching squad.
