Re: NI/tactic works


The plan worked perfectly. Gordon made the speech in the late afternoon. Cameron felt compelled to support
both the deal and the timing. Shaun called Lou Susman beforehand and Susman made a helpful call to Cameron
"seeking clarification" an hour and a half before the event.

Now, Reg Empey is boxed in. He's considering his position. It may be that you will have to call him in a couple
days.

Shaun will call you tomorrow at a time convenient to you.
