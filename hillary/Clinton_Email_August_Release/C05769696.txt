Subject: US-EU statement on human rights in Iran

The EU has agreed to issue the joint statement on human rights situation in Iran with support of all 27 member
states. Text they approved is below. They will issue as European Union. Can we issue as "The USG" or "the
United States"? (Had been discussion of HRC-Ashton but they want to put in names of EU and US.) Hope is
to get it out today.




                                       JOINT STATEMENT
                 BY THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
                            CALLING ON THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT
                           TO FULFIL ITS HUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS

The United States and the European Union condemn the continuing human rights violations in Iran since the June
12 election. The large scale detentions and mass trials, the threatened execution of protestors, the intimidation of
family members of those detained and the continuing denial to its citizens of the right to peaceful expressi oI n are
contrary to human rights norms.

Our concerns are based on our commitment to universal respect for human rights. We are particularly concerned
by the potential for further violence and repression during the coming days, especially around the anniversary of
the Islamic Republic's founding on 11 February. We call on the Government of Iran to live up to its international
human rights obligations, to end its abuses against its own people, to hold accountable those who have committed
the abuses and to release those who are exercising their rights.
