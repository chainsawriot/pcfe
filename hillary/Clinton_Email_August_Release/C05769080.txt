Jake, Jack is to call Palau's president iater today, presurnabiy to unveii and push a new free assoclation aid proposal. The
arocosai can succeed or fail depending upon how it is handled and flexibiiity in working out cletaii.
The amount has been discussed as $250 million .thrki FY24 -- and ; think that -.amount could be made to work -- but it is
handicapped by a bl ,",sin to take out of that 1;) to $18.75 rri foi- the other two freely es,.:dciated states and count ';')13.3 m
already appropriated funding. Most
important is a willingness to sit down and mutually work out terms.
As I've said, I think the Compact Review can succeed if there is real
dialogue vs. 'This is it' proposais. It is also critIcai to
understand Pres. Toriblong astutely          up a small tf,arn of key Palau inadiers for the Rciviw to ensure that a proposai
can sain fuiianpnPval in Palau and he and they are i,ivorkins in complete. unison. Jeff
