As you know, the US Global leadership Coalition is hosting Secretaries Clinton, Gates, Geithner etal on Tuesday
afternoon for a formal discussion/announcement of new development initiatives. I am currently the chair of the
education arm (501c3) of this organization, and will be opening the session with very brief and general welcoming
remarks, then turning it over to Liz Schrayer who is the leader of the group. Just an fyi.
