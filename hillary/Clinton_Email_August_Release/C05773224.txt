                              Congo's Enough Moment:
             The Case for Conflict Minerals Certification and Army Reform

As a growing consumer movement demands cell phones and gadgets that are guaranteed
not to fuel atrocities in eastern Congo, there is an opportunity to end the exploitation of
Congo's people and the pillaging of its resources.

In a new report, "Congo's Enough Moment: The Case for Conflict Minerals
Certification and Army Reform," Enough Project Co-founder John Prendergast argues
that growing international attention to Congo and widespread interest in conflict minerals
has shined a spotlight on eastern Congo, opening a significant window for policy reform.

"The new U.S. law on conflict minerals and the growing global campaign have shaken up
the supply chain, and all those that are profiting say they are willing to change," says
Prendergast. "It is time for the U.S. government and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to
help leverage the end of the war in eastern Congo through leadership on two of the issues
that will catalyze a broader solution to the cycles of violence there: minerals certification
and comprehensive army reform."
