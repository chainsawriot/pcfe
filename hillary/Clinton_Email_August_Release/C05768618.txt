Great! We will start working on how to connect these issues thematically, beginning with CARE speech. Maybe can

I like this idea.




I like even better that we have a nutrition speech coming up which bridges GHI and GHFSI and we could use it as a venue

development to political stability and more. This trilogy of speeches (with the right PR) could further underscore our
elevation of development AND our comprehensive, smart power approach to foreign policy. After all, food, water, and
health are the sine qua non of human progress. And this is a Hillary Clinton signature idea, at least to me. Thoughts?
