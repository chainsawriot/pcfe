With regard to the two tops, I agree that Lissa's original top was more elegant, but Jim thought, and Jake and I agreed,
that the piece is not as compelling as it could be if we could be clearer about what you actually see coming down the
road that informs your focus on modernizing diplomacy (e.g., you see the proliferation of foundations, corporations,
ngos in the world as an opportunity, particularly given that we have more problems to deal with with the same
bandwidth, so you want to start training people now to do public private partnerships; or you see public opinion as
steadily increasing in importance, so we have to be doing public engagement in a big way). I tried to do that quickly in
the following graph, but w/o being able to draw all the connections.

Thx for the good additions and clarifications and I'd like to do a conf call whenever convenient. Can you give me time(s)
so I can plan?

Also, I think the beginning from last night (draft 20)reads better than the one in the last version (draft 22). Are there
specific points or phrases or sequencing from 22 that you believe should be added to 20?
