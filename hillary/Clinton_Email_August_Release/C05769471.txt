It's actually not too far past Richmond/Lynchburg so a late afternoon/evening trip is realistic. We can discuss tomorrow
and give you a recommendation.

Sidney

On a rainy, gloomy Sunday I write to you in the hope that we will have agreement from Secretary Clinton to accept the
"distinguished Diplomat" award at VMI. I am assured by the Superintendent, General JHB Peay, and the department
head of International Relations/Political Science, Colonel Jim Hentz that the award is hers if she will accept it. This is a
"done deal."

All that is needed for her to receive an official letter from General Peay is for me to know that she will accept the award.
They want to give her the award this year on a suitable day before graduation in late May. The letter will ask her to
address the corps of cadets in a suitable on post (campus) setting. I would like to see it in Jackson Memorial Hall, a
beautiful medieval revival building. An alternative setting would be the two story atrium in the Marshall Center for

Leadership and Ethics. The award would be presented at the end of the address. Media coverage would be welcomed
and assisted. She would be honored by being the reviewing person at a regimental review of the corps. A suitable
dinner and or luncheon would be arranged.

If this is going to happen it would be a good idea to set the wheels in motion as soon as possible so that the staffs can
work out the details.

Best
