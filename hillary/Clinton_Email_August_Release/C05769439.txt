Subject:                         Statement on Syrian human rights activists for review



NEA is asking for a statement from you on the sentencing of Syrian human rights activists. White House released a
statement on this. Draft below:



Statement by Secretary Clinton

Syrian Convictions of Human Rights Activists

The sentencing of Syrian lawyer Haitham Maleh to three years in prison is an example of Syria's failure to comply with
minimum international human rights standards. Convicting Maleh for exercising free speech and defending universal
human rights sends a clear message to the world that Syria does not tolerate peaceful forms of expression. We call on
the Syrian government to meet its responsibilities under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It
should demonstrate its commitment to international legal norms by releasing Maleh and other Syrian citizens, including
Muhannad al-Hassani and Ali Abdullah, who have been imprisoned solely for seeking to exercise their most fundamental
human rights.
