Subject: (AP) Pakistani officials: US missiles kill 4 in vehicle

MIR ALI (AP) â€” Pakistani intelligence officials say suspected U.S. missiles have killed four alleged militants as they were
driving in a vehicle near the Afghan border. The officials said unmanned drones fired two missiles November 19 on a
vehicle near Marsi Khel village in North Waziristan. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not
authorized to release the information. The strike is the ninth attack this month by unmanned drones in Pakistan's
lawless border region, which is dominated by Taliban and al-Qaida-linked fighters.
