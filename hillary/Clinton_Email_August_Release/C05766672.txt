Because of time difference, reaching all the embassies is challenging but I can type up something quickly and send
somethig latter this afternoon so long as you know its all completely tentative.
lm doing a call in a few minutes with
                                                   and then have a call with phil Gordon to review EUR priorities cause we
will be in Europe in less than a month, and it turns out that merkel is less flexible with dates than we thought.
