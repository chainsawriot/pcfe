You are correct - Eric Boswell is A/5 for Diplomatic Security. Jeff Culver is the Director of DS. I apologize for the mistake.

I have added Goldwyn and corrected Boswell. It takes about a week to have a notebook printed. Would you like me to
go ahead and place an order or wait for more changes/until you use the current stock?

In the next printing pls add David Goldwyn to Envoys & Others. He is International Energy Coordinator.

Also I thought Eric Boswell not Jeffrey ? Was head of DS. Pls let me know. Thx.
