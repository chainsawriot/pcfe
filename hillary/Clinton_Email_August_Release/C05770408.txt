Hi Cheryl,

The U.S.-China dialogue on Latin American issues began in 2006 during the Bush administration, led by Tom Shannon,
and recurred in 2007 and 2008. My trip to China will be the first such dialogue to take place during the Obama
administration
                                                                                                                China is
now a top-three trading partner of many Latin American countries and is in fact the number one trading partner of Brazil,
as well as being a donor member of the Inter-American Development Bank and observer at the Organization of American
States.

The purpose of these talks is three-fold: to inform the Chinese of our policy priorities in the Americas, to learn about their
views on the region, and to explore potential areas of cooperation in the areas of economic and social development. In
addition to the formal meetings with government officials, I will also be meeting with Latin American diplomats, Chinese
academics and private sector groupings.

Our dialogue with China on Latin America is one of three sub-dialogues that are part of the broader U.S.-China strategic
framework to ensure that the bilateral relationship is positive, cooperative, and comprehensive. The others are the China-
Africa talks that AF hosted in Washington last month and the dialogue on South and Central Asia.

Best, Arturo
