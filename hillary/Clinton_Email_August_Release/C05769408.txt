Eric, Elizabeth,

Attached is what I drafted for the Secretary. It is pretty straightforward; lifted more or less from their website. To the
extent that you have editorial commentary, please send it our way. I'll be traveling with S on Monday for the Montreal
conference and we expect the trust fund concept to be a big topic of conversation. S is very interested in using Aceh
Fund as a model.

Meghann
