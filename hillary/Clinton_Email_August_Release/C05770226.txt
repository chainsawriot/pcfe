UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770226 Date: 08/31/2015



                                                                           RELEASE IN FULL




              NDI Kenya Referendum Update August 4, 2010


  Current Political Situation
     • Referendum day enthusiasm: was very high as evidenced by the high voter
         turnout. Some Kenyans came out at 3:00am to participate — polls opened at
         6:00am. There has not been a single reported incidence of violence.

     • Security: There has been a marked increase in security as compared with the
         2007 elections. There are more military personnel in the polling stations and
         more police presence. There is a particularly high military/police presence in
         potential trouble areas like the Rift Valley.

     • Political good will: Media coverage (both state-run and private) indicates that
         most Kenyans have been impressed by the IIEC's transparency, regular updates
         to the public, and have applauded their efforts to address challenges as they have
         occurred.


  Citizen Participation
     • Voter Turnout: Voter turn-out appears high (some polling stations had
         reported that more than 50% of registered voters had voted by mid-day). The
         IIEC has said that turnout was 60% at 3pm with two hours of voting still to go.

     • The Church Mobilization: The "No" vote was largely mobilized by religious
         organizations and churches. Thousands of voters turned-out in areas that are
         thought to be supportive of the NO campaign. The final public statement issued
         by the NO campaign going into the referendum encouraged Kenyans to vote and
         called for peaceful polls. However, there were troubling signs contained within
         the statement as well. For instance, the statement read in part: "We are aware
         that the government has put an elaborate strategy together to rig the
         referendum... We will reject the results of the referendum if we find that
         government has operationalized its rigging plans." The NO campaign statement
         further stated that "Americans are using Kenya as an experiment of their new
         method of destabilizing and manipulating African nations. If we as Kenyans allow
         Americans to influence us and manipulate our new constitution, we shall have set
         the way for other African nations to similarly be manipulated." It does not
         appear that some elements are prepared for a loss at the polls. This does not
         mean that the religious leadership or its supporters will result to violence. This

        may not be true of some politically motivated elements with the NO campaign
        structure. However, William Ruto has now delivered a statement stating that he
        will accept the results. This may be driven by the strong messages of support for
        the IIEC from Kenyan citizens which have been aired by the media all day which
        make it more difficult for anyone choosing to undermine their results.

 IIEC Performance
        Voter Registry Problems: There have been some incidences of
        misspelled names on the register — with proper identification most citizens were
        still allowed to vote at most polling stations despite minor spelling errors.
        However, these problems do not appear to be on a scale that could undermine the
        credibility of the process overall.

     • Materials Distribution Challenges: Throughout the country, most of
        the polling stations received their ballot materials. Most of the polling stations
        opened on time (06:00 am) or shortly thereafter. Ballot materials in Tana River
        were lost once the IIEC's canoes leaked but no one was hurt and the commission
        stated they would get materials to the center later in the day. There have been a
        few complaints by the "no" camp that ballot papers were inappropriately colored
        at some stations (they were orange) — the IIEC responded by stating they would
        attempt to replace the papers in the affected areas.

     • Commissioners' Optimism. NDI held a brief "off the record" meeting
       with the Chair of the IIEC and later with most of the IIEC Commissioners. In
       both meetings there was acknowledgement of the challenges that the commission
       had faced during the first half of the election-day but there was also a visible level
       of optimism among the Commissioners that the process was generally being seen
       as an open, transparent and participatory one. The Commission has issued two
       statements thus far. Both are attached to this update.

     • Announcement of Results. Officially IIEC has 48 hours from the close
         of polls (17:00 today) to release results (pushing the deadline to 17:00 Friday,
         Kenya team). However, the IIEC is releasing interim results by polling station
         and the team thinks the picture will be clear as early as tomorrow morning. If the
         process proceeds smoothly, it is likely that the PVT results will be announced
         after the IIEC's interim results but before the official results.

 Election Observers
     • Domestic Observers. The IIEC says that it certified 41 domestic election
        observation groups totaling close to 30,000 observers. NDI's partner, the
        Election Observation Group (ELOG) is fielding more than 10,000 observers. 702
        of the ELOG observers are dedicated to the PVT exercise. ELOG issued two
        statements today (both are attached).

     • International Observers. There are at least three international observer
        missions in Kenya for the referendum. The missions are from the
        Commonwealth (3 observers) that were not deployed outside of Nairobi; the East
        Africa Community (EAC) delegation is also a small one (8 observers) and is
        headed by EALA member, Hon. Leonce Ndarubagiye from Burundi; and the
        European Union has an "informal presence" in Nairobi. Last week the EU
        released a statement praising the IIEC's preparations for the referendum. The
        African Union has also sent an observation mission. Finally, a number of
        Embassies deployed staff "observers" throughout the country.

     • "Yes" and "No" Polling Station Agents. Observers from the both
         campaigns were out in force. According to the ELOG (PVT) observers YES and
         NO observers were present in close to 68% of the polling centers visited. They are
         allowed 1 per committee per polling station. With 8 committees the maximum
         could be as much as 240,000 agents. NDI trained the constituency chief agents
         for all 8 committees and the PVT qualitative results show that only 7% of polling
         stations did not have agents present at the opening. Some No observers have
         raised concerns about inappropriately colored ballot papers (they were orange).
         Otherwise, there have been no serious complaints reported by either side. Some
         have also made claims that they were prevented from operating but claims of this
         type have been sporadic, rather than systematic. There have also been claims
         from the No side that the heavy police presence in the Rift Valley is designed to
         intimidate their voters but this has not been backed by feedback from the public
         at large as aired by the media.

     • Regional Liaison Observers: There are 20 regional liaison observers
         throughout the country - all of their reports have been positive and indicate that
         the process was smooth and there has been no violence. There have been a few
         minor problems on the register. At present they are observing the tallying
         process.

  The ELOG PVT Exercise
  ELOGs PVT operation faced some challenges early in the day because observers were
  either prevented from entering the polling station or had their phones confiscated. This
  was the result of poor internal communication within the IIEC which prevented helpful
  decisions made by the Commission filtering down to Presiding Officers on the ground.

  The IIEC has been helpful during the day in resolving at least some of these problems.
  By 7pm text messages had been received from all but a few PVT observers (96% of the
  first message and 94% of the second message). ELOG have been able to use reports from
  their observers in a representative sample of polling stations to draw conclusions about
  the overall process across the country.
  On opening, they reported that:
     - 99% of polling stations were set up for secret voting
     - l00% of polling stations had ballot boxes which were empty prior to being sealed
     - 96% of polling stations had no key materials missing
     - 98% of polling stations were open by 7.15am
  On the voting process they reported:
     - 99% of polling stations reported no attempts to disrupt the voting process
     - 98% of polling stations had no cases of voters not being inked
     - 84% of polling stations had no cases of voters being allowed to vote without an ID
       or without their name on the register
     - 42% had no cases of voters not being permitted to vote (because they were not
       registered), 55% had a few cases (1-14) and 3% had some cases (15-49)
     - The only issue observed which is difficult to interpret without additional
       information is the incidence of assisted voting. 5% reported no cases; 27%
       reported a few cases; 47% reported some cases and 22% reported many cases (50
       or more).

     Overall, ELOG has received 162 critical incident reports from its entire 10,000+
     cadre of observers. Of these, 111 were observers not being permitted to observe.



  NDI Mapping Update: NDI has provided maps to visualize critical incidence to
  Elections Observation Group (ELOG). NDI also provided routing maps that pinpointed
  polling stations to IIEC who used them to assist the foreign media and their own staff
  and to observers from the US and several European embassies.

  Challenges Ahead
      • Release of the results: The IIEC's wish to show the results from all
         27,000 polling stations in real time has proved to be over ambitious. However,
         the counting is going well and there should not be significant delays in the overall
         reporting process.

      • Acceptance of the results:              Perhaps the biggest fear is that the "No"
         camp is not going to accept the results and this will spark post-electoral violence
         (especially in the Rift Valley). So far there is no evidence that this will occur.
         However, the point of greatest danger is after the announcement of the results,
         not before. So far as the political leader of the No side, William Ruto, is
         concerned, the results in Rift Valley are at least as important as the national total.
         If the No side has performed as well as expected there, he may not have an
         interest in seeking to undermine the credibility of the tallying and reporting
         process.
