Subject: excerpt from Julian Assange live online Q and A with the Guardian today




I am a former British diplomat. In the course of my former duties I helped to coordinate multilateral action against a
brutal regime in the Balkans, impose sanctions on a renegade state threatening ethnic cleansing, and negotiate a
debt relief programme for an impoverished nation. None of this would have been possible without the security and
secrecy of diplomatic correspondence, and the protection of that correspondence from publication under the laws of
the UK and many other liberal and democratic states. An embassy which cannot securely offer advice or pass
messages back to London is an embassy which cannot operate. Diplomacy cannot operate without discretion and the
protection of sources. This applies to the UK and the UN as much as the US.

In publishing this massive volume of correspondence, Wikileaks is not highlighting specific cases of wrongdoing but
undermining the entire process of diplomacy. If you can publish US cables then you can publish UK telegrams and UN
emails.

My question to you is: why should we not hold you personally responsible when next an international crisis goes
unresolved because diplomats cannot function.

Julian Assange:
If you trim the vast editorial letter to the singular question actually asked, I would be happy to give it my attention.
