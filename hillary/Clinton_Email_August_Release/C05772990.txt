  First, Happy New Year to you and your family and thank you for all of your great work this past year. I am looking
forward to the year ahead.

 Second, what can we do about Judge Urbina's ruling                                                             For    B5
example, what is the likelihood of success on appeal? Can the US file a civil action against the company? Pay
compensation to the victims? What other options do we have?

 All the best, H
