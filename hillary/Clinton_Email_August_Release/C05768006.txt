Not if they say there have been problems which they were addressing before the quake and w outside help will continue
and achieve their reform agenda.

Trying - they are a bit mad on two proper grounds - will make other donors less likel to give and our congress less likely
to give

I have not seen nor reviewed that report and it was not flagged for me.

Adding Jake and mike posner to advise - esp re process of vetting w/ embassy given the profile of the work we are doing
w/ them.

Cheryl,

     Local media drew attention this weekend to the line in the introduction of our annual human rights report that
refers to the GOH by saying that there is severe corruption in all branches of government,                   called this
morning asking for a copy of the report (which we sent him), saying that the President was upset and wanted to read it.
The Embassy human rights officer sent the Department a first draft of this report late last year. It normally would have
gone through two or three more versions with input from DRL and ultimately clearance by the Embassy Front Office.
Because our Human Rights officer (Kathey-Lee Galvin) was seriously injured in the quake, DRL took it upon themselves to
finish the report. The final draft was never sent to us for clearance/comments and I don't know who all in the
Department cleared off on it. You may already be familiar with the report, but in the event you are not. I wanted you to
have a copy in advance of meetings in Santo Domingo where you may hear about it from                             Cheers,
David
