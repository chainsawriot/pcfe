Subject: (AP) Palestinians critical of U.S. settlement proposal

JERUSALEM (AP) - Palestinians are expressing strong reservations about a U.S. proposal meant to entice Israel to
reinstate limits on West Bank settlement construction and revive peace talks. Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat did not
reject the proposal outright, but said a decision on whether to endorse it would be made after consultations with
Palestinian and Arab leaders. Erekat says the Palestinians "have a major problem in not including east Jerusalem."
