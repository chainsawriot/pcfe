Re: NI breakthrough

Shaun has just called meâ€”about 9 p.m. EST. He says it is very likely that an agreement will be announced on Monday.
The parties have reached agreement tonight. Shaun will call you on Sunday to brief. Gordon will fly into Belfast on
Monday for a ceremony if all goes according to plan now. He will mention your role. You should be prepared to speak to
the parties before the event and issue a statement. Hope it doesn't come unraveled over the next 36 hours.
