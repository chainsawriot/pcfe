WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate confirmed Jacob Lew as director of the Office of Management and Budget after a
Louisiana senator lifted a hold on his nomination. Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu had held up Lew's confirmation to
protest the administration's six-month moratorium on deepwater oil and gas drilling in the Gulf. She said that "notable
progress has been made" in her talks with the Interior Department and noted some permits have been issued in recent
weeks. The nomination was confirmed by voice vote.
