Thank you for such a lovely note.                                                                            Life
seems very sweet indeed this New Year's Day, and all the more so with the privilege of doing meaningful and important
work with a great team of people and a leader whom I am proud to serve. It has been quite a journey indeed, one that
has been hard at times, but immensely rewarding. Happy New Year, and here's to a great 2010.

Dear Anne-Marie,

 I was just reading your two wonderful memos on 5/ P accomplishments and the QDDR,




I also want to thank you for a wonderful year of work, creativity, collaboration and progress. I know the start for all of us
was shaky, but we have hit our stride and you are such a valuable member of the team, a generator of ideas, a
conductor of talent and even a necessary nudge from time to time. Thank you for making this journey w me.

I will schedule the S/P visit and photo as soon as I can. Until we see one another next week, be well and take care
(please!)

All the best, Hillary
