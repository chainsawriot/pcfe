Madame Secretary, here is what we have found thus far in terms of Republican voices encouraging the pastor to
reconsider.

PJ

Denounced the Koran Burning:

Sen. McCain on Twitter:
"Pastor Jones' threats to burn the Koran will put American service men/women in danger - for their sake
please don't do it!"
(http://twittercom/SenJohnMcCain)

Sarah Palin on Twitter and Facebook: "Koran Burning Is Insensitive, Unnecessary; Pastor Jones, Please Stand
Down"
(http://twittercom/SarahPalinUSA)
See Facebook statement: http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=427813493434

Rep. Boehner on ABC News: "just because you have a right to do something in America does not mean it is
the right thing to do....We're a nation of religious freedom. We're also a nation of tolerance. And I think in the
name of tolerance, people ought to really think about the kind of actions they're taking...I just think that it's
not wise to do this in the face of what our country really represents," said Boehner.

Gov. Barbour via ABC News: "I do not think well of the idea of burning anybody's Koran, or Bible, Book of
Mormon or anything else.... I don't think there's any excuse for it,"

Gov. Pawlenty via Minnesota Public Radio Report: "Gov. Tim Pawlenty says he doesn't think burning the
 Quran is a good idea, but he's not specifically calling on a Florida pastor to cancel a planned weekend protest.
 The Republican governor, who is viewed as a likely presidential candidate in 2012, commented on the Quran
 controversy today at an airport news conference before leaving on an Asian trade mission. Pawlenty said that
 people have a legal right to burn books, but that doesn't mean it's wise. He stopped short of saying the
 burning shouldn't go forward."

Former Gov. Romney via Politico: "Burning the Quran is wrong on every level," the former Massachusetts
governor said in a statement to POLITICO. "It puts troops in danger and it violates a founding principle of our
Republic."
