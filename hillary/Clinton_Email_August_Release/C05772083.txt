Hi Jake,
This does not have a direct foreign policy bearing, but I think S would be interested — because it is an enormous and
growing problem. These stats come from a NYT Op-Ed piece:

      •   Over 20% of California's debt issuance during 2009 and over 30% of its debt issuance in 2010 to date has been
          subsidized by the federal government in a program known as Build America Bonds. Under the program, the U.S.
          Treasury covers 35% of the interest paid by the bonds. Arguably, without this program the interest cost of bonds
          for some states would have reached prohibitive levels.
      •   "California is not alone: Over 30% of Illinois's debt and over 40% of Nevada's debt issued since 2009 has also
          been subsidized with these bonds. These states might have already reached some type of tipping point had the
          federal program not been in place."
      •   "Today, more than 28% of state funding comes from federal government transfers, the highest contribution on
          record. These transfers have made states dependent on federal assistance. New York, for example, spent in
          excess of 250% of its tax receipts over the last decade. The largest 15 states by GDP spent on average over 220%
          of their tax receipts. Clearly, states have been spending at unsustainable levels without facing immediate
          consequences due to federal transfer payments and other temporary factors."
