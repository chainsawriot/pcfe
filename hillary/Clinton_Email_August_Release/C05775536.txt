HANOI (AP) - A Southeast Asian official said the leaders of Japan and China have held an informal meeting at
a regional summit amid a diplomatic row that has overshadowed the gathering. Surin Pitsuwan, secretary-
general of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, confirmed that Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and
Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan met Saturday on the sidelines of the summit of East Asian leaders in Hanoi,
Vietnam. There had been speculation they would not meet at all because of a dispute over a maritime territorial
dispute that plunged relations to a five-year low.
