Subject: 10 AmCits arrested with 33 children, headed to DR. Now under arrest in Port au Prince

I am seeking more information about this but want to let you know before the 5pm call that 10 Amcits were reportedly
arrested by Haitian police near the DR border with 33 Haitian children whom they reportedly planned to take to an
orphanage they are establishing in the DR. They are currently under arrest at a PAP police station or, according to one
report, at "the Justice Building near the airport." The whereabouts of the children is unknown.

The group is called the New Life Children Refuge America Organization (NLCR). Bill Bistransky found the attached "Plan
of Action"(P0A) on their web site when he googled that name. As he notes, either today's arrest is their second run
into Haiti to get children, or their original schedule is off.

        Subject: 10 AmCits arrested with 33 orphans

        Consular Affairs was notified by the Embassy duty officer in Santo Domingo of the arrest of 10 Amcits from
        Idaho by Haitian police. They were attempting to take 33 'orphans' to Santo Domingo for the stated purpose of
        establishing an orphanage to care for the children. The Americans are in the custody of the Haitian police. We
        have no information about the whereabouts of the 33 orphans.
