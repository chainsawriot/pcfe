Subject:                           Thank you!


You were so terrific at the UN. The statements of gratitude are pouring in. I will take your message to Denmark. The
Nordics will be ecstatic.

Last night at Avon, I got many messages for you from people who want to be helpful, particularly from Anna Quinlan and
Patrick Dempsey. I'm hoping to get more $ from Avon to fund VAW grants. We are inundated with requests. Reese
Witherspoon will go to Russia next year for our women's summit. She's popular there so would be good. Nothing much
has happened vis a vis Russian women and US engagement since your efforts in the 90's so we are attempting to restart
are relationship with them .They been going backwards in terms of progress.

I'm attaching the email I sent Jake and Kurt on the NZ and Australian initiatives.

Have a good trip.

I just wanted to give you some background on the initiatives that New Zealand and Australia have put together to
empower women in the Pacific region and which they would like to spotlight during the Secretary's trip.

NZ wants to announce a collaboration between us and their government to increase women's political participation in
the Pacific region. Their development agency has made this a priority for the Secretary's trip. Our hope is that S will
welcome the collaboration in her remarks at a business leaders, et al reception.
Australia wants to announce a collaboration with us on an initiative to combat violence against women in the region. I
don't know where this will be included in S's remarks, but I hope it will. Both governments are committing significant
resources; we are committing much less, but Australia and NZ are eager to partner with us to address challenges in the
Pacific region.

I wanted to briefly share some thoughts on this formed during my last trip to China. It made the collaboration with NZ
and Australia on deeper engagement with the Pacific Islands on women and development issues that much more
compelling.

I was in Shanghai and Beijing last month to speak at the All-China Women's Federation (ACWF) international women's
forum to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Beijing women conference and to follow up on our interest to launch
with the Chinese government the US-China Women Leaders Forum.

The ACWF is a mass organization affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party with strong leaders, huge resources and
powerful mobilizing forces throughout the country. The Chair, Chen Zhili, is also the Deputy Chair of the National
People's Congress, a former State Councilor; the President, Song Xiuyan, is a former governor of Qinghai Province and
rumored to be appointed as a State Councilor after the change of central leadership in 2012. I met with both of them
when I was there.

As I walked into the welcoming dinner in Shanghai, I found almost everyone I know of significance who works on
women's issues from Southeast Asia, the Pacific and Africa in attendance. However, I did not see government reps from
Europe or NEAsia. It appeared to me that the forum was targeted to engage countries and regions where China is
expanding its influence.

I know S is going to give a policy speech in Australia during this trip. I hope that you will include our commitment to
women in the Pacific Islands, especially through these proposed collaborations with Australia and NZ.

As you know very well, the 12 Pacific Islands, though small in size, represent 12 votes in the UN. They long for our
attention and collaboration. I think women's development issues are one ideal way to further our interests and
engagement.

Have a good trip!
Melanne
