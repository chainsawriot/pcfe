> Aug. 11 (Bloomberg) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the U.S. Senate must vote to ratify a treaty with Russia to
cut nuclear weapons when lawmakers return in September from their monthlong recess.

> "Our national security is at risk," Clinton said in a statement to reporters at the State Department in Washington. "It's
been more than eight months since we've had inspectors on the ground in Russia" who give "a vital window into
Russia's arsenal."

> The agreement, which is a priority for President Barack Obama, would replace the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or
START, that expired in December and left the former Cold War rivals with no way to verify each other's nuclear
weapons.

> Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, delayed a vote by the panel to
round up more bipartisan support. The extra time may help get more Republicans on board, he said. Democrats control
the Senate 59-41, with 67 votes, or two-thirds, needed for ratification.

> "When the Senate returns they must act," Clinton said today. The treaty "will advance our national security and
provide stability and predictability between the world's two leading nuclear powers," she said.


> Democrats, including Kerry, say the U.S. will need to set an example of arms cuts as Obama and other top officials
press their counterparts to impose more of their own sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program to complement United
Nations penalties adopted earlier this year.


> Republicans including Arizona Senator Jon Kyl have balked at a treaty they say could hamstring U.S. plans for a
European missile defense system that Russia opposes.
