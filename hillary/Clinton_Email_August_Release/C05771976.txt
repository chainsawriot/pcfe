Subject:                           Krishna call



The Indian foreign ministry has been pinging us to have a call between you and Krishna on the nuclear liability
legislation. Bill believes you should call Krishna today — because he will be in receive mode —
            SCA is drafting that message with Bill's guidance. You could then call Menon tomorrow or Wednesday.


If you agree, we'll get the call sheet out to you soon.
