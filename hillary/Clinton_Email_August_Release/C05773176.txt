JERUSALEM (AP) - Diplomatic sources said the United States offered Israel an incentive package to reinstate
a moratorium on West Bank settlement building in an effort to revive stalled peace talks with the
Palestinians. Under the deal, Israel would stop settlement construction for 90 days in the West Bank, but not in
east Jerusalem. Among the incentives, the United States would fight resolutions critical of Israel at the United
Nations.
