Subject: Pis dear: Statement on Iraqi Government Coalition Agreement

                            STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON

                                Iraqi Government Coalition Agreement

I applaud [rag's political leaders for working together to agree on an inclusive government that
represents the will of the Iraqi people and moves their country forward. Today's coalition
decision is a milestone in the emergence of the new Iraq and it is a testament to the
determination of the Iraqi people to build their own democracy, a goal only they can achieve.

This agreement ensures meaningful representation for the election winners, encompassing all of
Iraq's ethnic and sectarian communities. It also includes critical provisions for power-sharing
and other reforms, including revisions to the to the de-Ba'athification process. In addition, Iraqi
leaders have agreed to establish a National Council of Strategic Policies. This important body
will serve as a steering group in the areas of defense policy, foreign affairs, economic policy,
and other strategic issues.

As Iraqis continue their progress, they will have a committed and consistent partner in the
United States. Our relationship is rooted in mutual respect and mutual interest. We look
forward to expanding our cooperation under the Strategic Framework Agreement and together
pursuing our shared goal of building a long-term, multidimensional relationship between our
two nations that contributes to growing peace and prosperity in Iraq and security and stability in
the Middle East.
