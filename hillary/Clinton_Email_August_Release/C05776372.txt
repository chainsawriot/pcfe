CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt's opposition Muslim Brotherhood, which held a fifth of seats in the outgoing parliament, has
pulled out of an election race after winning no seats in the first round, al-Arabiya television reported.

   The group, which runs candidates as independents to skirt a ban on religious parties, said the vote was rigged in favor
of President Mubarak's ruling party.

  Al-Arabiya said the group was pulling out of a run-off to be held on December 5. The group said 26 of its candidates
had made it through to the run-off. A senior Brotherhood official told Reuters an announcement would be made later
on December 1.
