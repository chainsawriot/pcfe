Dear Cheryl,

Thank you for the update on the ongoing matter of thelDB and the hopeful reelection of Luis Alberto Moreno. I am
pleased that you and Luis had a good opportunity to meet and discuss the current situation. Following up with Mexico
strikes me as exactly the right next step. Assuming Luis' outreach to Mexico goes well I would hope and think we would
be very close to resolving the situation in a positive manner. I look forward to our staying in touch in that regard.

Thank you and Secretary Clinton for your consistent engagement and usual good judgment on this important matter.

Personally,
Mack

Luis and I met today and had a good conversation.

He is following up with Mexico, whom he also believes will be expressing their support, which will be impactful to
putting this issue to rest.

Best.

Dear Cheryl,

Good morning as another full week begins for both of us, but particularly for you and the distinguished Secretary.
Hillary's interview on Meet the Press was flawless as was the cover story in Newsweek. Her great pictures are matching
her thoughtful words.

Cheryl it is my understanding that
President of the IDB. Assuming this information is accurate (and I believe it is) I think this puts the US in a difficult and
awkward position not to be agreeable to Luis' continued leadership at the IDB. We are simply unnecessarily complicating
a relationship and situation in the hemisphere in my humble opinion.

I wanted to be certain you were aware of this development and would appreciate any thoughts or guidance you have as
to how we might bring this matter to a timely and positive conclusion.

Personally,                                                                                                                1.4(B)
