I hope that you can read this (3 pages) before your meeting with Secretary Gates on pooled funding on Monday. I have
spent a lot of time thinking about these issues in the context of the QDDR, but I think if we're going to push the position I
suggest, it has to be now. If you agree, there are a number of ways we can make this quite attractive to other agencies as
well as DoD. AM
