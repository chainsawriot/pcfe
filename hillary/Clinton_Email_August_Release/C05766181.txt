With the annual Pentagon budget bill due on the House floor this week, a familiar face may be missing.Rep. John
Murtha, chairman of the House Appropriations defense panel, was hospitalized Sunday night because of abdominal
pains. The 77-year-old Pennsylvania Democrat had been feeling ill with what he thought last week was swine flu but the
hospitalization appears related to his gall bladder."He's currently resting and doing well," his office said. But a major
committee hearing Murtha had planned for Tuesday on the growing U.S. military commitment in Afghanistan has been
postponed
