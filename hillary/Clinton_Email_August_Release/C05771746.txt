SEOUL (Reuters) — North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and his son and successor Jong-un visited the artillery base from
where shells were fired at a South Korean island just hours before the attack, South Korean media reported on
November 25. North Korea's attack on Yeonpyeong Island that killed two South Korean marines and two civilians
November 22 was probably ordered by Kim Jong-il himself, the Joongang Daily quoted a well-informed government
source as saying. Seoul government officials contacted by Reuters could not comment on the reports. South Korean
media reported the father and son had met General Kim Kyok-sik, the commander of the frontline fourth corps in charge
of a Navy base in South Hwanghae province, just before the North shelled the island. JoongAng Daily quoted a source as
saying that Kim visited the coastal artillery base in Gaemori from where the shells were fired with his son a day before
the attack.
