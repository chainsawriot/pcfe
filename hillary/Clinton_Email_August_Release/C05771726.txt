I am hoping you are talking about a Pledge for Palestine, but as I noted a while ago, I had also been thinking about how
he and Gates could globalize their overall Pledge campaign in a way that could help change the attitude/culture of elites
in countries like Pakistan toward greater social responsibility (starting with paying taxes). We haven't gotten that idea
fleshed out yet, but it would be worth at least raising for later follow-up.
