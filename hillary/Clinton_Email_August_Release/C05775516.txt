Thx for all your help especially since I know it's hard helping Methodists!

Really good stuff. Especially fantastic opening page

Getting very very good feedback

I can't even remember now what if anything in it bugged me yesterday. Nothing in it has anyone making a double take
to flesh out so far.

Its overall frame of the partnership paints you in exactly the way I think people respect you most, and I think Hirsh might
actually have come up with a theme that will stick.

Have only seen the cover photo online, I want to see the hardcopy since we all know it's the pictures that really matter.
Text on the cover is great
