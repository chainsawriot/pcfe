Subject: Morning meeting notes

Cheryl,


Below are the notes I took at this morning's senior staff meeting. As you can see, it was a little perfunctory with the A-
team mostly out of the building. I believe Harold sought out the Secretary on this topic at midday...have a nice
weekend...km



Summary of 8:45 meeting, May 7, 2010:

(M) Pat Kennedy chaired, with (L) Harold Koh, (PA) Pi Crowley, (S/P) Ann-Marie Slaughter, (H) Matthew Rooney, (D)
Sheba Crocker, (D) Piper Campbell, (P) Alice Wells, and (S/ES)Kin Moy attending.
