PARIS (AP) The U.S. Embassy in Paris says two of its employees are undergoing medical tests after handling a suspicious
letter. Embassy spokesman Paul Patin says employees in the mailroom identified a "suspicious letter" and French
authorities were summoned to examine it. He says "we have no indication that anyone is in danger or hurt" but that the
two employees who handled the letter are being examined by medical authorities. A Paris police official says the two
were feeling "unwell" and that the incident is being investigated.
