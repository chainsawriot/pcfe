           A question from your friends at the Senate Democratic Communications Center: If
           you were making a major foreign policy decision affecting massive arsenals of
           nuclear weapons, would you tend to lean towards the position supported by:

 In supporting ratification of the New START Treaty, Democrats are siding with
 the cross-party consensus view of virtually the entire foreign policy establishment
 — including former President George H.W. Bush, Secretary of Defense Gates,
 Secretary of State Clinton, and the secretaries of state from the last five presidents.
 In opposing ratification, many Senate Republicans are siding with the position
 supported by... Sarah Palin.



 The individuals in the first group have over a century of foreign policy
 experience between them, and have worked closely on U.S.-Russia relations
 for decades. On the other hand, Palin can see Russia from her house.
 Apparently, that's good enough for many Senate Republicans.
