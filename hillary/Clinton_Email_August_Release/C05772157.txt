Subject: McCain's START amendment defeated 59-37 (U)

(U) Media report members of the Senate voted December 18 to defeat an amendment proposed by Senator McCain (R-
AZ). The amendment called for language that recognizes a relationship between offensive and defensive weapons to be
taken out of the START treaty's preamble. If passed, the amendment would have sent the treaty back to U.S. and
Russian negotiators.
