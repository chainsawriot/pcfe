Good public movement on START by Judd Gregg.

G.O.P. Support for Arms Treaty

By

PETER BAKER

Another Republican senator signaled Tuesday that he may vote for the new arms control treaty with Russia if it comes
up for a vote before the Senate adjourns for the year later this month.

Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, who did not run for re-election, said he hopes that the Senate will get a chance
to vote on the treaty, known as New Start, right after a deal on tax cuts and a spending resolution to keep the
government operating.

"Start is an important issue. It should be fully debated. I am leaning towards supporting it," he told Andrea Mitchell on
MSNBC. "I haven't made a final decision," he added, noting that Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the lead Republican
negotiator on the treaty, still has concerns. "He has some reservations, but I believe many of those reservations are
being addressed," Mr. Gregg said.

President Obama has made passing the treaty his top foreign policy priority for the lame-duck session. Under the
Constitution, approving a treaty requires a two-thirds super-majority, or 67 votes, meaning that Mr. Obama needs nine
Republicans assuming all 58 Democrats stick with him.

At this point, more than that many Republicans have offered positive-sounding statements like that made on Tuesday
