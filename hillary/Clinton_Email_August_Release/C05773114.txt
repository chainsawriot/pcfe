Subject: (AP) Indian report: Pakistan spies tied to Mumbai siege

NEW DELHI (AP) - A U.S. citizen convicted of scouting locations for the 2008 Mumbai attack said Pakistan's spy agency
was deeply involved in the planning of the assault.
  David Headley told Indian interrogators that officers from Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency gave him
$25,000 to fund his scouting missions to Mumbai ahead of the attack.
  He said he debriefed his ISI handler every time he returned to Pakistan from Mumbai. He said his handler also made
suggestions about how best to carry out the attack.
  The revelations were contained in the Indian government's report on its June interrogation of Headley. The report,
marked secret, was obtained by The Associated Press.
  The Mumbai attacks killed 166 people.
