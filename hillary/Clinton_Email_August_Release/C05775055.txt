Hillary and Cheryl,

I'm feeling very good about our recent efforts to connect our speeches thematically. We've done it with development,
human rights, and Internet freedom; and most recently with AIPAC, Ctr for Middle East Peace, and next the AJC. Here's
what I want to suggest: The three most basic elements of human existence are food, water, and health. We have now
done major speeches on food and water. I'd like us to consider a major speech on global health â€” the third in a trilogy.
Linking these three issues thematically, we can explain how and why foreign policy challenges and solutions must be
seen through a prism of human survival and why the conditions of people's lives influence everything from economic
development to political stability and more..This trilogy of speeches (with the right PR) could further underscore our
elevation of development AND our comprehensive, smart power approach to foreign policy. After all, food, water, and
health are the sine qua non of human progress. And this is a Hillary Clinton signature idea, at least to me. Thoughts?

LM
