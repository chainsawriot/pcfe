Jake —

Here is an update for the Secretary on the status of the non-finance components of the G-20 Seoul Summit
declaration. Sherpa, Finance Deputy, and Working Group discussions are ongoing on the financial issues (and
the text is very close hold) — so we don't have much on that. The following represents what is likely to be close
to the final outcome on the other issues.


      •     Fossil Fuel Subsidies: The text will reaffirm the Pittsburgh Summit commitment to phase out over the
            medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. It will also take up the issue of fuel price volatility; this
            portion will focus on improving the quality of fuel data (inventories, storage capacity, refining, etc.) and
            greater dialogue between fuel producers and consumers.

      •     Climate Change: The G-20 will rededicate their efforts to discuss climate change issues under the
            UNFCCC process with the aim of reaching a global and comprehensive framework post 2012. The text
            will also focus on the upcoming COP16 conference in Mexico.

      •     Trade: The G-20 will continue to collectively push for the conclusion of the Doha Round, calling for
            intensified engagement in 2011.

      •     Development: The Communiqué will contain a multi-year development action plan that focuses on nine
            pillars: infrastructure, human resource development, trade, private investment and job creation, food
            security, financial inclusion, fiscal integrity and domestic resource mobilization, and "growth with
            resilience."

      •     Anti-Corruption: The G-20 will endorse an Anti-Corruption Action Plan to spur action under the UN
            Convention Against Corruption; address transnational bribery; deny corrupt persons access to the global
            financial system; and further engage the private sector.


I will be happy to provide more details on any one of these items if the Secretary would like — and will report
on the discussions and final outcome.

I am headed to China tomorrow to discuss several issues including rare earth metals, intellectual property
protection, internet freedom and indigenous innovation. Then to the APEC foreign ministers meeting with Jim
— followed by the G-20 Summit and the APEC Summit.

Regards,
Bob
