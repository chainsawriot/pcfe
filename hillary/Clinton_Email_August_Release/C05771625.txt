ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan will only re-open a supply route for coalition troops in Afghanistan once public anger
over NATO incursions eases and security improves, the foreign ministry spokesman said October 3.

   Militants threatened more attacks on tankers carrying fuel to Afghanistan through routes in Pakistan to avenge the
incursions.

  "Unless the reaction cools down and we make sure that the supply line is secured, we cannot reopen it," Foreign
Ministry spokesman Abdul Basit told Reuters.

   Angered by repeated incursions by NATO helicopters over the past week, Pakistan blocked a supply route for NATO
troops in Afghanistan after one such strike killed three Pakistani soldiers on September 30 in the northwestern Kurram
region.
