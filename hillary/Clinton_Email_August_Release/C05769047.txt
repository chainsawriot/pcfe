                                                                      RELEASE IN FULL




         Cuba has publicly expressed its willingness to cooperate, without

         any exception, with all countries that are offering assistance to the

         Haitian people in the midst of the tragedy facing them.



         We wish to know what kind of cooperation would be that which is

         being suggested by the US authorities.



         At this moment we have more than 400 health cooperation workers

         in Haiti. This medical staff is made up by specialists in General

         Comprehensive Medicine (MGI), surgeons, orthopedic doctors,

         intensivists, anesthesiologists, pediatricians, clinicians, radiologists,

         nurses, and other health technicians. They are currently working in

         all ten Departments of the country. The number of health specialists

         will increase as new medical assistance centers are open.



         Added to these, hundreds of Haitian doctors graduated in Cuba,

         residents and fifth-year medicine students who are being mobilized

         both in Haiti and in Cuba will immediately join the staff that is

         assisting the emergency cases and the population in general.



         More than two hundred health cooperation workers are offering their

         services in four centers of Port-au-Prince: Peace Hospital (Delmas

         33); Renaissance Hospital, Ofatma Hospital, Leoganne Hospital.

         We have also an Itinerant Primary Health Care Brigade that is

         assisting the crowds gathered in the down-town area who have not

         been able to get to the medical assistance posts, as well as in some

         outskirts villages such as Arcahaie, Lagonave Island, Carrefour and

         Petit Goave, including other regions such as Les Cayes and Nippes.



         Besides, emergency services are also offered in five

         Comprehensive Diagnostics Centers -hospitals equipped with

         adequate technology- located in Mirebalais, Aquin, Grand Goave,

         Anse-a-Veu and Raboteau.



         At this moment, medical doctors and paramedics from Venezuela,

         Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Spain and Canada, as well as members of

         the religious orders "Daughters of Charity" and "Missionaries of the

         Risen Christ" are working together with the Cuban medical staff.



         We are also cooperating with Namibia and Norway to convey

         assistance to Haiti.



         Members of MINUSTAH have been taking care of security at the

          Peace Hospital (Delmas 33), and the Pan-American Health

         Organization (PAHO) has supplied our Medical Brigade with a

         number of medicines.



         Our aid operations are being coordinated on the ground directly by

         our Ambassador to Haiti and the Head of the Cuban Medical

         Brigade.



         Until January 18, the Cuban doctors had assisted 11 123 patients

         and performed 877 surgeries.



         We need to know the location of the US hospitals or medical

         assistance centers installed in Port-au-Prince as well as their

         characteristics.



         Cuba is concerned about the high number of persons affected who

         will require rehabilitation later on, and believes that this is one of the

         important aspects that need to be considered.



         In the midst of the most tragic circumstances, there is a very

         dynamic process going on in Haiti. Cuba is trying to respond with

         utmost urgency to the additional needs and problems that are

         emerging. Any inaccuracy or change in data, which may result from

         the need to urgently respond to the situation created, will be rectified

         and notified.
