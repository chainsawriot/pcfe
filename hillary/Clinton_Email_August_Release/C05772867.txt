Subject:                           Welcome back!



Your trip looked very prodcutive from here and thanks for embracing the women's initiatives in AU and NZ. Their
governments were thrilled and the press was excellent. Lots of good work ahead.




                                    The video for the women presidents was gratefully received. I sat with Lithuania,
Slovakia and Liberia at dinner and they all mentioned it.

You were lucky to miss election day.
