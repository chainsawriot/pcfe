FYI we are putting out the following statement.

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON

Bombing of the Shrine of Syed Ali Hujviri in Lahore

I was shocked and saddened by yesterday's attack on one of Pakistan's most popular places of worship, the Shrine of
Syed Ali Hujviri (Data Ganjbakhsh) in Lahore, which claimed the lives of many innocent Pakistanis.

The extremists have shown that they respect neither human dignity nor the fundamental religious values of Pakistani
society. Violating the sanctity of this revered shrine is a particularly sinister attempt to destabilize Pakistan and to
intimidate its people. The attackers will not succeed, as the Pakistani public refuses to be cowed by such violence.

We condemn this brutal crime and reaffirm our commitment to support the Pakistani people in their efforts to defend
their democracy from the violent extremists who seek to destroy it. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of
the victims and with all the people of Pakistan.
