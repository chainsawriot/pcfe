BELFAST (Reuters) - A car bomb planted outside a Northern Ireland police station by dissident republicans was defused,
police said, a day after a bomb exploded near the headquarters of the British intelligence services. In a call to local
media, the Continuity IRA, which last year killed a police officer in the bloodiest three days in Northern Ireland for more
than a decade, claimed responsibility for planting the bomb in the county of Armagh.
