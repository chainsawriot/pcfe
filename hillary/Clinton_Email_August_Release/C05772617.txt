Subject: Your speech on the Mideast

Madame Secretary,

On Wednesday, you're scheduled to give a 15-minute talk at a gala hosted by the American Task Force on Palestine, a
moderate, pro-peace Palestinian-American organization. Here's a quick overview of our plans for the speech, which we
developed with NEA. Please let us know if you have any reactions.




The audience in the room will include Palestinian-Americans who are influential in their communities: lawyers, doctors,
business leaders, etc. Of course, a much larger audience beyond the room will read this speech as well. This is your first
opportunity to address this issue in a serious way since the end of the moratorium.




Key points:
