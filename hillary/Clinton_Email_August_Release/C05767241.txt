Cheryl,

I'm sure we'll never know all that you and Secretary Clinton (and probably President Clinton too) did behind the scenes to secure the
release of Jim Allen and seven other Americans who were detained in Haiti for 20 days, but we wanted to thank you nevertheless. We
appreciated the promptness with which you assigned a first rate liaison to communicate with us - Ted Coley - and we appreciate the
accomodations State made in the form of information delivery to Jim and assistance with his return to the United States. Jim is resting
in Fort Lauderdale now and will return to Amarillo by private plane later in the morning. His wife Lisa is with him in Fort
Lauderdale. The country is fortunate to have first rate diplomats and crisis responders like you in positions of public responsibility,
and we appreciated your willingness to look carefully at the facts, including the distinctions between the roles played by each of the
Americans who went to Haiti as volunteers.

Again, thank you on our behalf, and on behalf of the Allen family, and best wishes with continuing relief and recovery efforts.

Reg Brown
