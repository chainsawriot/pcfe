Interesting re; Iran. Coco counsels that Maziar Bahari thinks          s a bit emotional - but admits that for those of us    B6
confined to English we take what we can get.

Quite an interesting reply to my fanmail to           the blogger I've been copying to you.

Hello Coco,Thank you for your kind words and sorry for the late reply -- I've been busy with the holiday season (also why
there's been a drop-off in posts Iately),I wouldn't place an extra emphasis on Haji's arrest (or on anyone at Baran, for
that matter). I think those arrests were geared at intimidating Khatami more than anything. Although he's been more
quiet than either Mousavi or Karoubi, he has "international clout," if you will, so I believe the regime is less willing to
attack him head-on. (Though what we witnessed on Tasooa was admittedly shocking). Actually, with a few exceptions, I
think a threshold has been passed where arrests aren't even strategic anymore. It seems that the vast majority are for
the sake of intimidation. The regime is looking increasingly desperate.Rafsanjani, I'm sure, is up to something. He's a
good ally, but I think the pro-democracy movement should always be wary of his intentions. Ultimately, Rafsanjani is
looking out for Rafsanjani. Having said that, I think his interests and those of the Greens have and will continue to
coalesce. Before the election, this was him funding Mousavi's campaign (in hopes that Mousavi's presidency would bring
him back into the fold after the rise of the "new right"). Now (and going forward), he's probably more concerned about
his legacy in Iran. We should remember he was the driving force that ascended Khamenei to the Supreme Leadership,
and that there were also accusations that the 2005 election (where he lost to Ahmadinejad) was fixed. Not to simplify
things, but I'm sure there is some resentment. Regardless, sooner or later he's going to have to be more bold and give
the opposition something (namely momentum, as he did with his July sermon) if he wants to get something back (clout,
legacy, etc.).Things are continuing to heat up! God-willing, change will come in 2010. Whether such a change is
ultimately 'regime change' should be up to the Iranian people inside Iran.Best              Sent using BlackBerryÂ® from

I've always wanted to go to Qom, and Iran too admittedly, as you know, more for the far history than recent I confess. I
can't sort out whether I want to go more or less now though because of recent turmoil/promise/discontent; maybe
want and sense are merely opposing forces! If only I could find an approproate Jane Austen quote...
I'm still very sad we missed your 30th and will miss your official fund launch. Hopefully we can celebrate with you soon,
soon. Coming back to fundraise in NY anytime soon?

A bit of arcana = but important.



http://www.payvand.com/news/10/jan/1008.html



The Society of Qom Seminary Teachers has disqualified Ayatollah Sanei as a Marja-e Taqhlid (source of emulation - high
clerical rank). Ayatollah Sanei, second to Montazeri, was the most outspoken critic of the election and subsequent
repression in Qom - he's also a very popular cleric in Iran and many of Montazeri's supporters were shifting to him. Iran
suppresses any figures about the support these clerics have, but we're talking millions.



The Society's power to disqualify Sanei is pretty questionable and it's a provocative act - all you need in Shiism to
become a Marja-e Taghlid is the faith of followers and confirmation of "two fair and knowledgeable individuals" and this
move is the latest in a decade long move by Khamenei to shift the clergy's power and authority away from their
constituency of followers and towards the government (increasing the clergy's dependence on the state for funds has
been the primary tool of reform.) Since Ashura the silence from Qom has been notable and this disqualification will split
the clergy further into those who side with the government and those who bet on popular support for their long term
influence. This last group are increasingly being forced to show their hand and incur punishment/risk assassination of
themselves or family members (cf Mousavi's nephew.)



Predictably, harder line clerics like Ayatollah Hussein Nouri Hamedani and former Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Mohammad
Yazdi have sided with Khamenei and the Rev Guard, as has Larijani (a key move by a smart betting man), but the
majority remain on the fence - and the next few weeks that include the mourning rituals for Ayatollah Montazeri, the
Ashura Martyrs, Arbein (40 days after Ashura) and the Anniversary of the Revolution on 2nd February will be events to
watch. Each of them are mass public rituals that have underpinned the Islamic Revolution for 30 years, and canceling
them would indicate extraordinary weakness by the government. They are obvious opportunities for the Green
Movement to mobilize, risk death and continue the cycle; the government knows it doesn't have the training or self
control to contain them peacefully and must be scratching their heads over how to stop this cycle. Forcing Revolutionary
Guard officers to shoot civilians is also a very risky move.



The ultimate fence sitter, and key figure behind Mousavi and Karroubi is of course Rafsanjani - who came out in veiled
support of the government, and it's supporters on Saturday, 2nd Jan. This support either cost Khamenei something, or
the Revolutionary Guard and he found leverage with the Shark. All a bit murky. Rafsanjani's clearly hedging his bets and
may feel that he would do best out of a negotiated National Unity Plan.

(NB          's pretty emotional - and clearly skewed, but useful info). http://www.thenewestdeal.org/2009/10/national-
unity-plan.html

I still think the Western Press is optimistic about Khamenei and the Revolutionary Guard's weakness - but moves like
that against Montazeri and Sanei, and inflation running unofficially at 25% (confirmed by furious down town Tehran
friends quoting tomato prices) may finally push a broader tranche of society to join what has been a middle class protest
until now. The big problem with the 'protest' is that it doesn't have a credible leader, or stated ideals, but it's certainly
terrified those in power.

Predictions are for nutters in this situation, but I would doubt that Khamenei has the stomach for civil war, and there
must be some deals cooking. It's a tricky one for the West over who to support - because no deal will be clean.

To be continued...

All love,

Coco
