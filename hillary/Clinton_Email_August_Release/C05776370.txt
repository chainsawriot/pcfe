"Sarah Palin's brand of politics, for example, defining some Americans as being from "real America" and others as
wherever it is she thinks they are from (a city, perhaps?) is bad for America. Such political warmongering implodes our
core values...

Our first calling, in politics, is to protect, honor and leave better our American system...

If we tear down the American political process by doing and saying anything to win then we have failed that calling
before we ever begin...

The campaign cycle of 2010 has had a tumultuous start. Tea Party libertarians screaming from street corners, unhappy
workers taking on incumbents, disgruntled faithful praying that the administration will keep its promises, Birthers
repelling from black helicopters into the American mainstream and town hall meetings resembling Three Stooges re-
runs have been forever social networked into our national psyche. Something is askew!"

THE RULES FOR 2010... http://www.huffingtonpost.com/burns-strider/big-daddys-rules-for-the_b_609004.html
