SUbject: Human Rights report on Haiti

Cheryl,
     Local media drew attention this weekend to the line in the introduction of our annual human rights report that
refers to the GOH by saying that there is severe corruption in all branches of government,              called this morning
asking for a copy of the report (which we sent him), saying that the President was upset and wanted to read it. The
Embassy human rights officer sent the Department a first draft of this report late last year. It normally would have gone
through two or three more versions with input from DRL and ultimately clearance by the Embassy Front Office. Because
our Human Rights officer (Kathey-Lee Galvin) was seriously injured in the quake, DRL took it upon themselves to finish
the report. The final draft was never sent to us for clearance/comments and I don't know who all in the Department
cleared off on it. You may already be familiar with the report, but in the event you are not, I wanted you to have a copy
in advance of meetings in Santo Domingo where you may hear about it from                             Cheers, David
