House Democrats Plan Schedule
for Lame-Duck Session
By Alan K Ota, CQ Staff
House Democratic leaders on Wednesday outlined a schedule for the
lame-duck session that would have lawmakers in town for at least two
weeks in November and into early December.
Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., assistant to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, said in an
interview after a conference call among Democratic leaders that
lawmakers were likely to work through next week, take a week off for the
Thanksgiving recess, and return for a second — and, for now, final —
week from Nov. 29 to Dec. 3.
Van Hollen, who is poised to take over next year as the top Democrat on
the Budget Committee, said he was unsure how Democrats would resolve
disputes over unfinished business such as tax cuts that are set to expire
Dec. 31 and funding for federal programs beyond the stopgap spending
measure (PL 111-242) that expires Dec. 3.
"We simply identified some of the issues that are out there," Van Hollen
said of the private leadership chat. "Obviously, the big issue is how we
deal with various tax issues. And then there's the issue of an omnibus
[spending bill] versus a continuing resolution. There are a lot of other
potential issues. We're going to try to get the nutrition bill."

He was referring to ongoing talks over a possible extension of expiring
provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts (PL 107-16, PL 108-27), the
debate over whether to move an omnibus spending bill for fiscal 2011 or
another temporary spending measure, and a stalled child nutrition bill (HR
5504).
Van Hollen said that Pelosi, D-Calif., did not bring up the issue of the
tough caucus race for minority whip — the second-ranking Democrat in
the next Congress — between Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland and James E.
Clyburn of South Carolina. Both men were on the telephone call, Van
Hollen said, but the issue did not come up.
Democratic aides said Pelosi has encouraged both men to reach a
settlement to avert the potentially bloody intraparty fight. "That wasn't
part of the discussion," Van Hollen said.
