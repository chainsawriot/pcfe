U.S. Orders Diplomats to Sto Telling Truth

Fake news by Andy Borovvibe;
WASHINGTONâ€”In the first major policy fallout from the WikiLeaks disclosures, the State Department has ordered all
U.S. diplomats to "cease and desist telling the truth until further notice."
"We are working overtime to fly to make sure that leaks like these don't happen again," Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
told reporters. "But until we've got the leaks plugged, it's incumbent on all our diplomats to put on their lying caps."
Clinton noted that since many U.S. diplomats are major political donors with long careers in the business world, "this
shouldn't be a reach for them." But for those career diplomats who came up through the Foreign Service, the State
Department will be holding a series of "truth avoidance seminars," led by executives of Goldman Sachs.
Additionally, Clinton said, the State Department would install on all diplomats' computers new software called
CandorShield', which automatically translates truthful language into a less embarrassing truth-free version. For
example, she explained, the software would translate the phrase "two-faced weasels" into "trusted Pakistani allies" and
would delete all references to French President Nicolas Sarkozy as "Monsieur Shorty Pants."
Elsewhere, Interpol issued this statement about its pursuit of WikiLea.ks founder Julian Assange: "We will find Julian
Assange, and then we will hire him."
