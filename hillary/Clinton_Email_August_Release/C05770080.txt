Subject: (AP) Obama will resume talks on South Korea trade

TORONTO - A senior administration official says President Obama has decided to resume talks aimed at resolving issues
blocking the completion of a free trade agreement with South Korea. The official says Obama plans to announce the
new effort after a meeting with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak. The official says the goal would be to clear up
remaining differences with Seoul by the time Obama visits South Korea in November. The official spoke on condition of
anonymity because Obama had not yet spoken.
