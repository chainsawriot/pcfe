DUBLIN (Reuters) â€” Ireland's four-year plan to reduce its deficit will be published on November 23, ahead of any
international financial aid package, the Irish Times reported, citing unnamed senior Irish officials. "The cabinet will meet
November 21 to sign off on the 160-page document which charts how the state will reduce its outgoings," the Irish Times
said, adding the publication date had been brought forward so it could be identified as a government-originated plan
rather than one driven by Europe or the IMF. The Irish Times said a separate plan for restructuring the banking sector
was also expected to be finalized November 20-21.
