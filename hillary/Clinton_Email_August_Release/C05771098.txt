Subject:                           Most importantly....



I enjoyed our talk too, but forgot to mention the most important thing of all -- how much I appreciate your bringing me
to State and giving me this opportunity. I have learned so much, meant so many smart and capable people, and hope I
have contributed in some small way to what you are working so hard to accomplish.

I'll write a formal letter for "the file" when I leave conveying all of these thoughtsâ€ž but I wanted to say something in
person too.
Unfortunately, I got carried away on sports diplomacy and everything else and ....another senior moment!

I'll let you know when I have had a chance to talk to Judith and Ann about the ideas I'm putting together on sports. I do
think there is potential to do much more than is being done now -- and more creatively.
