Thanks. Need to be sure this gets picked up by print and/or broadcast outlets as well as some major online enterprise in
ALL critical languages (URDU, PASHTO. Etc) so that it pops up when this topic is googled. Have Richard send me his plan
for getting this picked up. Do you have a copy of the release in Urdu that I can forward to WH and Hill ?

Subject: Mission Corrections: Bhutto Assassination




Under Secretary McHale:




This week we have seen the most extraordinary series of public attacks on the United States by Lt Gen (ret) Hamid Gul, a
noted anti-American crackpot who derives his role as an "expert analyst" by being the only former Inter-Services
Intelligence (ISI) Chief who ever appears on TV. Gul was briefly 151 chief during PM Bhutto's first term in office almost 20
years ago. Appearing on several TV stations this week, Gul has repeated allegations that the U.S. is implicated in the
Bhutto Assassination â€” the subject is current this week because of the release of the U.N. report on the assassination,
which is itself a remarkable document.




One ironic element of the UN report on the assassination is the report that on October 16, 2007 former PM Bhutto
wrote to General Musharraf that the very same Hamid Gul was one of three people she considered a threat to her
security. (see excerpt below) This fact came up in none of the programs.




Our view is that the television journalists and executives now must begin taking responsibility for putting inciting and
unsubstantiated claims on the air. We have released the attached "Correction," which will be seen by news editors
across the country.

Excerpt from the UN report on the Bhutto assassination:

179. On 16 October 2007, Ms Bhutto writing from Dubai to General Musharraf, identified three people she considered a
threat to her security: (i) Brigadier (ret) Ejaz Shah, Director General of the IB at the time of the assassination, (ii) General
(ret) Hamid Gul, a former Director General of the 151, and (iii) Mr Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi, Chief Minister of Punjab until
22 November 2007.
