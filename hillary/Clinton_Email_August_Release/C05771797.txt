TEHRAN (Reuters) - Iranian security forces foiled a hijack attempt November 27, arresting a man who said he had
planted a bomb on a flight from Tehran to Damascus, the semi-official Fars news agency reported. The suspect "was
arrested by the security forces inside the plane", Fars said. There was no bomb, and the plane later landed safely in the
Syrian capital, it said. The agency gave no further details and Iranian aviation authorities were not available to
comment.
