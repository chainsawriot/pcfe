MEXICO CITY (AP) - The American tourist who reportedly was shot and killed by Mexican pirates on a border lake may
have been a victim of mistaken identity, a U.S. consulate official said October 14. "I think what you had is two innocent
American tourists who mistakenly stumbled into a bad area and were pursued and the shooting occurred," said Brian
Quigley, spokesman for the U.S. consulate in Matamoros, across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, Texas. Quigley was
responding to a report by Stratfor, an Austin, Texas-based public policy research group that analyzes the Mexican drug
war. The report suggested David and Tiffany Hartley might have been mistaken for drug runners and attacked.
