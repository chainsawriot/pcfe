We were aiming for a draft by the end of the day. Part of the problem is that we have also gotten detailed comments
from jack and raj, as well as v good comments from Jake, that sonni is trying to include. Lissa and I will meet as soon as
we get in and see how fast we can get you something. I know you are heading for well-deserved vacation, but cd you still
find some time to review a final draft this weekend? AM
