Subject: Frank Views: QDDR -- Prevention and Complex Crisis Response

Dear Jack, Anne-Marie and Jim:

Without prejudice to the deliberative process now underway, I owe you my unvarnished and
very frank views on the QDDR process -- and how the U.S. Government must best organize
itself to anticipate and respond effectively to crisis and conflicts. The stakes are huge, and
because we are at the point where the working group I co-chair on this issue has to generate
recommendations, this is the time for me to offer some basic perspectives directly to you --
informed by my experiences working on these issues at the NSC, at State, at the United Nations
and in the NGO community, as well as writing and teaching about them over the course of the
last decade. The QDDR process itself has also impacted my perspectives and, more
importantly, raised serious concerns for me about mistakes we must avoid.

I also realize that current bureaucratic and political realities may impose limitations (or compel
adjustments) to the kinds of organizational arrangements we might make. But the starting point
for me is what makes the most sense.

My propositions:
