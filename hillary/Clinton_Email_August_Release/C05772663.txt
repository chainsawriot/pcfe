Jack--

  In looking at my schedule, I could talk w you by phone Sunday or Monday, rather than meeting, which would give you
back your Monday and service event. I learned the office will be closed Monday, so I will be working from home. Does
that make sense?

 What times would be good to talk tomorrow or Monday?

 Thx, Hillary
