I'm due to leave at 5pm your time to go back to US for various obligations.(Airport may shut at 6) I'm ready to stay
however if you need since I'm anxious about this situation.




If you wished I would stay to try to arrange. But totally understand if not! Best Tony

Tony---

  Message delivered. Pls read all the way down. Also, I'm copying Jake Sullivan because I've asked him to arrange a call w
you once you land so you can be fully briefed before seeing BN. We are on a fast moving train changing direction every
hour but determined to reach our destination.

 Thx again for jumping into action this week. It's great having you on the team. All the best, H

Hillary,
We of course understand and thank you for personally reaching out to us. It is a big loss for the weekend but as we
know it does not add up to a hill of beans. You are the best, and we remain your biggest fans.
Sweet dreams and Godspeed with everything you are doing.

Lynn,

  I was trying to reach you to tell you and Teddy that I asked Tony Blair to go to Israel as part of our full court press on
keeping the Middle East negotiations going. He told me that he had a commitment in Aspen w you two and the
conference, but after we talked, he decided to go and asked me to tell you. He is very sorry, obviously, but I'm grateful
that he accepted my request. I hope you all understand and give him a raincheck.

  If you were interested, he might be able to satellite in if you have the technology available.

  He should land around Sam Aspen time. Let me know what penance I owe you. And pls explain to Teddy. As ever, H
