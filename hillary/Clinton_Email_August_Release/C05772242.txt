JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A planned Israeli-Palestinian summit due to be held in Paris by the end of the month has been
rescheduled, the Israeli prime minister's office said on October 16, a sign of increased strain over stalled peace
talks. French President Sarkozy invited Prime Minister Netanyahu, Palestinian President Abbas and Egyptian President
Mubarak to meet before the end of October, although an exact date for the summit had not been set. "Following joint
consultations it has been agreed to set a new date for the preparatory meeting," a statement from Netanyahu's office
said, adding there was no chance of holding it on Oct 21, which was previously thought to be possible. "We are looking
for a new date that works for everybody, although there is nothing firm scheduled yet," an Israeli government official
told Reuters.
