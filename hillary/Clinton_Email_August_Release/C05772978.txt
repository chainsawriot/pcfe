Dear Anne-Marie,

  I was just reading your two wonderful memos on 5/ P accomplishments and the QDDR.




I also want to thank you for a wonderful year of work, creativity, collaboration and progress. I know the start for all of us
was shaky, but we have hit our stride and you are such a valuable member of the team, a generator of ideas, a
conductor of talent and even a necessary nudge from time to time. Thank you for making this journey w me.

I will schedule the S/P visit and photo as soon as I can. Until we see one another next week, be well and take care
(please!)

All the best, Hillary
