Subject: Thank you

Amidst alll the real work emails I just wanted to say thank you.                               4



I suppose today's event made things feel very real and I didn't get a chance to say thank you after the event.

Also, please do let the Secretary know I appreciated her incredible generous comments yesterday and today --
especially nice comments about Shivam and the kids -- and will do my best to live up to them. :-)

Thx!

Raj
