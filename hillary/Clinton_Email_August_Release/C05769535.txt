Subject                        FY 2011



Tim Rieser said today our allocation in the Senate for FY11 is $2.6 billion below our request. Haven't seen a
break out of the numbers yet, but that is far better than how the House treated us. We are expecting the
Senate to mark-up State/Foreign ops on July 22nd.
