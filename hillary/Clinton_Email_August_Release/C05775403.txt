Looks like we will be leaving it to them. I spoke to someone who was there, and he said the whole int community was
offended. HK said people would rather be with TB than have the pscs. HK has a press avail at 1030 tomorrow...

Karzai firm on deadline for security firms

by Javed Hamim Kakar on 24 October, 2010 - 16:54 KABUL (PAN): President Hamid Karzai has firmly rejected a joint
request from US, British and German ambassadors to extend the deadline for disbanding private security firms in the
country, his office said on Sunday.

At a special meeting, President Karzai told the foreign officials that the private security companies had established a
parallel government in the war-torn country, something he would not allow.

Ambassadors Karl Eikenberry (US), William Patey (UK), Ambassador Rijdiger Konig (Germany),ISAF Commander Gen.
David Petraeus and NATO's special civilian representative, Mark Sidwell, were among the foreign officials who attended
the meeting.

Karzai issued a four-month deadline for dissolving all foreign and Afghan security companies, a move he believes will
help stabilise Afghanistan."I addressed the problem five years ago but our international friends warned of halting
development projects," Karzai was quoted in a statement from his office.

"I again raised the issue three years ago and international community representatives asked for an additional two years.
But now the Afghan government is determined to dissolve the companies," Karzai told the foreign envoys.

Japan's deputy ambassador also took part in the meeting. The president told the ambassadors to convey their security
concerns about the implementation of projects to the government. Karzai would continue to meet foreign officials who
expressed serious concerns over the presidential decree banning the security firms, the statement added.
