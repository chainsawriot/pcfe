Dear Melanne,

Thank you; We, group of women leaders met with Secretary Clinton. It was a short meeting,
introduction and photo opportunity. But, I hope the event send a message to our
government that women should be supported. I also think that the Embassy will consider more
vision of women of Kosova.
Secretary Clinton was just remarkable. Her message for our, also Belgrade leadership was clear
and strait forward; dialogue, dialogue, dialogue as two independent states!
The admiration expressed by the population in the streets as motorcade was passing, meeting
with PM and acting President, open meeting with students and media was impressive. She is
really inspiration for all.
Maybe was not a right time, but I only wish she has pressed the PM on corruption practices.
Thank you once again for facilitating this meeting.

Best regards,

Vjosa

Dear Melanne,

Hope this message finds you well.
I am trying to follow your work and every time I run into information that involves you as a
speaker or presenter, I know that strong advocacy for the benefit of women is coming for the
future.

I am starting a foundation, with a objective to advocate policies on health, environment and
human rights. Women in the region have serious obstacles to access health care and services,
and are suffering from a luck of information. Many preventable diseases are taking its toll
because of the lack of information and facilities, especially regarding breast cancer and cervical
cancer. Also, laws on health care do not require for preventive services such as mammography,
pap smear and other preventive services. I am planning to work on different level, not excluding
other target groups but starting with women.
Today, media have announce the visit of Secretary Hillary Clinton in the region, including
Kosovo. Is there any chance to meet with her during short visit in Prishtina? I know she is
coming to assist the dialogue between Prishtina and Belgrade, but she would be even more
helpful if she meets me and other women.
New early elections are coming in few months and she would bust our confidence and would
support better participation of women and better election result.
I am afraid that our government officials are going to meet alone and/or be very selective who
can meet her because is going to have impact on the election.
I am not with any political party but would be wonderful and extremely helpful for the support
