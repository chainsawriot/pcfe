Pat,
   I heard it went well. They got to the Montana when there was still about a half hour of light.



                                    American SAR personnel discussed each specific site within the Montana with the
families and they could see the immense challenge of doing more than had already been done.
                                                          Recovery operations had already begun and seven bodies (if I
remember the number correctly) were extracted this afternoon, including a number of Amcits.



                                 Cheers, David
