FW: Just talked to yet ANOTHER....member of the Trans community telling me that she would "crawl through broken
glass" for HRC. A LOT of people are very grateful to her for her support of the travel changes that the State Dept. has
initiated. One more time for me to remind them that she's still "our girl." Have much fun and a little relaxation this
weekend!
