FYI. Mostly good news. I am already focusing on Turkey. Met with my Turkish counter-part last week and have a trip
planned for early June.                                                                                                1.4(D)

I'll keep you posted as things move forward. Will also send you an email on the high side about my SSCI hearing last
week.
