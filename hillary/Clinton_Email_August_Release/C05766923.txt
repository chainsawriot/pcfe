Subject: FW: Note for the Secretary

Dear Cheryl,

I hope that you have been able to find a bit of time during the holidays to catch your breath and get ready for
next year. I have attached a note to the Secretary that reviews our agenda in Mexico at the end of 2009, and key
challenges for the coming year. Could you pass this to her for me? Many thanks,

Carlos
