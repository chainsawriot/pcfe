Bombings in Moscow

Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of this morning's bombings in Moscow, their families, and all the people
of Russia. This brutal assault on innocent civilians is another reminder that terrorism is a threat to peace-loving people
everywhere and must be met with unwavering resolve. I will offer my personal condolences to Foreign Minister Lavrov
later today in Ottawa. Together with our G8 partners, we will discuss how to improve international counterterrorism
coordination and cooperation. I was in Moscow earlier this month, and I know the resilience and determination of the
Russian people. The United States stands with them today and everyday in solidarity against violent extremism in all its
forms.
