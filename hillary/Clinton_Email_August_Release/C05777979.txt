Senator DeMint is insisting that he and Sujay sit down to personally review her post-hearing QFR answers. This is highly
unusual. We offered Sujay up right away, but DeMint's staff insisted that the Senator was only available to meet on
December 16 (the Senate target adjournment date is December 17). This effectively scuttles any chance Sujay has of
getting confirmed this Congress.

Unfortunately, we don't have much recourse. Sujay's nomination will remain on Tuesday's business meeting agenda, but
given his request, DeMint will exercise his prerogative and ask that she be held over. With no other business meetings
scheduled this year, she'll remain stuck in Committee.

There's another factor at play here too. We learned yesterday afternoon that Sujay has taken it upon herself to reach out
to different Senator's offices. I don't know what exactly she's been saying, but the leg officer (a State Department fellow)
handling Sujay's nomination got an email from Hatch's office. He has been supportive of her and we have a good working
relationship with them. I don't know what Sujay said, but the message back from Hatch's person is that "while we do
support her, this really makes us question her common sense and judgment." We obviously told her to stop her outreach
campaign.

Finally, Hatch's office also informed us that Brownback is rumored to be considering a hold on Sujay's nomination if
DeMint for any reason relents.

I assume that someone is keeping you up to date on Sujay's confirmation process. Here Is the latest. I am
worried that the Rs simply will run out the clock so that we need start from scratch in early

next year.

Not sure if there is anything I can do, but if there is please let me know-
