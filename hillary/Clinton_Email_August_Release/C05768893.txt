I've sent the file to Ops. They'll fax over a black and white version momentarily, and send a color copy via courier.

The plan is to have a large screen off to your side so that it won't get in the way of a tight shot. We've worked with
National Geographic on the photos -- some of which are quite stunning -- and they'll pace the presentation slowly with
long transitions so it's not distracting. I've folded the images into the text I'm sending you, but you'll have a
teleprompter on stage tomorrow.

Thanks so much. As to visuals, will we have handouts or power point on screen?

Yes -- I'm finalizing the visuals now and should have it for you in the next half hour.
