Subject: (Reuters) Syria rejects U.S. criticism over Lebanon

DAMASCUS (Reuters) â€” Syria rejected U.S. accusations that it was destabilizing Lebanon and said it did not need U.S.
advice on how to deal with its smaller neighbor. President Bashar al-Assad Assad told al-Hayat newspaper in an
interview published last week that the U.S. "created chaos in every place it entered." Two days later the U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice accused Damascus of joining forces with Iran and the Lebanese Shi'ite
movement Hezbollah to undermine Lebanon.
   U.S. Undersecretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Jeffrey Feltman also told the Washington Post there would not
be significant improvement in ties with Syria "as long as Syria's friends are undermining stability in Lebanon", a
reference to Hezbollah.
   An official Syrian statement published on Thursday said: "We do not need Feltman's advice because Syria is
exercising its role through an independent decision to serve the interests of its people and the stability and security of
the region."
