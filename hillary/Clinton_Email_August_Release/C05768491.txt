Re: AIPAC speech


This memo does not address specific policy initiatives.

What I've written are options. Use what you like, or none at all. Here are some ideas:

    1. Hold Bibi's feet to the fire, remind everyone he was at Wye, his key participant event in
       the peace process, and that it was successful.

    2. Reassure all players of our commitment to the process and the solution (whatever the
       language is).

    3. Perhaps most controversial, I would argue something you should do is that, while
       praising AIPAC, remind it in as subtle but also direct a way as you can that it does not
       have a monopoly over American Jewish opinion. Bibi is stage managing US Jewish
       organizations (and neocons, and the religious right, and whomever else he can muster)
       against the administration. AIPAC itself has become an organ of the Israeli right,
       specifically Likud. By acknowledging J Street you give them legitimacy, credibility and
       create room within the American Jewish community for debate supportive of the
       administration's pursuit of the peace process. Just by mentioning J Street in passing,
       AIPAC becomes a point on the spectrum, not the controller of the spectrum. I suggest a
       way how to do this below.


 Some language:

    1. On US national security interest, Israel's security and the peace process:

 The reason the US has always supported Israel since the moment President Harry S. Truman
 decided to recognize the State of Israel is that it is in the US national security interest and
 consistent with our values. It is in our interest to support a thriving democracy in the Middle East

Only through the marketplace of ideas will sound policies to help resolve complicated and
seemingly intransigent problems be developed. This administration values everybody's views.
They are important. You are important. We welcome views across the spectrum, from AIPAC to
J Street. All these views are legitimate and must be heard and considered.
