In addition to the longer chain, you should know that the location of these units is very problematic and would
significantly change the demographic dynamics of the city and the ability to divide it, if we get to the point. Har Homa is
located in southern Jerusalem just north of Bethlehem. The B and C phases of Har Homa will expand the neighborhood
eastward (hotdog shape), going a long ways to cutting off Bethlehem for Jerusalem and the Arab neighborhoods there.

Subject: (AP) Israel announces new east Jerusalem housing plans

JERUSALEM - (AP)         Israel says it is moving ahead with plans to build 1,300 new apartments in disputed east
Jerusalem. The Interior Ministry's announcement and its timing could embarrass Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, who is visiting the U.S. Washington is already frustrated over his refusal to curb settlement
construction. Palestinians condemned the plans. They claim east Jerusalem for a future capital. The
government plans to expand the Har Homa neighborhood by 978 apartments and to build 320 new apartments
in the Ramot neighborhood.
