JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel has given preliminary approval for 130 new apartments in disputed east Jerusalem. The
November 29 decision by Jerusalem city authorities comes as peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians are at a
standstill over building in the West Bank and east Jerusalem. City Hall spokesman Elie Isaacson says the new housing
was approved for Gilo, a Jewish housing development in east Jerusalem. The project still needs final approval from
Israel's Interior Ministry to go ahead.
