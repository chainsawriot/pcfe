Subject: (Reuters) Afghanistan announces last set of election results

KABUL (Reuters) â€” Afghanistan announced on December 1 the final batch of results from a September 18 parliamentary
election, with poll organizers aiming to wrap up a vote marred by widespread fraud and pave the way for a new
parliament. The Independent Election Commission (IEC) said preliminary winners would hold their seats in southeastern
Ghazni province. Election officials released results for Afghanistan's other 33 provinces and for Kuchi nomads a week
ago but delayed Ghazni because of technical issues and irregularities.
