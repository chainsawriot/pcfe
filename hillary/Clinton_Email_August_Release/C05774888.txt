Re: Hague meeting



On your meeting on Friday, May 14, with new British Foreign Secretary William Hague you might explore a number of
issues below. (I've discussed with Shaun.)

1.    Northern Ireland. Cameron has pledged to reduce public sector spending in NI. But the impact of public sector
spending there is not the same as in other parts of the UK because of 40 years of troubles. Political stability depends
upon economic stability. Removing funding specifically threatens community policing, creating a vacuum that the Real
IRA and other men of violence would rush into. Cutting the public sector would make it difficult to increase private
sector investment. Does the new government understand the US interest in NI and appreciate the fragility of the
situation?
2.    Defense and Foreign Policy Cuts. The new government program is to slash the deficit, cutting deeply into
government programs. This really cannot be done without defense and foreign policy reductions. Seek claficiation on
exactly whether and where these cuts be made. Will they affect Afghanistan policy and over what schedule? How will
cuts in the foreign service affect British influence in other areas?
3.    Trident and Nuclear Deterrent. The coalition agreement between the Conservative and Liberal Democrats allows
the LDs to abstain in parliamentary votes on four issues that will apparently let the Tories have their way: marriage tax
allowances; nuclear power; college tuition fees; and Trident and the nuclear deterrent. During the campaign, the LDs ran
on eliminating the Trident and erasing the UK nuclear deterrent. How will this actually work in practice?

4.   Political Changes. The new government, because the coalition is fundamentally at odds with itself, has proposed to
pass a parliamentary bill that establishes a five year term for a government and furthermore establishes that a vote of
no confidence can only be passed on a 55 percent vote. You might just seek Hague's view on how this will work.
