Ruto was leader of "no" campaign, so his apparent graceful concession is important.

Subject: Ruto and the "No" team concede defeat in Kenya's Constitutional Referendum

Colleagues,

Shortly before 2 PM Nairobi time, William Ruto and the "No" team conceded defeat. Saying that "Kenyans have
spoken" and that the constitution has been accepted at the referendum, Ruto said that he will now focus on fixing the
contentious issues outlined by the "No" team by participating in the implementation process. Somewhat
disingenuously, Ruto is also saying that a "majority of Kenyans either did not vote or voted against the new
constitution." He has urged his supporters to remain peaceful and accept the outcome.

At about 1 PM, church leaders held a press conference acknowledging the draft has passed, and stating that the church
will work to address the new constitution's "moral issues of concern."

On a personal note, I will be departing post tomorrow morning and will leave the office in a few hours. It has been an
honor and privilege to work with a wonderful team in support of Kenya's constitutional reform, and I am thankful to
have witnessed such a peaceful and positive outcome. I wish my colleagues the best as they turn now to the task of
supporting the implementation. Glenn Warren (WarrenGS@state.gov / +254-717-727-842) is the primary point of
contact for constitutional issues going forward.

Best regards,

Jonathan P. Howard
