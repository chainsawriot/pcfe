Ed Miliband's victory was carried by an anti-Blair undercurrent. In the first round voting, David was ahead. But when the
votes of Ed Balls was distributed to the second choice of voters, they put Ed over. Balls represents Gordon, but even
more a distancing from New Labour. Ed's use of Iraq as an issue is symbolic of the repudiation of New Labour. Ed had
more labor union votes for leader, which accounted for one-third of total. Ed's "new generation" rhetoric covers that
regression and continuing reactive impulse. Now the shadow cabinet, due to a new decision, will be elected by the party.
Ed is the former environment minister and good on green issues, of course, but has no foreign policy perspective
yet instinctively to the left, which means anti-Afghanistan mission as currently conceived, it should go without saying.
David lost precisely because he held responsible positions.
