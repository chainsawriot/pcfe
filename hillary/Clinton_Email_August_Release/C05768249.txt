In the midst of all that isn't working with the Sudanese elections we rammed through an election monitoring tip-line system
over the last 3 weeks. More great work from Katie Stanton. She's a star.

Team,
We have great news to report. We have just succeeded in completing end to end testing of SMS messaging
using the two short codes Zain has provided through our Sudan Vote Monitor system.

So at this point all systems are GO for tomorrow's start of voting.
This was done through an incredible collaboration. My sincere thanks to Katie and Sawsan who made all this
possible, Casper and the great flexibility of Clickatell, my own team Amin in Khartoum, Selvam in Seattle,
Rene in Houston, and our Director Eiman in Lancaster.
Great effort everyone, now the real work begins!

All the Best,

Fareed
