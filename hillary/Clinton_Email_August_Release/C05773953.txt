Subject: (AIP) Israeli Cabinet to consider US settlement proposal

JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel's prime minister will ask his Cabinet to consider a package of security and diplomatic incentives
the U.S. proposed to entice Israel to renew limits on settlement construction and revive peace talks with the
Palestinians. However, the Palestinians are expressing strong reservations about the proposal. Although Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat did not reject it outright, he says a decision on whether to endorse it would be made after
consultations with Palestinian and Arab leaders.
