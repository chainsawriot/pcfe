Mark,
You've probably heard that a bomb went off thisd morning in Laghman province, Aghanistan. The Governor of the
province is in Madrid at the end of a one-week visit to Poland, Germany, and Spain.

His message has been of support for ISAF and international development, which is helping Afghanistan defeat the enemy,
confront radical terrorists, and rebuild.

The Governor is considering release of a a statement from Madrid to news outlets this afternoon. We have offered
assistance in reaching media. Will keep you posted.

Please share this info, as appropriate, with those who should know in the Dept.

FOR KABUL:
While it appears that Insurgents hoped to capitalize on the NATO summit to send a message, and likely chose Laghman
because of it has been relatively peaceful and secure, this incident underscores the Governor's talking points that, while
Laghman has been peaceful and made great progress on all fronts in the past 9 years, Afghanstan still needs security and
development assistance to defeat the terrorists, who only bring destruction, fear, and oppression.

Tom Genton,
PAO Madrid

I agree. All the key Spanish MFA and GOS officials are on the ground in Lisbon, so go ahead and handle it. Just keep us
in the loop on what comes out of it.

Mark,
After several unsuccessful attempts to reach contacts at MFA or Moncloa (Spanish Presidency), at 8:15 pm today I
reached the Moncloa Director of International Communication, Juan Cierco, on the ground in Lisbon, who indicated to
me that he had just received official word from you (albeit through a third party) that a 15-min Clinton-Trinidad meeting
had been confirmed for 10:30 am Saturday morning, and that the Secretary had agreed to a photo spray (no remarks or
Q&A).

True or False?

Mark/Andrew-

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs just sent out a press advisory pegging the bilat at 10:30 Saturday, pending confirmation. I
will send you a scan. Are they jumping the gun or is this on?

Jeff,
Thanks. First a point of clarification - we are reaching out to the spanish team here for a bilat but no meeting is confirmed.
We are checking their availability here. That is all.

That said, its highly likely it will happen, so please feel free to have the spanish reach out to me here on the ground. If its
via email please also cc paul harrison from usnato and andrew johnson, s staff. We are happy to discuss ground rules and
such with the spanish team at their convenience.

Mark—

S has apparently scheduled a bilat with the Spanish Foreign Minister on the margins of the Lisbon summits. The MFA
press staff wants to coordinate with you on press availability and ground rules. If you agree, I would like to put you
directly in contact with them to work out the details. If you prefer, we can operate as a filter for you, but with the event
on top of us direct contact is probably going to work better.

Yours, Jeff
