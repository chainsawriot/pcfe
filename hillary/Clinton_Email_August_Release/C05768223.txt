Fyi -- not sure of timing of your call.

Terrible news about Poland.

I'm on the ground and reachable at your convenience.

Subject: Albright Call with Otunbayeva

Jake: Madeline Albright very kindly called to provide a readout of a call she had today with Roza Otunbayeva,
the head of the Kryrgystan provisional administration. She characterized it as a good call. Otunbayeva was
pleased to talk, said she wants to restore democracy to Kyrgystan and have a government that is responsible
to the people. She said she personally wants to have a "high reputation" as a result of her democracy
efforts. MKA offered NDI's full assistance in organizing the elections Otunbayeva has pledged to hold in six
months. Otunbayeva expressed her appreciation, but did not make any specific requests. Interestingly,
Otunbayeva volunteered that Kyrgystan would keep Manas open. That is more forward leaning than what she
told our Charge yesterday; she told him that they would need to review the Manas agreement but would keep
it open pending that review. I thanked MKA for the readout and promised to pass it on to you. A memo and
call sheet will be on its way shortly to the Secretary for her to call Otunbayeva tomorrow. Best, Bob
