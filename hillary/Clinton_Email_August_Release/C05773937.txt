Jake just downloaded with me from your conversation w/ him yesterday re the Interim Report. I just want to reassure
you that I get it completely; you saw a much earlier draft than I would have liked. I'll be working on it all weekend and
we'll make you proud. Have a good trip -- I used to be on the board of thr US-Islamic World Forum and went a couple of
times. AM
