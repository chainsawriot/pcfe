Lissa has done heroic work pulling this together â€” it is still rough in many places and needs lots to be added with respect
to what the QDDR is actually going to do in each of the three buckets, but it now makes a strong case




Lissa, Sonni and I have all blocked out time tomorrow and Saturday to make revisions and get it to a point where we can
recirculate to Jack and Raj, as well as to Bill Burns and Jim, who both want to see it.

Happy reading (we hope). AM
