COMMANDER TO KABUL FOR TALKS

LONDON (Reuters) â€” U.S. General David Petraeus, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, said NATO-
led forces had facilitated the passage of a senior Taliban commander to Kabul to hold talks with the Afghan
government. Speaking to an audience in London, Petraeus said the move was part of U.S. and NATO support for Afghan
President Hamid Karzai's reconciliation discussions with the Taliban. "In certain respect we do facilitate that, given that,
needless to say it would not be the easiest of tasks for a senior Taliban commander to enter Afghanistan and make his
way to Kabul if ISAF (International Security Assistance Force) were not....aware of it and therefore allows it to take
place," he said. "That's about as far as I can go on that at this point."
