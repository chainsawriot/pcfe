Also, if they're holding a mtg, I would think they'd want the UN/Bill and he can't go either (it's a CVC thing).

Please see attached additional information and question from Canadian government prior to this afternoon's 1300
phone call. Specifically, the Canadian government is asking whether the Secretary could come to Montreal for the GOC's
"prep" donors meeting the evening of 1/23 or morning of 1/24? [Note: Montreal has world's second largest Haitian
diaspora, hence location.]

Good morning Roberta! Congratulations on a successful visit by the Secretary of State. We are looking forward to this
afternoon's teleconference. After opening remarks, Minister Cannon will ask Prime Minister Bellerive to speak and the
UN (we may only have DPKO LeRoy on line due to visit of Sec Gen to Haiti). He will then ask FM Amorim and Sec State
Clinton to provide their views on the situation and then open the floor to Kouchner and others. Response has been good
and most will be represented at FM level (Mexico/Espinosa may still be in flight from Japan, and Argentina and Costa
Rica will be Vice-Ministers).




There is as well agreement in principle to begin laying the groundwork for a broader Donors Conference on
Reconstruction and our offer to host a preparatory meeting on January 25th has been well received. However, early
indications are that the EU has a conflict as they have their General Relations and Foreign Relations meetings scheduled
for that day. As the EU would be essential for such a meeting we are scrambling to look for alternative dates. Given the
momentum we would rather go earlier than later. Minister Cannon would be available to host this on the weekend of
the 23-24th of January (dinner on the 23rd, meeting on the morning of the 24th). However, I believe that Ambassador
Jacobsen had indicated that Mrs. Clinton has another engagement on the 23rd. Could you please let me know, before
this afternoon's teleconference, if in principle, Mrs.Clinton might be available to attend a meeting in Montreal on the
evening of the 23rd or the morning of the 24th?




Many thanks Roberta.




Alex
