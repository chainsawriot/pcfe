Supreme Court Justice Jim Johnson, known both for his segregationist political activities in the 1950s and dabbling in the
political campaign against Bill Clinton during his presidency, died yesterday.

A Faulkner County sheriff's office spokesman, Lt. Matt Rice, said Johnson was found dead in his home about 10 a.m.
Saturday with an apparently self-inflicted chest wound from a .30-30 rifle. Johnson had been beset by medical problems,
he said. Roller-McNutt Funeral Home in Conway will be handling arrangements.

He was 85. Here's a standard biographical history <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_D.johnson> . This will end his
prolific and pointed letters to the editor (unless some are still in the pipeline), delivered on stationery marked with his
name for his Conway home, "White Haven."

Justice Jim was a courtly man and lively company, gracious in social interaction with friend and political foe. But Mark
Anthony's words in Julius Caesar about men's deeds come, unavoidably, to mind. As recently as 1990, he worked in an
effort to preserve state Amendment 44, the states rights amendment aimed at curbing integration that was his
brainchild. It had long been declared unconstitutional by federal courts and was barely repealed by voters.
