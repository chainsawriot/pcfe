Subject:                           Hill calls on settlement moratorium



The team believes that some high level strategic targeted Hill calls are needed to explain our position on the settlement
moratorium extension. The thought was:

S calls to Kerry, Berman, Lowey, Feinstein;
Mitchell calls to Levin, Lugar, Leahy.

We would get points to you tomorrow, for calls over the weekend if possible, or Monday.

Does this work?
