Subject: US Chairing OECD Ministerial

OECD Counsel chose US to Chair their 50th Anniversary Ministerial with Secretary Clinton heading the delegation.
Germany bowed out of their desire to co-chair but agreed to Vice Chair and confirmed Chancellor Merkel will deliver a
speech. We'll firm up schedule in coming days. Looking forward to it!
