GHAZI AIR BASE (AP) â€” The United States will increase its aid to flood-ravaged Pakistan to $150 million, U.S. Sen. John
Kerry said, stressing that Washington did not want Islamist extremism to increase on the back of the crisis. The United
States has deployed army helicopters to hard hit areas as part of a package worth $90 million. U.S. Sen. John Kerry, who
is visiting Pakistan to see the flood damage, said that would increase to $150 million. The figure is expected to be
announced at a U.N. general assembly meeting in New York August 19. He was speaking after meeting U.S. military
personnel taking part in helicopter relief missions.
