I can't believe that the conspiracy around me worked! I was so mindful of your murderous schedule today
that it never even occurred to me that you would tack on yet one more thing.
Your showing up was a fabulous surprise, so emblematic of your generosity it so many ways and a wonderful reminder of
the cause that you started me on and grew over these almost 20 years.
Many thanks.

Should you talk to the new Dutch FM in Lisbon, you might thank him for their work on 1325. They are helping other
countries, including in Afghanistan and we hope that they will continue in the new govt.

Good travels and heartfelt thanks.
Melanne
