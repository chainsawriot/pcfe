Time Magazine is including Nancy Pelosi in their 100 Issue, and as you know from writing for others and being written
about, they ask other notables to write the accompanying text. They are inviting you to write the text that accompanies
Pelosi's

We all think you should do, the timing allows you to write a bit about the importance of health care.
