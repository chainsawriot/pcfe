Howard-

Thank you again for your inquiry. Here is a background from our Consular Affairs Office on where this
currently stands.

The Office of Children's Issues here at State began working with Mr. Bower in August 2009 when his sons
were abducted by their mother to Egypt notwithstanding a court order from a family court in Massachusetts that
had given the father sole custody of the children. Since then, as you know, Mr. Bower has not been able to see
his children.

On August 31, 2010, Embassy Cairo conducted a welfare visit (the first) with the Bower boys at the Ministry of
Justice. The Government of Egypt played a constructive role in arranging this consular visit. As you may
know, Senator Kerry has been following this case closely and issued a statement after the visit:

           "I applaud the Egyptian government's facilitation of American consular access today in Cairo for Noor
           and Ramsey. I hope that this is a first step that can lead to a positive outcome. It is past time for the
           children to be returned to Massachusetts where they belong. The facts are clear: the two boys were
           taken illegally to Egypt by their mother more than a year ago in blatant contravention of a U.S. court
           ruling that granted their father, Colin Bower, sole custody. I have conveyed my concerns over this

        matter to the State Department and hope that the involvement of the U.S. government will help bring
        this tragedy to its rightful conclusion by reunited these boys with their father."

The Department and US Embassy's Executive Office have raised this case with high level Egyptian officials
many times.

They are actively pushing the Egyptian Government to help resolve this. Unfortunately, Egypt is not a member
of the Hague Convention on abductions, so left behind parents must depend on the local courts to do the right
thing. In 2000, Egypt has formed a "Good Intentions Subcommittee" to help mediate between parents. There
have been some good results, although it all depends on the willingness of parents to work together. We also
have an MOU with the Egyptian Government that allows for consular access. Embassy Cairo relied on the
MOU when they approached the Egyptian Good Intentions Sub-Committee for help in scheduling a welfare
visit with the Bower children. Without the intervention of that sub-committee, it's likely the Embassy would
not have been able to conduct the August 31 welfare visit with the children.

Our folks will continue working closely with Mr. Bower, our Embassy in Cairo, and with the Government of
Egypt to help find a solution that reunites Mr. Bower with his children.

Best.
