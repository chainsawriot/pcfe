YEONPYEONG ISLAND (AP) - The United States and the ROK are staging joint war games as planned. An official with the
ROK's joint chiefs of staff says the drills kicked off when ships from both countries entered the exercise zone. A
spokesman for the U.S. military in the ROK says U.S. ships are still steaming toward the area and the drills will not
officially begin until later in the day.
