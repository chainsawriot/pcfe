Flotilla Organizer Claims Ship Will Not Sail Directly to Gaza

(U) Coordinator of the Mariam's efforts, Samar al-Hajj, told the LBC television channel on Saturday that contacts are
ongoing with countries near Gaza in order to acquire permission for the ship to dock at one of their ports. She
complained, "It seems as if there is universal war against us....We will not allow anyone to cancel the ship's trip." She
added that the ship will not head to Gaza directly from Tripoli, stressing, "The ship cannot be the reason for the start of a
war."
