Subject: (AP) UN launches $2 billion Pakistan appeal

UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The UN says it's making the largest disaster appeal ever, asking the world's governments and
humanitarian groups to raise a total $2 billion for Pakistan's flood victims. Previously, the largest appeal for disaster
relief was the $1.5 billion in aid for victims of the devastating January earthquake in Haiti. The $2 billion appeal
announced on September 17 for Pakistan relief includes the nearly $500 million the UN asked countries and
organizations to donate shortly after the onset of massive flooding nearly two months ago.
