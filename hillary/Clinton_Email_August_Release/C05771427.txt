LEIDSCHENDAM (AP) - The president of a UN-backed tribunal set up to prosecute the assassins of former Lebanese
Prime Minister Ran Hariri made an impassioned plea for Lebanese to give the court a chance to show it can dispense
impartial justice. Italian Judge Antonio Cassese also told Lebanese journalists visiting the Special Tribunal for Lebanon
he hopes prosecutors will issue an indictment by December in the 2005 truck bombing that killed Hariri and 22 others on
Beirut's Mediterranean waterfront.
