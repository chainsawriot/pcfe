Subject:                          E3+Ashton



Steve Mull is proposing that you do a conference call with the E3 FMs and Ashton sometime this week. Here is the
rationale and background:

The European Union Foreign Affairs Council, comprised of all 27 EU Foreign Ministers, will next meet on May 10. In a
conversation April 26, Bill Burns persuaded the E3 and European Commission to support adding to the agenda of that
meeting a discussion of preparations for the sanctions the EU will impose following passage of a UNSCR.

The European Council, comprised of the EU's heads of government, will meet on June 16-17 â€” a meeting which could
direct the imposition of such sanctions if we succeed in passing an UNSCR by then.

The purpose of your teleconference would be to hear from the E3 and Ashton a status report on the EU's preparations
to impose such sanctions, and to discuss how the U.S. could best support the EU's forward progress. It would
supplement experts' level consultations we have been conducting for several weeks, including meetings on May 3 and
May 6.

The measures the Europeans are considering include bans on new Iranian bank branches in the EU, correspondent
banking relationships, new investment in the Iranian energy sector, and on access for Iranian ships to European ports.
