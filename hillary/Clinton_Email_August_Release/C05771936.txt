Subject: (AP) Netanyahu wants Israeli troops at Palestinian border

JERUSALEM (AP) - Prime Minister Netanyahu says Israel wants to keep its troops on the eastern border of a future
Palestinian state. Palestinians reject the idea and have proposed an international force along the West Bank's border
with Jordan as part of a peace deal. Netanyahu told U.S. Jewish leaders in a conference call on September 20 that "the
only force that can be relied on to defend the Jewish people is the Israeli Defense Force." Netanyahu says an
international force can't ensure Israel's security. He fears Palestinian militants will attack Israel from within a Palestinian
state if Israeli troops are withdrawn from the West Bank-Jordan border. Palestinian President Abbas maintains that an
Israeli troop presence would infringe upon Palestinian sovereignty.
