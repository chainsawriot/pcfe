GAZA (Reuters) - An Israeli air strike in the central Gaza Strip September 27 killed three gunmen belonging to the Islamic
Jihad group, Palestinian medics said. An Israeli military spokeswoman said a group of militants preparing to fire a rocket
at Israel had been targeted, and that the air strike caused an explosion and a secondary blast. Ambulance workers and
medical officials said they had recovered three bodies from the site of an explosion that occurred after darkness fell
outside Bureij refugee camp, near the Israel-Gaza frontier. Hamas television reports said the blast had been caused
either by an Israeli air strike or cross-border tank fire.
