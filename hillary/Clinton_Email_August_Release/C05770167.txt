              Maariv: Netanyahu won't meet Clinton; 'sources' say she
              "isn't relevant"

  Do they honestly think that publicizing a quote like this, on record or off, works to their advantage?


       Israeli diplomatic [euphemism for Prime Minister's Office -- DR] sources said: "Clinton isn't relevant and
       is out of the circle of influence. Mitchell has taken over the peace process to a great extent and Obama, in
       any event, is the important person in this story because he is the one who decides."




                    etanyahu to meet Obama, but not Clinton
       Eli Bardenstein, Maariv, July 1 2010 [page 7; Hebrew original here and at bottom of post]




                         rime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is to leave next week for Washington, where he will meet
           with US President Barack Obama. Rather curiously, he is not scheduled to meet with Secretary of State
           Hillary Clinton in the course of his visit to Washington.
           Contrary to his previous visit in March, this time the US administration intends to create the impression,
           outwardly at least, that the severe crisis in the relationship has passed and that the relations between the
           two countries are as strong as ever. In order to bolster that impression, the two leaders will meet the media
           together and will be photographed. As opposed to the previous time, Netanyahu will also be put up at Blair
           House, the official White House guesthouse, and not at a hotel.
           That said, officials in Washington are waiting apprehensively for the answers that Netanyahu will provide in
           the course of the meeting, which is expected to address the transition from the proximity talks that are at an
           impasse to direct negotiations. Obama, apparently, will demand that Netanyahu agree to extend the
           construction freeze in Judea and Samaria beyond the September 26 expiration date in hope of securing PA
