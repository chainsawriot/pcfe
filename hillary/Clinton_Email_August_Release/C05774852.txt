Senate Republicans Filibuster Fair Pay For Women
Matt Finkelstein

The first bill President Obama signed after taking office was the Lilly
Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which made it easier for women to seek justice for
pay discrimination. At the time, Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), Kay Bailey
Hutchison (R-TX) and Olympia Snowe (R-ME) joined with Democrats to
overcome strong Republican opposition to the bill.

But today, all three Republican senators voted against a motion to
proceed on the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill that "would further
strengthen current laws against gender-based wage discrimination." The
motion was defeated by a vote of 58-41, falling two votes short of the 60
needed for the bill to be considered on the Senate floor.

This is not the first time the Paycheck Fairness Act has stalled in the
Senate. In 2008, the upper chamber failed to vote on the bill after it was
approved by the House, which passed the legislation again in 2009 with
the support of 10 Republicans.

Women earn barely three-quarters of what their male counterparts make
for the same work, but conservatives have invented a number of
ludicrous reasons for opposing equal pay legislation. For example, the
Heritage Foundation has suggested that equal pay laws actually hurt
women because businesses simply won't hire them if they are required to
pay them fair wages. And Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) has claimed that
women would receive better compensation if they just had more
"education and training."
