Subject: (Reuters) US House panel approves China currency bill

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. congressional panel, in a move likely to increase trade tensions with China, approved a
bill that allows the United States to slap duties on goods from countries with fundamentally undervalued currencies.

   The House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee backed the legislation on a voice vote, clearing the way
for the full House to take up the measure next week. It may never become law, however, as it faces an uncertain future
in the Senate.
