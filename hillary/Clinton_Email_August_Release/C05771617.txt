This is not good news, but it is very helpful. Understandably there is an enormous amount of emotion around
this. My view, which may not be heeded by the family and their supporters, is that a little patience would be
helpful here to see what might happen back channel. Again, I really appreciate the time you are putting into
this. In the big picture this is small potatoes, but of course to the family, it is everything. Howard

Howard:



Thanks for this — I spent yesterday having folks in the region, our ambassador in Egypt, and our folks in
Consular affairs at main state review and consult with each other. There appears to be misinformation
circulating. While the GOE is sympathetic to all parties, the GOE has not indicated any willingness to interfere
in the proceedings of the Egyptian courts that currently are considering Mr. Bower's challenge to the Egyptian
custody decree. Including with regard to any of the matters flagged below.



We do not know when that judicial process will be completed, although the next hearing is scheduled for
October. The Embassy is currently trying to ensure that Mr. Bower, who is en route to Egypt now, will be able
to see his sons as called for in a current Egyptian court order.



 I appreciate your sharing this for context — it is helpful.



 Best.

Hi Cheryl,

 I thought you would be interested in this information which comes from a US Govt source outside the State
Dept. Don't know if the Secretary was aware of the back channel discussions at the time she raised the case.
Mubaralc apparently feels no one has responded to his wish list which may have something to do with turning
over the kids into a visitation

Gov-



If you feel comfortable - there is one more piece of info we believe cheryl mills needs to have - and that is - the
fact that mubarek is trying to do some horse trading regarding the return of the bower boys. Mubarek wants -
health care in usa for himself, some chit w clintons in future, consideration on human rights bill, and
consideration for his successor. I am not saying that USG has to give in on these. But I am saying that USG
has to be aware that mubarek wants to solve our issue - but wants his requests to at least be acknowledged.



Might you pass to cheryl? She is our only directly line to hrc at moment. We have made the bureaucrats aware
- but its not making it up the food chain
