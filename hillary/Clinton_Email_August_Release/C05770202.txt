Colleagues -

For your situational awareness, I wanted to inform you that the SECDEF has approved the OSD package responding to
the State ExecSec memo regarding Pakistan flood relief.

The package approves the transport of personnel and humanitarian assistance/supplies (including non-DOD relief
supplies), activation of assessment teams, and intel/recon support. The package includes the use of up to six helos.

Best Regards,

Phillip T. Slattery
