I heard a wonderful story last night praising Hillary Clinton for her work on behalf of children.

Last night I met Don Graves, he runs the Independent Living Skills Program (ILSP) in Contra Costa
County. The program helps children in the foster care system, and among other things, teaches them
skills needed to live on their own as adults.

Don told a heart-warming story of how then First Lady Hillary Clinton came out to visit with the kids in the
program and hear their concerns. A major concern was that resources for kids coming out of foster care
ended at age 18 and 6 months -- they needed more help. Within two years of the visit, President Clinton
signed the Foster Care Independence Act, providing more money and more resources for ages 18 - 21. I
think it is widely accepted that Hillary championed this legislation, and this was surely echoed by Don. He
was beaming with admiration for her and what she accomplished to help the kids.

He went on to say that one of the participants in the program, Alfred Perez, who was part of the original
discussion with the First Lady, was invited to the White House to see the bill signed. Alfred Perez later
served on the Pew Commission on Foster care and is now teaching at the University of
Chicago. http://www.ssa.uchicaoo.edu/facultv/ptlect/Derez-a.shtml
