Cheryl,

See Bill's response below. If he, you, the Secretary, and others are comfortable, I certainly am comfortable proceeding.

Cheryl,

I have one additional thought since we spoke, which I am mentioning to the other addressees.




                                                             I'd welcome Bill's reaction on that, as well as that of the other
addressees.

Jim:

Bob and I spoke today and he has graciously agreed to assume the sanctions portfolios for NK and Iran, in addition to his
existing responsibilities.

I know we all want to ensure a smooth transition — I think it might make sense for you Bob to meet with both Phil and
then with Steve and determine a timeline and process and then to brief you and me on that transition.

If that makes sense, I would encourage Bob to meet with Phil and with Steve. We then can determine once there is a
recommendation for how to proceed how to make that information public.

Best.
