Just talked to Holbrooke on the slopes of Telluride.



Karzai is preparing to announce his intention to proceed with the election on schedule. He has lined up Qanooni in
support.




SRAP is preparing a memo of potential options for how to move forward on this. When we have the memo I will be sure
to get it to you pronto.

If Paul has anything to add/amend, I will be sure to let you know.

Subject: Karzai call?

What, if anything, was decided about whether I should call him? The email traffic I read has Holbrooke saying "yes" and
Frank R disagreeing. Can you update pls.
