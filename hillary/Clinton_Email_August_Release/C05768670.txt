CAIRO (AP) - Arab nations have given the Palestinians the green light to enter indirect peace talks with Israel for a
preliminary four-month period. The decision from Arab foreign ministers likely opens the way for the start of long-
stalled US-brokered negotiations. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas signaled this week that he would be willing to
resume negotiations. Secretary Clinton said April 30 the talks would start next week.
