It's worth you checking in with him before the meeting. His quick report of meeting with Allawi:

    1. Allawi said he pulled back from striking a deal with ISCI because he is concerned that the Shia representation is
       too small and there is too much difficulty in trying to widen
    2. Allawi asked bill if he thought Maliki was serious, suggesting that he was toying with the idea of a grand coalition
    3. Allawi will see Barzani on the 11th

Bill's overall take is that Allawi might now be looking to test the wider coalition proposition and is not as interested in
the ISCI gambit as first option.

Bill has also seen AI-Mahdi Talabani and Zebari. He said there would be a good meeting with Maliki he's obviously
feeling confident, but was firm on limiting role of Sadrists and need to bring Iraqiyya into inclusive govt.
