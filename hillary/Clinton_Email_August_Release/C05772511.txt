Subject: (AP) Hamas says group's lawmaker arrested in West Bank

HEBRON (AP) - The Palestinian militant Hamas group says Israeli soldiers have arrested one of its lawmakers in the West
Bank.
  A Hamas official said Hathem Qufishe was arrested early October 18 at his home in the city of Hebron. The official,
Mushir al-Masri, said Israel is trying to "quash the legitimate representatives" of the Palestinian people.
  The Israeli military had no comment on the arrest.
  Qufishe was recently released from an Israeli prison after more than three years. He was among dozens of Hamas
officials arrested after Hamas-affiliated militants captured Israeli soldier Sgt. Gilad Schalit in June 2006.
