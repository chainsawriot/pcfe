Subject: Turkey-Azerbaijan Agreement signed

Hi Jake- You might let S know that the Turkey-Azerbaijan Agreement was signed today by the Ministers in the presence
of Aliyev and Erdogan. I spent last week in Baku. During the week I met for an hour and a half with Aliyev on the
agreement and a 45 minute one-on-one on our overall issues. I felt a bit like Dr. Phil. I told him what a big deal the FSN
issue was and how important it was to get resolved. I will forward on the high side an e-mail describing the meeting. This
was all fully coordinated with Phil Gordon. On the gas agreement, I am sending congratulatory letters to Aliyev and
Erdogan, both of whom I have worked with directly on these issues. If you think it a good idea for S to send letters, I can
send you drafts. Thanks...Dick
