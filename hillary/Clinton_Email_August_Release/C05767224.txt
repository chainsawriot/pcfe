Happy New Year to you, too! I'm sorry for the delay in getting back to you.

On menu: As a start, I can make a list of the lunches that he's made so far. Jason is given money advances. I'm not
positive of the total for last year since I came in April but I can have that answer for you by morning. I have skim milk for
you.

On the Human Rights Watch Report: I found it online and will print. It is 96 pages so I can put this in a binder if you'd like.



Parks and Recreation: NBC Thursdays at 8:30pm The Good Wife: CBS Tuesdays at lOpm

And it is a huge honor to work for you. I learn so much every day and I am so grateful for this unforgettable experience.
Thank you!

Monica--I hope you had a wonderful holiday season and thank you for all of your help this past year. You've been a life
saver. I'm looking forward to 2010 being even better.

Here are a few things as we start the year--

I'd like to work w you to prepare a menu for Jason. Also does he give me a monthly bill for the food he buys and
prepares for me?
Could you or he buy skim milk for me to have for my tea? Also, pls remind me to bring more tea cups from home.

Also, pls try to get me a copy of the Human Rights Watch report titled "We Have the Promises of the World: Women's
Rights in Afghanistan."

Can you give me times for two TV shows: Parks and Recreation and The Good Wife?
