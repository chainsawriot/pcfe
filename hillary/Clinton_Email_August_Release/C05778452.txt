Richard Holbrooke, Pakistan's hero:
He had a vision for our future
New York Daily News.

â€¢No American has tried as hard to ease the fears, apprehensions, doubts, conspiracy theories and ill-informed views of
 Pakistanis toward the U.S. <http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/United+States> as has Richard Holbrooke
 <http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Richard+Holbrooke >. His death is a tragedy for American diplomacy - but much
 more so for Pakistan <http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Pakistan>, because whether you liked him or disliked him,
 there is no denying that in the last two years, he constantly battled for Pakistan.

 The image of Holbrooke wading through floodwater, distributing relief goods to this year's 20 million flood victims - not
 once but repeatedly at the ripe age of 69 - is an indelible one, that our own much younger leaders barely ever
 replicated. He pushed for U.S. helicopters to be deployed in Pakistan for the flood victims. He pushed for more aid
 money for Pakistan from a reluctant Congress.

 He helped start a dialogue on a dozen different issues - which will be his lasting legacy - and he pushed Pakistan,
 especially its army, to change its ways. Under the proverbial cover of national interest, we Pakistanis never made life
 easier for him or for ourselves by confronting the new realities of terrorism, our lack of political leadership or our
 collapsing economy.

 But Holbrooke soldiered on.

At times he may have been aggressive and pushy, loud and boisterous, too quintessentially American, too bluntly New
York <http://www.nydailvnews.com/topics/New+York>.

But ultimately none of that mattered, because he bought to the table for the first time - after the preferred ignorance of
the Bush administration and its lackadaisical love affair with Gen. Pervez Musharraf
<http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Pervez+Musharraf> - a strategic vision to the U.S.-Pakistan relationship.

What was this vision? That America would remain committed to Pakistan's progress over the long term, even after the
Afghanistan <http://www.nvdaiIvnews.com/topics/Afghanistan> war was over, and that it would help improve Pakistani
relations with India <http://www.nyclailynews.comitopics/Ind ia> .

This was crucial: Unlike many who came before him and will come after, Holbrooke thought Pakistan was important for
its own sake, not just because America wanted to defeat the Taliban
<http://www.nydailynews.cornitopics/The+Taliban> in Afghanistan or solidify trade relationships with India.

He recognized the deep feelings of mistrust and ambivalence that still exist in Pakistan toward the U. S. He knew better
than anyone in the U.S. administration that diplomacy makes a difference when diplomats deal with the realities on the
ground - and not a preconceived image of what should be.

We should remember that all this time, Holbrooke battled the odds back in Washington
<http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Washington%2c+DC> . The Obama administration
<http://www.nyclailynews.comitopics/Barack+Obama> was and is heavily divided between the Obama-controlled
White House <http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/The+White+House> , the Hillary Clinton
<http://www.nydailynews.comitopics/Hillary+Clinton> -controlled State Department
<http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/U.S.+Department+of+State> - in which he was her key adviser on global issues -
and the all-powerful Pentagon. Not to speak of a Congress that, even when Democratic-controlled, kept trying to put
awkward strings on aid to Pakistan, which Holbrooke opposed.

Holbrooke was a pain in the rear end for many of these power centers. At times he was ignored by the White House or
by the Pentagon <http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/The+Pentagon> . At other times he was castigated by Congress.
But Holbrooke, a strong-willed man, stuck to his convictions.

Whoever comes after him will be far less likely to have that strength of character - call it pigheadedness, if you like - and
that will be a great loss.

It is especially problematic as Pakistan's future continues to teeter. The military still gives sanctuary to the Taliban.
Extremism is still spreading. The international community still raises fears about the safety of its nuclear weapons. As
the end game in Afghanistan approaches, some in Pakistan are pressuring against a final settlement of hostilities there.

Some in America will be happy to have a thorn removed from their sides. But many Pakistanis will remember Richard
Holbrooke fondly: He was tirelessly fighting for a more stable future for our country. We have lost a friend, and whoever
replaces him will never quite measure up.
