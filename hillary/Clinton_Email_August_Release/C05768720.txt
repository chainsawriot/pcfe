My update from this list:
Sandy Levin will be this week, working on the other Hill appointments and will get Walter I. in as soon as possible.

Staff retreat -- I don't believe we could use Blair House on the 14th but Huma will remember better than me. The 28th
is the Friday before Memorial Day weekend, not sure if people have plans that would interfere?

I will follow up on Vietnam symposium and I did call Reyes' office but never heard back so will try again tomorrow.

Here are a few odds and ends:

Since I'm going to the Bahrain Manama Conf in December, I want to decide where else I might go. The. climate conf in
Mexico will be held Nov 29-Dec 10. There is also a Dec 10 conf on trafficking in Luxor sponsored by Mrs. Mubarak that
Melanne hopes I could attend.

Add to list of meetings the following--

Ron Kirk
Hilda Solis
Walter Isaacsonâ€”high priority
Sandy Levin
Loretta Sanchez
Max Baucus
Eliot Engel

Ben Cardin wants me to come give a speech about the 35th anniversary of the Helsinki Accords on the Hill so I thought If
I'm going back to Helsinki for a speech about the Helinski Accords in July maybe I should do the Hill speech around that
time.

Also, Cheryl wants a staff retreat/meeting so what about May 14 or 28?

Did you get info about the Vietnam symposium the State historian, Carland, invited me to open on 9/29?

I want to plan to go to the Arctic Council in Greenland next April.

Did you find out when Cong Reyes's conf on border security was in August?
