Thx, Rich, but I don't think H should prepare a paper since it's not part of your official job. I'm seeing her this week so if
you can give me info to use, I will share w her. Appreciate the help.

Did some research on Saving Americas Treasures. Looks like it is funded thru interior approps. Feinstein is Senate chair
and Norm Dicks is house chair. Moran will likely take over for Dicks, as he moves to take over defense subcommittee.
Happy to weigh in with both staffs, but you are also seeing Senator Feinstein this week for dinner. We can prepare a
short paper for her staff.
