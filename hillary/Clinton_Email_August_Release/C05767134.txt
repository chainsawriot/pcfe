Hi Jake,

I just wanted to let you know that the French, Russian and US governments agreed to the attached text on the
TRR a short while ago and our Ambassadors to the IAEA are delivering it to DG Amano at this
moment.




                                                                                         I discussed with Bill,
who believes we'd get better bang out good points that the Secretary will be able to deploy in the region
during any press appearances she has in the upcoming trip. I'll take a look at the points and update
accordingly.

If you'd like to talk further, I'm available at your convenience to drop by or talk by phone â€”just let me know.
Steve
