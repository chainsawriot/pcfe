Subject: WFP-UNICEF call

Cheryl, Pat chaired the call with WFP-UNICEF-Ireland this morning, and Eleanor, Laura and I also participated from our
side. All agency reps were very supportive of merging the events, with US-Irish co-hosting. Per your email last night, we
need to work on the framing/wording around the role of WFP-UNICEF in Part II/Roundtable. Am available to discuss this
and the overall blocking whenever you have time.
Thanks! Cindy
