US major GE wins engine bid for Indian LCAs
NEW DELHI: US aircraft engine manufacturer (GE) Aviation today won the bid for supplying engines for the Indian
programme and the deal is estimated to be worth over $600 million.

GE pipped its European competitor Eurojet for the deal after DRDO, which is developing the LCA's mark II version,
formally announced that the American major's was the lowest bid in the tenders that saw a long-drawn battle for over
two years.

"GE was declared as the lowest bidder" by the Price Negotiating Committee headed by Chief Controller for Aerospace
systems Dr Prahlada.

"The Prime Negotiating Committee for the alternate engine for LCA Mk 2 has finalised the comparative statement of
tenders...After evaluation and acceptance of the technical offer provided by both Eurojet and GE Aviation, the
commercial quotes were compared in detail and GE Aviation was declared as the lowest bidder," an official statement
from DRDO said in New Delhi.

The committee also had representatives from Defence Ministry, Defence Finance, Aeronautical Development Agency,
DRDO, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, Indian Air Force and Indian Navy.

"Further price negotiations and contract finalisation will follow," the release added.

Though the order could be for 99 engines initially, will have the option of order for another 100 engines in the future.

GE had offered its GE F-414 engine as an alternative to its GE F-404 engines that are fitted in the first batch of LCAs that
IAF would receive in a couple of years from now.

Eurojet had offered its EJ-200 engines for the LCA Mk II aircraft that is under development now.
