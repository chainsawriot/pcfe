Dear Cheryl,
You rock! Your participation today was fantastic. Engaging, funny and good take away advice for everyone. It's a honor
to work here for Secretary Clinton and you. Thank you for supporting our efforts so heartily. What you said today about
Capricia is spot on..she is an amazing mentor and guiding force.

When she came up with the idea for the lunch, she said she wanted everyone to walk away feeling like that was time
well spent. She achieved that and more.

I'm thrilled to be a part of it all.
Thanks again!
Xo Lee
