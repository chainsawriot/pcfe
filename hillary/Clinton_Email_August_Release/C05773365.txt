Subject: US-EU statement on human rights in Iran




The EU has agreed to issue the joint statement on human rights situation in Iran with support of all 27 member states.
Text they approved is below. They will issue as European Union. Can we issue as "The USG" or "the United States"?

members of those detained and the continuing denial to its citizens of the right to peaceful expression are contrary to
human rights norms.




Our concerns are based on our commitment to universal respect for human rights. We are particularly concerned by the
potential for further violence and repression during the coming days, especially around the anniversary of the Islamic
Republic's founding on 11 February. We call on the Government of Iran to live up to its international human rights
obligations, to end its abuses against its own people, to hold accountable those who have committed the abuses and to
release those who are exercising their rights.
