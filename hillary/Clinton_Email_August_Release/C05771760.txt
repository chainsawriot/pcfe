Hope you are having a (relatively) quiet day with the family.

I'm taking a break from peeling potatoes to report the following:

I've circulated a call sheet for your conversation with Bibi to the group and asked them to look at it tomorrow morning
(no need to make them do it today) so that we can have a consensus recommendation for how you should approach the
call. The idea would be to send you the call sheet around noon tomorrow in time for an afternoon call, if you have the
time.
