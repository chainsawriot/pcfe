Subject                          Need to talk tonight, if at all possible



Hillary,

I would like to share the outcome of the meeting I had with Netanyahu today. I need some guidance from you urgently
and before I talk to SG (at Netanyahu's short fuse request).

I am reachable through Ops.

Many thanks,

Susan
