-- Ambassador Patterson met with Zardari last night and urged him to continue his public engagements on the flooding
crisis. She believes he is getting the message.

-- President Zardari visited flood sites in northwestern Pakistan. He will do so again tomorrow.

   Zardari still plans to be out of Pakistan on August 18 in Sochi. We have assurances, though, that this will be a one-day
trip.
