       The Secretary's Call with Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness


  Background

  Although Sinn Fein threats of bringing down the government helped precipitate the
  crisis that led to the Hillsborough agreement, the party now finds itself seeking to
  offset an electorally-fueled battle between the DUP and UUP that threatens to do
  the same. UUP leader Sir Reg Empey is threatening to withhold his support for the
  Hillsborough Agreement vote in the assembly on March 9, citing complaints about
  the functioning of the Executive and demanding movement on educational reform.
  Sinn Fein and the DUP are currently mulling his demands, and Sinn Fein might be
  willing to offer talks on the post-primary education sector (as it did two years ago,
  according to McGuinness) as a face-saving measure for Empey. This may be too
  little for Empey. Even though a UUP "yes" is not required for the cross-
  community vote to pass, First Minister Peter Robinson has said that Empey's
  support is an essential component of "community confidence" in the deal, and that
  a "no" vote by the UUP on March 9 would prompt him to resign as First Minister,
  force new elections to seek a unionist mandate for devolution. Such an outcome
  would effectively scuttle the Hillsborough Agreement and severely harm both local
  and international confidence in Northern Ireland's political institutions. Robinson
  feels strongly that the DUP would "hammer" the UUP in an Assembly election,
  while we understand that the UUP has done polling which would indicate
  significant gains for them against a scandal-ridden and weakened DUP.
  McGuinness feels both parties are badly miscalculating.

  Sinn Fein and the DUP have met with Empey repeatedly in recent days to discuss
  ways forward, although no agreement has yet been reached. McGuinness has told
  us that regardless of Empey's behavior, Robinson still holds the key to the March 9
  outcome and should come under the most pressure to allow the vote to go to the
  floor, with or without UUP concurrence. Having all patties except the UUP vote
  in favor of devolution will leave Empey and the UUP isolated, and Sinn Fein is
  trying to convince its DUP partner in government of such.
