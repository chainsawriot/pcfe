Some cats and dogs:



   1.      Talked to Denis about EU summit issue and Saakashvili. He said he would work both of them.

   2. Hikers meeting was interesting and will fill you in Monday. Bottom line — we are actively working a number of
      the options, including the British option.

   3. Saw Kurt this evening to discuss a potential Asia speech in Hawaii and he was focused on Jim again. I know you
      spoke with him and assume he gave you the same analysis.

   4. Sent you updates on Libya — it played as we expected...a demand for a complete settlement freeze including
      •Jerusalem. Our press line will be to gloss over that and focus on the top line: We have Arab support for efforts
       to create conditions to continue the negotiations .... i.e., no collapse. You will receive tomorrow morning two
       Plan B documents, one from the Mitchell team and one from Dennis Ross.

Will continue to report this weekend.
