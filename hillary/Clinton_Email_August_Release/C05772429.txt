NICOSIA (Reuters) - Russia plans to pay Iran about $800 million to compensate for its failure to deliver S-300 missile
systems, the head of state-controlled conglomerate Russian Technologies Sergei Chemezov said. Russian President
Medvedev outlawed the delivery of the high-precision missiles to Iran last month, saying that sending them would
violate sanctions adopted by the UN Security Council in June.
