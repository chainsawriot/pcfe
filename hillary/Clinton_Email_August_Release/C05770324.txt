Subject: Updates on Baker and Kissinger

Good afternoon Ellen,

I wanted to give you the latest on the New START briefings for Baker and Kissinger.

Baker: I've arranged for a phone briefing for Baker with Gary Samore, Jim Miller, Mike Elliott, and Tom DAgostino
tomorrow at 11:30 am. The briefing with last 30 minutes and they are prepared to answer any questions he has. Baker is
fairly familiar with the main issues, having already spoken with John Kerry and others.

Kissinger: I secured a 45 minute briefing for Kissinger on the 19th (next Wednesday) from 2:30 to 3:15. If you agree, you
can host it here in your office.

Let me know if you have any questions,

Simon
