Agreed--full speed ahead. But, I think we may also need a more aggressive strategy of pushing our message. Can you call
me at home thru OPs? Thx.

Not sure - but this is a good excuse to bring him in for an OTR with you. Lona mentioned you wanted to see Tom
Friedman - with your ok, we could schedule both (separately) over the next month or so

I'd very much like to get back in the habit of bringing someone or a small group in every few weeks.

Took a shot at me in his column today. Any ideas what prompted it?
