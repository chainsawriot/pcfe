JERUSALEM (AP) - Speaking to Israeli Channel 10 TV December 27, Benjamin Netanyahu said if
negotiations stall over Jerusalem or Palestinian refugees, "it could be that the result will then be an interim
agreement." On December 26 Israel's hard-line Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman floated the same proposal.
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the interim agreement idea is "a nonstarter and will not fly."
