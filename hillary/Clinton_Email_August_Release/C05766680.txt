Just tried emailing you but not sure it went through --

Missed Shaun, but talked to his COS a short while ago. She said there are still a few details to be worked out Monday.
She "wouldn't put a full stop on it," though things are looking very good. Tomorrow will be a down day and they'll
reconvene Monday to bang out last details and (hopefully) announce.

I'll be in touch with other people in the morning and give you there reports.

Will also check in with DecIan!

Shaun has just called meâ€”about 9 p.m. EST. He says it is very likely that an agreement will be announced on Monday.
The parties have reached agreement tonight. Shaun will call you on Sunday to brief. Gordon will fly into Belfast on
Monday for a ceremony if all goes according to plan now. He will mention your role. You should be prepared to speak to
the parties before the event and issue a statement. Hope it doesn't come unraveled over the next 36 hours.
