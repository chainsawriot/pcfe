Attached is the ppt that AMS will give tomorrow at the A/S meeting. It likely will take most of the time to go
thorough.

We are not handing out copies until others who are editing it have had the chance to go through it carefully.

If you have the chance, take a look through and make sure nothing is too problematic for flashing on the
screen, recognizing the goal is by the end of the day, to have a version that can be handed out on Weds to the
Hill and internally.
