Thanks Cheryl

I am now at my desk. I agree with concerns below. The cementing of the monopoly by Preval for the public container
port is a prime example how elite capture runs directly counter to job creation and social welfare.

Assets (land, heavy equipment, cement, petroleum) that are in high demand during a construction boom are in the
hands of a few. The risk is that price spikes will severely drive out the potential gains from aid dollars. Dual signatures
and injecting foreign experts into a HRA task force to review projects for eligibility will counteract obvious forms of
corruption.

The much harder task is to determine realistic benchmarks for project costs, given transfer pricing and de facto
cartels. Injecting competition and open bidding is needed to counteract this. The problem is that any Haitian firm will
loose business to US or Chinese contractors with much more favorable pricing structures (but limited spillovers to local
economy). A middle ground may be to invite joint ventures between Haitian and international companies to build up the
local workforce and overall skill base.

Best, JL

       Enforced transparency will countermand it.

       I thought Collier's earlier idea of an Independent Service Authority was interesting as long as it was
       transitional (toward a strengthened GOH) and had GOH authority from the get go.

       I like your idea. At this point a reconstruction authority with Bellerive at its head makes sense. I like
       your idea of a donor's coordination mechanism that I saw in your policy review powerpoint, with
       coordination on 'our' side under the UN Special Envoy mechanism.

       Maybe within the authority, there can be a private sector sub-group coordinated and monitored by the
       larger authority? This sub-group might also include non-Haitians, including Dominicans.

       Haiti's private sector will be less interested in decentralized investment, I think, especially if it focuses on

intensive labor and providing dignity and liveable wages to Haiti's people. This is a public works/public
sector initiative, in conjunction with international public sector organizations.

Sachs idea of the decentralized growth poles is also interesting - perhaps a way to mobilize decentralized
investment.
