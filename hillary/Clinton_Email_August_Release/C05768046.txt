Subject                            Press points


Gibbs and Pi will/have deployed these:

   •    Some of the comments made yesterday by President Karzai are troubling and a cause for real concern.

    •   Together with our international partners, the United States is making great sacrifices and investing substantial
        resources to defeat al Qaeda and its extremist allies, and to create opportunities for the Afghan people. As
        President Obama has said, we have vital security interests in the region, and we are committed to helping
        Afghanistan become strong, stable and prosperous.

    •     We would reiterate the commitments that both Presidents made during their visit last weekend. We are
          discussing this with President Karzai and his Administration and we are seeking clarification of his remarks.
