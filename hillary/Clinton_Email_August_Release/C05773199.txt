Statement from Cecile Richards on International

Family Planning in the Obama Administration Budget




WASHINGTON, DC —The women of the world have true friends in Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and the
Obama administration. After years of inadequate funding during the previous administration, yesterday's Fiscal Year
2011 budget request for an increase in international family planning is a critical step forward in demonstrating our
nation's renewed commitment to ensuring that women worldwide have access to safe and effective reproductive health
care.




The Obama administration has sent a strong signal that the status quo is unacceptable. Every year more than half a
million women — nearly all of whom live in developing countries — die of pregnancy-related causes. Moreover, one in
three deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth could be avoided if women who wanted effective contraception had
access to it.




To strengthen our working relationships with partners around the world, as well as our image, the United States must
increase access to family planning. By ensuring that women have increased access to the family planning they need, our
nation is working to make good on its commitment to promote the health of all women and their families.




An investment in family planning is an investment that reaps significant dividends. By providing education, counseling
and contraceptives to women and couples, we are working to strengthen families worldwide. We also will help achieve
major reductions in infant and maternal mortality, HIV infections and global poverty. As Secretary Clinton has said,
"There's a direct connection between a woman's ability to plan her family, space her pregnancies, and give birth safely,
and her ability to get an education, work outside the home, support her family, and participate fully in the life of her
cornmunity."




Planned Parenthood works with partners across the globe to eliminate barriers to basic reproductive health care that is
essential to the health and well-being of women, men and children everywhere. Limited access to health care, lack of
political will, legal and regulatory restrictions, cultural taboos, and harsh gender inequality all put women at risk of
unintended pregnancy, unsafe abortion and childbirth, and HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. The

commitment of Secretary Clinton and the Obama administration to international family planning will further the efforts
of Planned Parenthood and others to help women overcome barriers to accessing needed reproductive health care.




As the Fiscal Year 2011 budget and appropriations process moves forward, we look forward to working with Congress to
build on this request so that we may adequately address the global health challenges facing women worldwide.
