ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) â€” The United Nations rejected calls by south Sudan to send peacekeepers and set up a buffer
zone along the country's tense north-south border ahead of a southern vote on independence next year. "There will not
be UN peacekeepers on the buffer zone, it's unrealistic," Alain le Roy, UN Undersecretary-General for Peacekeeping
Operations, told journalists shortly after concluding a meeting with representatives from the African Union and several
other countries in the Ethiopian capital. "The common borderline is too wide and (it) is not realistic to deploy troops,"
he added.
