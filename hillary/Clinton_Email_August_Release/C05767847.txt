Thanks for the note. Would love to follow up on Pakistan and also have another idea I'd like to talk to you about. By copy
of this email I am asking Jenn Golden from my office to find a time to meet. Hope to see you soon.

Judith:

I hope you've been well. Following up on the Secretary's request, when would you like to regroup about
communications support in Pakistan?

As food for thought, I've been talking with                                    She's a great source of insight and
information on the ground, with a valuable independent perspective. She is very tuned into the government's
cornmunications challenges and opportunities.

In her view, while the need is more urgent than ever, the government does have positive programs and policies that
would generate good will if people knew about them. Communications seems to suffer both from a lack of perspective -
politicians are obsessed with politics in the capital, rather than the needs of people at the grassroots - and a lack of both
practical expertise and proactive strategy. They need a plan for publicizing initiatives that benefit people, as well as
hands-on training and support to execute effectively.

This sounds very similar to the situation my team dealt with in Lebanon, where we worked with the government,
political parties and NG0s. We learned not to let a state of crisis be an obstacle to moving forward with a
communications program - they're always in crisis and, as you know, effective communications is part of the long-term
solution.

I know there may be concern about working with US consultants. One approach would be to work through NDI, which
has great contacts and credibility on the ground. That's how we did it in Lebanon.

I hope some of this is useful food for thought. You may recall that, when we met before the holidays, I showed you the
program we did in Lebanon. Would you like me to put together ideas for a program in Pakistan?

Best, Doug

Raj is off to a brilliant start and thank you for the help you provided him.

We share your assessment of Pakistan's need for a public narrative and better capacity to communicate effectively.
Judith has been working on how we improve our comm work there, and I know you were talking to the Pakistani
Ambassador about helping them. I'm copying Judith and asking that the two of you discuss what we could do given the
very difficult political landscape.

Thx for all your good counsel. We need to follow thru on the campaign for women we discussed some months back. Are
you still assisting Melanne? Let me know what I can do to hurry it along. H

Mme Secretary:

I'm glad I got to see you at Raj's swearing-in. Hope you liked the speech. Alonzo said we hit the right notes and Raj is off
to a strong start.

Of course I was kidding about "running away" from your "long list" of things you wanted to talk about with me. I'm
happy to talk anytime.

In fact, it would be good to touch base on the women's initiative and Pakistan. I've been talking with NDI's highly
regarded country director in Pakistan, who says communications is a desperate need and will definitely do some good
for the government.

Look forward to seeing you again soon. All the best, Doug
