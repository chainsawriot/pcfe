FYI only--I saw Yo Yo Ma this week and we spoke about his Silk Road Project. Three members of his company are Iranian
and he is very interested in touring in and furthering cultural engagement with Iran once the country opens up. He asked
that I pass on this message to the Secretary, explaining that if and when this kind of engagement becomes possible, he
and the Silk Road Project are ready to embrace the opportunity. Ann
