GAZA (Reuters) - Israel carried out air strikes on targets in the Gaza Strip after a rocket fired from the Palestinian
territory exploded in the city of Ashkelon, local witnesses said. Palestinians reported several explosions in Gaza City and
Israeli aircraft could be heard flying over the territory. There were no immediate reports of injuries. The Israeli military
had no immediate comment. Earlier, Palestinian militants in Gaza fired a rocket into Ashkelon on Israel's Mediterranean
coast, causing damage but no injuries.
