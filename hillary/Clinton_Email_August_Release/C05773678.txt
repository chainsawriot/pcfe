Dear Cheryl:

As you know, a small group of us met with the Secretary and Bill Burns on Tuesday morning on Iran. We would like her
to have both the attached letter of thanks and a paper which provides fuller detail on the ideas we discussed with her
along with some further thoughts and suggestions in response to her statements to and questions of us.

With my thanks and good wishes for Christmas and New Years,

Sincerely, Tom Pickering
