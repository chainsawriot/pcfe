TEHRAN (AP) - Syrian President Bashar Assad offered dim hopes Saturday for any success in Middle East peace talks,
saying the White House is only using its mediation between Israelis and Palestinians to score political points in the
United States. The comments by Assad during a one-day visit to Tehran followed talks with Iranian President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad. Both leaders pledged to support "resistance" in the region, an apparent reference to Palestinian militants
and others opposing Israel.
