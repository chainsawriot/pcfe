Subject                            Karzai



Ms:
I apologize if this email is duplicating anyone else's efforts (we are trying to leave huma alone today!) Jake has put forth
a recommendation for you to call karzai today, and also for you to speak with holbrooke in advance of that call. There is
an updated call sheet which has been faxed to your residence in chappaqua, and should be there now.
Let me know if I can help in any other way.
