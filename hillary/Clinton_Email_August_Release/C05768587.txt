As you will note from Larry's message below, we are dealing with a another "situation' in Islamabad. I have asked Larry
to work with his team to be sure our response gets as broad coverage as possible in Pakistan and on-line so our reaction
is picked up by googlers. As you know, although our immediate reaction may be to just blow this stuff off we ignore it at
our peril since it seems there are large segments of the population who actually believe this stuff. I also want to be sure
we get it out to the diaspora community here and elsewhere. Thoughts ?

Subject: Mission Corrections: Bhutto Assassination



Under Secretary McHale:

This week we have seen the most extraordinary series of public attacks on the United States by Lt Gen (ret) Hamid Gul, a
noted anti-American crackpot who derives his role as an "expert analyst" by being the only former Inter-Services
Intelligence (151) Chief who ever appears on TV. Gul was briefly ISI chief during PM Bhutto's first term in office almost 20
years ago. Appearing on several TV stations this week, Gul has repeated allegations that the U.S. is implicated in the
Bhutto Assassination —the subject is current this week because of the release of the U.N. report on the assassination,
which is itself a remarkable document.

One ironic element of the UN report on the assassination is the report that on October 16, 2007 former PM Bhutto
wrote to General Musharraf that the very same Hamid Gul was one of three people she considered a threat to
her security. (see excerpt below) This fact came up in none of the programs.


Our view is that the television journalists and executives now must begin taking responsibility for putting
inciting and unsubstantiated claims on the air. We have released the attached "Correction," which will be
seen by news editors across the country.

Excerpt from   the UN report on the Bhutto assassination:

179. On 16 October 2007, Ms Bhutto writing from Dubai to General Musharraf identified three people she
considered a threat to her security: (1) Brigadier (ret) Ejaz Shah, Director General of the IB at the time of the
