TEHRAN (Reuters) — Iran denied that border guards had detained seven U.S. troops, calling the report "unfounded", the
state-run English language Press TV said. The country's Arabic language television al-Alam also quoted Iran's
Revolutionary Guards, in charge of Iran's border security, as denying that any such incident had happened in the
southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchestan, as earlier reported by a semi-official news agency.

TEHRAN (Reuters) — Iranian border guards detained seven U.S. troops as they tried to illegally enter the Islamic state, the

Iranian guards in a southeastern province of the country ... Two Iranians accompanying the troops were also arrested,"
said Fars.
