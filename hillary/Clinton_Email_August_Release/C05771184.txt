Subject: MidEast talks

To Secretary Clinton: I'm very grateful for your kind reception yesterday.

        My hope is that progress can now be made in the Middle East, Korea, Sudan, and Cuba, and we are eager to help
if you call on us. For instance, we have an enormous group of religious leaders with whom we have been working, which
includes prominent Mainline Protestants, Catholics, Evangelicals, African-Americans and Hispanics from across the
theological and political spectrum. They can issue public statements, OpEds, etc. to support your efforts with the Israelis
and Palestinians. Just have one of your staff members let me know at any time. Also, The Elders are eager for our efforts
to be constructive. Our prayers and hopes are with you. Jimmy
