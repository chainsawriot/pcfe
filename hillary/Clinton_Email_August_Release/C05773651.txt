BETHLEHEM (Reuters) - A Palestinian Authority draft resolution condemning Israel's West Bank settlement
activity is ready to be presented to the UNSC, a senior Palestinian Authority official said. Saeb Erekat, the chief
Palestinian Authority negotiator in peace talks with Israel, said he expected the resolution would be put to a
UNSC vote in February, after the United States ends its presidency of the council. "We are not condemning
Israel. We are condemning settlement activities and we hope the resolution will pass," Erekat said. He said 15
nations had helped draft the proposal after Palestinian Authority President Abbas requested a UNSC meeting to
discuss settlement building in November. "Something must be done on the international level to halt the
settlement expansion which the Israeli government is undertaking in the West Bank, including Jerusalem,"
Nabil Abu Rdainah, Abbas's spokesman, said at the time. As the Palestinian Authority has only observer status
at the UN, the resolution will be presented by a full member of the council. Erekat said he hoped the United
States would not use its veto to defeat the resolution and added that if it did not succeed at the UNSC, "we will
go to the International Court of Justice."
