I did not mention this because not sure how I felt about it, but if all agree it would help, I will call her.

Hi Jake,

You'll see that the Secretary's points for Ashton mention the idea of our sending an inter-agency expert team to Brussels
for the next few months to improve US-EU coordination on Iran sanctions prep. EU officials had been receptive, but
now the bureaucrats are saying this would be "counter-productive", and instead prefer more regular videoconferences.
Which is probably OK. Anyway, I just wanted you to know the background, in case it comes up in the Ashton meeting.

Steve
