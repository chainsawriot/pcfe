Dear Mr. Crowley,
   I left you a message and look             alking, but here's the short version.
   One of our Pakistani stringers,           has been the object of harrassment by the ISI, to the point where we have
flown him out of the country for his own safety. Both                                   have heard from Pakistani contacts
that the ISI was "looking for"     Both     wife and                     a colleague in our Islamabad Bureau, have had
calls from the ISI.
   I understand that the State Department's influence with ISI is limited at best, but I wanted to get this situation on the
department's radar, and urge you to take any steps you can think of to discourage this menacing treatment of an
honorable and talented journalist, so that he can return to Pakistan and his work without fear.
   Thanks.
