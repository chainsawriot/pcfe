Subject                            FW: Is there still a bottleneck at the airport? I'm listening to a doctor (Bob Hoff w
                                   Salvation Army)on NPR saying he is upset because they are running out of supplies and
                                   he keeps being told they are in the air.



Yes

While we have control of airport — the Haitians are dictating the priority of landing of planes and the document did not
get signed today b/c at meeting the issue did not get resolved (or medical supply issue).

On with Ken now — getting ready to try calling Preval with Ken
