That number—I think il has to be over $1 b. tho because people will compare it to Mitch--sounds right to me altho not only
will the destruction likely go higher than the final numbers of I believe $8.5 b. for Mitch/George but the cost of
reconstruction if the aim is modern buildings, modern systems, decentralized development is also likely to be higher.

A separate question, beyond the money are the people who can be committed, which goes to USAID ramping up its staff
and capabilities, the civilian response corps and I suspect your QDDR recommendations, on how to imagine a sector by
sector renewal with international partners on the ground able to work side-by-side with Haitians in every ministry (starting
with those that are priorities, which have to be justice [police, judiciary and prisons], education, agriculture, energy/public
works/environment, etc. in PAP but also in those department capitals where you want regional development to be
launched--Cap Haitian, Gonaives, Jacmel, Hinche, etc. If it were done as part of an international support team, under UN
coord (?), and sign-off upfront from the Haitian government, it might work.
Three last points: 1) the Crisis Corps of the Peace Corps--I know that every RPCV who served in Haiti will be desperate to
help. Many of them have professional capabilitiesiAsk Aaron to locate them.
2) As part of what announcement is made on Monday, this might be the time to add some number of US Haitian-American
Creole-speaking police to the UNPolice force, particularly those with community policing experience, say 100.
3) Finally, what about an emergency lifting of whatever restrictions (quotas, tariffs, etc.) that may still impinge on Haitian
agricultural products coming to US, an emergency provisions of phytosanitary expertise to enable their farmers to meet
our standards and remove any restrictions (which exist) on their subsidizing their rice farmers for their domestic
production.

I know that you all are working 24/7 on this so I apologize to some degree for accepting your offer to send advice. But that
probably won't stop me from sending!! Warm regards, Mark

Hi Cheryl,
Heard you yesterday on NPR. Right on the money in terms of emphasizing coop with GoH and coord with UN et. al. One
thing I am not sure that I mentioned. I looked back and relatively early--4 weeks after Mitch at end Oct 98--we made the
estimate that the US contribut would have to be about $1 b. (when early damage estimate was $6 b.) and that was the
general amount mentioned in the first formin meeting by Madeleine here in early Dec and then the supplemental went to
Congress with more of a breakdown from USAID in early Feb. As soon as you can get an early supplemental to the Hill
while the focus is on Haiti, and our forces are on the ground there, the better chances that it will receive early action. Best,
mark
