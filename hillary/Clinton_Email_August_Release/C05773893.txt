Subject: Blair statement

Blair's guy said you ok'ed releasing today. If so, we'll pull the trigger. It is pasted below:




Statement by the Secretary




This Administration has, from the beginning, worked to bring about comprehensive peace in the Middle East, including a
two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. On that issue our approach has been three-fold: (1) to help build the
economy and capacity to govern of a Palestinian state; (2) to renew political negotiations to enable the earliest possible
establishment of that state; and (3) to achieve these in a manner that ensures the security of Israel and of the
Palestinians.




Consistent with Prime Minister Fayyad's plan for a future Palestinian state, Tony Blair, as the Quartet representative, will
intensify his partnership with Senator Mitchell in support of the political negotiations. In his role as Quartet
Representative Tony Blair will continue, with full support by and coordination with Senator Mitchell, to mobilize the
efforts of the international community: (1) to build support for the institutional capacity and governance of a future
Palestinian State, including on the rule of law; (2) to improve freedom of movement and access for Palestinians; (3) to
encourage further private sector investment; and (4) to bring change in the living conditions of the people in Gaza.
