This is from Justice Stevens' dissent in the Citi2:ens United case:

If taken seriously, our colleagues' assumption that the identity of a speaker has no relevance to the i.Tjoi..narnments ability
to regulate political speech would lead to some remarkable conclusions. Such an assumption would have accorded the
propaganda broadcasts to our troops by "Tokyo Rose' during World Ver Il the same protection as speech by Allied
commanders. More pertinently, it would appear to afford the same protection to multinational corporations controlled
by foreigners as to individual Americans: To do otherwise, after all, could 'enhance the relative voice"' of some i.e. ,
humans) over others ( i.e. , nonhumans). Ante at 33 (quoting Buckley , 424 U. S., at 49). 51

Amendment <http:www.la.i.v.cornell.edu/suoct-cgliget-const?amendmenti> problem that corporations are not
permitted to vote, given that voting is, among other things, a form of speech.

F.:logging on the Citizen S United Supreme Court ruiing is mor,7, of wha,,: we love

about the web. it's the kind of typical coiLective c.liss.ectiovi we have now come

to expect but that never really existed before: serious, speculative, arcane,

funny, brilliant, baked, etc. The Sunlight Foundation blogging

<http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/01/22/wait-can-foreign-companies-now-spend-on-us-political-electionsh

is predictably good. Paul Blumenthal dips into the multinational dimension of

the new "corporation as full citizen-person" framework, drawing on blogging

going on at Newsweek <http://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/thegaggle/archive/2010/01/22/should-foreign-corporations-
spend-money-on-u-s-political-candidates.aspx>

and the Center for Public Integrity <http://www.publicintegrity.orearticlegentry/1913/>




"Looks like [the Court] might support allowing foreign companies to spend freely

in elections in the United States. I guess this would be the corporate

globalization of the U.S. electoral system." So you gotta ask yourself: Who does

Hugo Chavez want for President?

Blumenthal excerpting the Center for Public Integrity:




  <http://coloradoindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Picture-142.png>

  The Center for Public Integrity looks at this closer and shows what kind of

foreign influence we are looking at:




    One prominent examples is CITGO Petroleum Company — once the

American-born Cities Services Company, but purchased in 1990 by the Venezuelan

government-owned Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. The Citizens United ruling could

conceivably allow Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who has sharply criticized

both of the past two U.S. presidents, to spend government funds to defeat an

American political candidate, just by having CITGO buy TV ads bashing his

target.

    And it's not just Chavez. The Saudi government owns Houston's Saudi

Refining Company and half of Motiva Enterprises. Lenovo, which bought IBM's PC

assets in 2004, is partially owned by the Chinese government's Chinese Academy

of Sciences. And Singapore's APL Limited operates several U.S. port operations.

A weakening of the limit on corporate giving could mean China, Saudi Arabia,

Singapore, and any other country that owns companies that operate in the U.S.

could also have significant sway in American electioneering.




  I really can't see Americans being too happy about this.




Dahlia Lithwick reported for Slate <http://www.slate.com/id/2242208/> from the

Supreme Court as the opinions were being read. She offered this aside:




  While Stevens is reading the portion of his concurrence about the "cautious

view of corporate power" held by the framers, I see Justice Thomas chuckle

softly.




Was it a disdainful chuckle at the impotence of his colleague? Was it merely a

chuckle of disagreement, of good-natured exasperation? Was it a chuckle at an

anachronistic vision of the framers set beside today's modern corporate silicon

and steel behemoths? I doubt he was thinking about Hugo Chavez.
