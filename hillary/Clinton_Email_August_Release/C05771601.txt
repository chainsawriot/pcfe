Rich Armitage called me about speaking to the Turkish Council and, if I do, the FM Day will come. I can't remember what
we decided about this but he sounded like he hadn't gotten a response yet.
What does EUR and others think?

He also went to Af w Sandy Berger and I invited them to come see about their trip. I'd like to schedule after Labor Day.
