Subject                            Previous CTO proposal



Madam Secretary,


Jake mentioned that you asked for more information about a proposal made in 2005 for a global CT organization, and he
asked me to find out a little about it. Below is some brief information on the proposal, which was made by Saudi Arabia:

The proposal made by the then crown prince (now king) in Feb. 2005 called for the establishment of an international
counterterrorism center "under the auspices of the UN." The purpose of the organization would be to, among other
things, "develop a mechanism for exchanging information and expertise between States" on a wide range of non-
military counterterrorism issues, encourage the establishment of national and regional centers, and provide assistance
to developing countries to deal with crises and terrorist acts. The center, as conceived in 2005, would also allow national
counterterrorism coordinators from different countries and regions to meet and share information and experiences.

This proposal was endorsed by the OIC (and OIC countries reaffirm their support for the center each year at the UNGA),
but has never received any serious consideration within the UN by non-OIC members. The Saudis continue to be
interested in implementing the proposal. Most significantly, recently there have been discussions between the UN and
Saudis as to how their proposal could be married with efforts to enhance the UN's capacity to support implementation
of the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy by allowing the UN Counter-Terrorism Task Force (CTITF) Office and the
different CTITF member entities to engage more actively and directly with CT experts/practitioners in capitals and have
multilateral CT consultations wherever necessary.



                                                               But S/CT mentioned that, if we were to move forward
on S/CT's CFO idea, we would hope to work closely with the Saudis.

Please let me know if you would like any further info.

Thanks,
Mike
