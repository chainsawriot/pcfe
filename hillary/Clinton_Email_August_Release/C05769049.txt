Subject: Border Issues Update

The latest regarding border issues:

        a) Per EmbOff, border at Jimani remained disorganized but functional as in recent days.

        b) The flow of persons across the border is constant, but no mass influx. However, official figures under-report
            the numbers of people crossing, as the data reflect only those being processed correctly. Some Haitians are
            sneaking across the border, per USG official. Haitian media also report "tens of thousands" leaving Port-au-
            Prince, some for the DR border. However, police officials say they have not seen increased illegal entry
            attempts in the mountains around the Jimani crossing.

        c) A Haitian immigration official said that as of lpm on 1/19 he had issued approximately 600 laissez-passes to
            travelers without documents. Dominican authorities at the other side of the border crossing are generally
            turning away travelers without a valid visa or official travel document. Medical emergency cases continue
            being allowed in.

        d) The border crossing at Jimani was closed for 45 minutes after the Haitian colonel in charge of customs on
            the Haitian side began demanding "manifests" from vehicles trying to bring assistance across. GODR
            officials managed to talk the colonel into backing down, but plan to seek his removal. (Note: It is unclear
            whether this was an attempt at rent-seeking by the Haitian official, but some reporting implied that. End
            Note).

        e) As the next Market Day in Jimani will be Thursday, efforts are already underway to see if market activities
            that day can be organized so as not to block/hamper through-put of assistance / evacuation vehicles.
