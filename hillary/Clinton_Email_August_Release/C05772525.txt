Subject: (AP) Israeli official: Moroccan king won't meet Peres

JERUSALEM (AP) - An aide to Israel's president says the king of Morocco won't meet with the Israeli statesman because
of the impasse in Mideast peace talks.
   The aide says King Mohammed VI cited the deadlocked talks in turning down President Shimon Peres' request to meet
at an upcoming international conference in Marrakech.
   Peace talks have stalled over Israel's refusal to extend building curbs in the West Bank. The Palestinians say they won't
negotiate if Israel doesn't relent, but have given the U.S. until early November to try to resolve the dispute.
   The aide, who wasn't authorized to discuss the issue with the media and spoke on condition of anonymity, said
October 18 that if Peres can't meet with the king, he won't attend the World Economic Forum on the Middle East and
North Africa.
