FYI Below.




FYI â€” I spoke to Lady Catherine Ashton who called to 1) wish you well on this trip and express her gratefulness that you
are traveling; and 2) ask if you might be willing to call her Sunday morning to give her a read out of your trip bic she has
a briefing in Brussels and having a first hand report from you will allow her to forestall a trip to Haiti in the next week.
