Subject: (Al)) Israeli police flatten mosque, say built illegally

RAHAT (AP) â€” Israeli police said they demolished an illegally built mosque in the southern Bedouin city of Rahat, touching
off rock-throwing protests by residents. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the two-story mosque was knocked
down November 7 in keeping with a court ruling. Mosque activist Yousef Abu-Jama said residents built the structure
illegally because Israeli authorities would take too long to issue approval. Authorities rarely target mosques for demolition.
This particular mosque was financed by a group that is frequently in conflict with authorities.
