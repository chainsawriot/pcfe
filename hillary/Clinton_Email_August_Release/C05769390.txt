Subject: feedback on the internet speech


Several NSN staff went to a CAP forum with some Chinese bloggers today, and came back emotionally overwhelmed by
the bloggers' positive response to her speech. One of them apparently said the speech was like "a song to his heart"
and my hard-bitten 20-something staffer said he almost cried when the guy said it. Nice work.
