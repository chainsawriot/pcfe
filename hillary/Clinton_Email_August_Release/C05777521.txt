******************


The allegation against Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus of 'diverting foreign aid from Grameen Bank to another
company' should be investigated, the prime minister has said.
"Bangladesh has set many examples. Deceiving people by siphoning off their money is another such example. This is
nothing but sucking out money from the people after giving them loans," she said replying to questions from journalists
on Sunday.
"There has been no improvement in the lifestyle of the poor so far. They were just used as pawns to get more aids,"
Hasina added.
She was speaking at a press conference at her office on Sunday following her three-nation tour of Russia, Belgium and
Japan.
"The people of Bangladesh have been made guinea pigs. I have never supported that. And now I protest," Hasina told
journalists.
Naimul Islam Khan, editor of Amader Shomoy, said, "Initially, the government had 60 percent share of the Grameen
Bank which now has shrunk to 25 percent. It seems Mr Yunus wanted to empty the government exchequer, if he could.
The government, however, didn't let that happen."
He also asked whether the government would investigate the allegation raised against Yunus and his Grameen Bank.
Responding to the query, the prime minister said, "Grameen Bank had been grabbed in such a manner as if it's a
personal property. This should also be investigated. The poor people are becoming paupers. They have been tricked by
sweet talks. Finally, things are getting out."
Hasina compared Khaleda Zia's 'affection' for her cantonment house with Yunus' affection' for his Grameen Bank and
said, "Grameen Bank is a public property. But it's being privatised out of 'love'. Yunus Sahib has fallen in love with
Grameen Bank.

"One can't but get caught if play with the money of the poor," she added.
Norway's national TV NRK aired a documentary on November 30 titled "Fanget i Mikrogjeld" or "Caught in Micro debt",
based on which bdnews24.com ran a report on December 1.

According to the documentary, Yunus transferred the money to Grameen Kalyan, which was in no way involved with
microcredit operations.

Responding to the allegations, Grameen Bank claimed there was no wrongdoing in the agreement between the bank
and Grameen Kalyan under which it received Tk 3,917 million from the bank.
"Decisions were taken by the Grameen Bank Board, with due deliberation, good faith, and with good intentions to
benefit the poor," the Grameen Bank rejoinder said.
