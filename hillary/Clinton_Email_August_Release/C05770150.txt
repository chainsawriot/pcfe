It seems to me that Clegg feels he's weak, can't form a grand progressive coalition--the Lib Dems have LOST seats--
Clegg's so-called "modernizing" has failed. So Clegg is saying no deal with Labour, Tories must govern without acting on
their program. He's plalying for another election relatively soon, perhaps a year, hoping to do better, but will do even
worse having played the spoiler. And if Labour goes out, so does Gordon and Labour will have a new face, probably
David. Sid
