Basically if they can get their teams in from brussels tomorrow morning (a day before nato starts), its moving forward.
We should know approx 6am our time. However, if we need to be wheels up at 8am, that's too short notice. I just told
ivo we need to lean on them to make a decision sooner. Will keep u posted but we are def getting the sense they want
to move forward.

So, what's the latest? It sounds contradictory and when does AF have to decide? Shall we take the 1 or 2 shuttle?

Update on airport openings. Looks like estonia is partially open. They think most ministers will fly private so they seem
to want to try and move forward.
