           The Honorable Kent Conrad, Chairman
           Committee on the Budget
           United States Senate  •
           Washington, D.C. 20510

           Dear Mr. Chairman:

                 I am asking your help in supporting the State and,USAID budget request kw
           FY 2011. I appreciate the difficult budget environment that confronts the
           Congress, but 1 strongly believe this budget request is critical to advancing U.S.
           national security and our interests around the world.

                  Our request totals $52.8 billion — a $4.9 billion increase over 2010. 01 that
           increase, $3.6 billion goes directly to "frontline states" — Afghanistan, Pakistan,
           and Iraq. All other State and USA1D funding grows by $1.3 billion or a 2.7
           percent increase, and allows us to tackle the transnational problems of poverty,
           food insecurity, climate change, and disease that pose serious threats to American
           interests.

                  Our diplomatic and development tools enhance American leadership.
           strengthen our alliances, and build new partnerships to confront pressing global
           challenges. Full funding in FY 11 will allow us to continue making tangible
           progress in securing the hard fought gains achieved in Iraq, and to continue
           supporting and deploying hundreds of civilians in Afghanistan and Pak iS UM to help
           stabilize dangerous but improving situations.

                 The recent attacks on United States,personnel and facilities from Juarez.
           Mexico, to Peshawar, Pakistan, reinforce what We already know — America's
           diplomats and development professionals are on the front lines, protecting. and
           securing our vital national security interests around the world.

                  Congress has rightly demanded that we use all the tools in our national
           security tool belt; that we put more diplomats and development experts on the
           ground, shoulder-to-shoulder with our troops; and that we do everything possible
           to secure America's interests around the world. We are doing our part at the State
           Department and USA1D, but we need your help with the FY II request. Our
