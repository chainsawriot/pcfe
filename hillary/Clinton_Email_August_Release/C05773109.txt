DEAUVILLE (Reuters) - Russia wants to take part in a NATO-backed missile defense shield and will go to next month's
NATO summit, softening its stance after reassurances from France and Germany, a source close to participants said on
October 19.

  Security is a major stumbling block in Russia's relationship with the West and has dominated talks between Presidents
Sarkozy and Medvedev and Chancellor Merkel in the northern French seaside town of Deauville.

   The source said that Medvedev himself would attend the NATO summit, which is due to unveil a new strategic plan
for the 28-country alliance on November 19-20 in Lisbon.
