Jim Mann, who wrote The Rise of the Vulcans, is writing a history of Democrats and foreign policy since Vietnam. He's
also a China expert, having covered China for the LA Times. He's favorably disposed to you, a serious person and
concerned about the policies. I know him well. I think you ought to consider talking to him on the record for his book. I've
enclosed his bio from Johns Hopkins SAIS , where he's on the faculty, and his email.

Sid,




     My requests for a book interview with the secretary

of state are still going nowhere. I have no idea whether


the reason is sheer bureaucracy (lots of requests)


or personal (someone didn't like something I wrote?).


I would think that the subject matter -- foreign policy


after the Vulcans -- is a natural one for her.




    While it's not absolutely necessary,


it would certainly add insight. I don't know


if you can do anything to help, but if so,


I'd certainly appreciate it.




                         Best,




                                 Jim
