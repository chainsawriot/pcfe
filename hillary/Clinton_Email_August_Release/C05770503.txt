Vail felt that Anne's assessment of the new Pakistani submission was too negative. He believes it is their opening
position - that it is quite sophisticated - and that it represents a real step forward from their initial 56-page list of
demands.

He acknowledges that it is lighter on the things we care about, but notes for example that productive items like the
strategic dialogue get far more space than unproductive items like civ-nuke.

He very much agrees with your concept of annotating the document.
