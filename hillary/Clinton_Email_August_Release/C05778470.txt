Madam Secretary,

The outpouring of condolences from the international community and the Afghans for Richard's passing has been
extraordinary. We have had a steady flow of visitors from the NATO and diplomatic community and, most importantly,
Afghans of every walk of life for several days who have come to sign the condolence book.

Today, during my weekly meeting with President Karzai, I took along the condolence book to be signed at the
Palace. President Karzai signed and wrote a nice tribute to Richard and graciously allowed us to bring an Embassy
photographer to memorialize the occasion. A photograph is attached. We will separately arrange for a copy to be
signed by President Karzai for Kati.

Separately, I would ask that you thank Mike Mullen for permitting the USO show with which he is traveling to stage an
unprecedented performance at the U.S. Embassy today. Allowing Embassy Kabul to be the site of a USO show in
Afghanistan was very gracious of Mike as normally USO shows are only held at military bases. We had an extraordinary
turnout of our civilian and military team from all over Kabul gathered today to see Robin Williams and other
entertainers. Mike remains a real champion of our civil-military cooperation and teamwork.

Respectfully,

Karl

SBU
