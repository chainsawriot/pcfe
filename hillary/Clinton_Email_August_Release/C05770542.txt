Subject: (Reuters) Clinton raises concern over Vietnam's rights record

HANOI - Secretary Clinton expressed concern over Vietnam's arrests of dissidents, attacks on religious groups and curbs
on Internet freedom, but said the countries remained friends. The United States and Communist-run Vietnam marked
15 years of diplomatic ties this month and Clinton said the two countries had "learned to see each other not as former
enemies but as actual and potential partners, colleagues and friends. We have consistently moved in the direction of
engagement and cooperation, even on those issues where we disagree." Clinton spoke during a two-day visit to Hanoi
for the Asia-Pacific region's biggest security dialogue.
