H: Pat Lang's view of the resumed talks. Sid


."IsraePaestinialpeace talks expected to resume in Se4zitember" Washst

 "The Middle East peace process resumed in May, after a hiatus of 19 months, but it stalled
again over the terms of moving from indirect talks, mediated by U.S. envoy George Mitchell,
to direct negotiations.
.israel insists it is ready for direct talks, provided there are no preconditions. The Palestinians
are ready provided there is a clear agenda. Israel says an agenda means preconditions.
Resolving the snag over terms is crucial, diplomats say." Washpost

The former NY Times reporter Judy Miller likes to address me as "gloomy gus" or some such
thing when I encounter her. Well, stand by for some more gloom.
The second Camp David talks failed because Dennis Ross and company placed the
Palestinian delegation in a position in which a "solution" was demanded and expected by the
Americans and Israelis on the basis of bargaining during the negotiations themselves.
This seemed reasonable at the time to the US and Israeli negotiators. After all, is this not
what one does? Should not the outcome be the product of the dialectic of argument and
persuasion?
Arabs generally think not. They tend to believe that negotiations are for the purpose of of
arranging the details of outcomes that are understood in advance of the conference itself. For
them, anything else is an attempt to win concessions through trickery.
"The Palestinians are ready provided there is a clear agenda. Israel says an agenda means
preconditions."
Hello! What kind of nonsense is this? Have we learned nothing?
And then, there is the "little" matter of the non-participation of Hamas. Does the Obama
Administration really think that this 600 pound gorilla can be ignored? Is this some sort of
scheme on the part of Natanyahu, and "the boys" to discredit Abbas so that an isolated
Hamas can be attacked and destroyed later?
Realism in diplomacy is a desirable thing. George Mitchell used to be smarter than this. His
staff should be advising him not to do this. Failure will be catastrophic.
All the players should be engaged, and they are not. The outcome should be known in
advance and it is not.
This is both childish and destructive. pl
