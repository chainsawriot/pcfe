Thanks, Cheryl We know we can count on your support. We'll talk in the morning. We're very concerned over our
injured officers and moving heaven and hell to get to them.
                                                  The UN was hit MUCH worse than us. No work on
         The UN is flying in medevacs early and hopes to start ferrying its injured and dead from the headquarters to the
airport where they are setting up a temporary hospital/morgue. The city is chaotic with traffic jams, rubble, and lots of
dead bodies. No reports yet of violence, but looting has begun. MINUSTAH is focused totally on trying to rescue people
from their crumbled headquarters. The Canadian Embassy was severely damaged. We are getting HUGE aftershocks
every 20-30 minutes that bring down more rubble and are rattling everyone's nerves. I'll be working on a list tonight for
ordered departure and hope to have a recommendation for the Department at 7:30. Thanks for your support! David

Cheryl,
   We'll look into it. I'm told a lot of people are taking refuge at the Karibe, leading me to hope it might be in better
shape. I'll let you know anything I hear. David
