Secretary Clinton and Huma!

Hope you're both well. The DVD screener should arrive at Huma's sometime this morning.

I can't wait for to hear what you think of the film and, if you have the time, how we can strengthen themes and sections
to make it a more relevant and effective educational and policy influencing tool. We are currently at various stages of
reaching out or building partnerships with a wide variety of organizations from Facing History and Ourselves to JStreet to
the Marine Corps to the United Nations
(informally) to various think tanks, and human rights organizations.
We have big plans for the film and hope to use it as a platform to foster critical cross-cultural conversations.

And a disclaimer- the film is still a work in progress. We are drastically changing the intro, moving some sections around,
and adding a story about the Marines sending senior Marine Officers to Jordan to negotiate and build partnerships with
Al Anbar's exiled tribal leaders.

I am so excited for you to see it.

Have a safe trip, I hope to see you soon, and all the best,

Love,

Zach
