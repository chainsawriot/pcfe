It's a very New York crowd and very Diane style event (i.e. unconventional) Last year, it was held in one of the big
delegates' lounges at the UN and she redid all the chairs, etc in her patterns. The awards are all serious and DVF is the
moderator. Each awardee receives 50K for her ongoing work. The event bears no resemblance to a typical foreign policy
event, but if you were in NY, you could arrive for the awards and leave. I have no doubt you would be very warmly
embraced and DVF and Barry are so fond of you. I would only do it if could be easily done.

   Dearest Madame Secretary,

   more and more impressive...I am so proud of you !
   We are planning our Women of the World Conference again for next March. On Saturday night, March 12th, I will
   be having the 2nd DVF Award at a dinner at the UN. 2 of the recipients vvill be women from Vital Voices, one will
   be voted by people on line and the fourth one is the speciai one give to formidable example of courage and
' leadership. Last year it was given to Ingrid Betancourt by Meryll Streep,
   More than anything, I would love if you would be willing to accept that award. YOU are such an example of
   strength. leadership and spirit to all of us women.
   Am I dreaming or would you be willing to accept it ?
   Lots of love
