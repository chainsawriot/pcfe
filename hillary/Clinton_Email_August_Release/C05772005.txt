Let me try this again.

Robert Pape is a top strategic thinker from U of Chicago who is best known for his empirical work showing a strong
correlation between suicide terrorism and occupation by foreign troops. In his new work he is proposing a grand
strategy of off-shore/on-shore balancing. Below is the elevator version, or at least an academic's version of the elevator
version. What is interesting is how closely it tracks with our emphasis on civilian power and the need for a smaller
military due to budget constraints. If you want more the attached one-page proposal outlines a 3-year series of steps to
apply this proposal to Afghanistan.

"An Alternative Security Strategy. Off-shore/on-shore balancing seeks to achieve America's core national security
objectives through a combination of over-the-horizon ("off-shore") military power and in-region ("on-shore") economic
and political power. Off-shore/on-shore balancing is an alternative to advancing U.S. security goals through the
deployment of large ground forces overseas, already problematic and likely to become even more so as economic
challenges continue and chronic resentment deepens. Off-shore/on-shore balancing relies on naval, air, and rapidly
deployable ground forces in combination with on-site economic and political support for local partners to secure
America's interests in combating terrorism and achieving other key national security goals, particularly in the Middle
East and Asia."

Dear Anne-Marie,




As we discussed during your salon dinner with Steve Clemons at Nora's, I am developing a practical strategy of "off-
shore/on-shore balancing" that would involve key USG agencies.




As the attached proposal explains, the new strategy is substantially different from previous historical constructs in the
literature on American grand strategy and offers important advantages to improve our position in Afghanistan and other
regions in the world in the coming years.




Going forward, I would like make sure I have State's views correct. If you and your staff could meet with me later next
week, this would greatly help.




I look forward to further discussion.

Bob
