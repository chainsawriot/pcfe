Erica flagged for me, and Bill Burns just called to confirm, that Mottaki has asked the perm reps of the Security Council
to have dinner tomorrow night.

Susan can't attend because she's here in DC, but proposes Alex Wolff attend in her place.




You can discuss with Bill and Jim in the am, but wanted to flag.
