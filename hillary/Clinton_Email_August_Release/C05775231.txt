This is just for you because I wouldn't want anyone to think this is motivated by a desire to curry favor with my boss.

I know you're already fully aware, but with the shortened congressional work session coming to an end this evening, I
thought it was worth repeating -- we're really lucky to have Rich. He seemingly willed the latest set of legislative
accomplishments. In particular, the two defense treaties and the child support treaty never would have gotten across
the finish line without his leadership.
