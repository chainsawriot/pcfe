A quick summary from Ibrahim; these comments were made prior to the FoLLow-Up Cty meeting,
which is now underway. -rw

In press statements this evening, NAR stressed that the PA and the PLO are committed to the
Arab position which will be developed in the meeting of the Arab Follow Up committee in
Cairo. In response to a question at the beginning of the meeting on President Abbas's
presentation to the committee, NAR said that the ideas that will be presented are not those
of President Abu Mazen but basically are about the US responses to the Palestinian questions
in relation to the role of Senator Mitchell in the 'proximity talks.    He will also stress
that the Palestinian position will be the same as the Arab position.

He added that these ideas will be presented to the to the Arab Follow Up committee and we
shall see what the Arabs will say. And we will adhere to the Arab position completely
exactly as we did when we went to Annapolis and to Madrid peace conference. He said the
answer will be provided in the meeting. He went on to say that we have received some
responses from Washington to questions which President Abbas had raised. In response to a
question on whether the US answers constitute an appropriate ground to resume negotiations,
NAR said that the US wants to move the peace process forward and want to create a conducive
atmosphere to launch direct negotiations in the future. He said that the proposed proximity
talks essentially are based on Senator Mitchell continuing his trips between the Palestinians
and Israelis. As far as we are concerned, we shall abide by the Arab position. He also said

we will not develop any position with respect to negotiations without Arab consensus whether
in terms of accepting or rejecting the US ideas.

With regards to resumption of direct negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis, WAR
said that there are no proposals (ideas) at present time to resume direct negotiations. He
said that the Arab and Palestinian position on this issue is clear; there needs to be a clear
TOR for negotiations and total cessation of settlement activities.   He said that the PA
position in principle is not against negotiations. On the contrary its for negotiations that
do not waste time since the Palestinian national interest requires a solution as soon as
possible to create the independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as capital. WAR went on
to say that before talking about resumption of direct negotiations, there is a need to
clarify the basis of these negotiations and to know the fate of settlements and to what
extent will Israeli abide by freezing settlement activities.

With respect to Israeli provocations which seriously tamper with security and stability, WAR
said that Israel does not want a return to negotiations but wants to blame the Palestinians
by saying they don't want to enter negotiations. WAR went on to say 'It is imperative to take
away this pretext by exposing the real Israeli position to the international community and
the Us administration. He said we are ready to resume negotiations on clear basis but its
the Israeli side that places obstacles to avert meeting its commitments while blaming the
Palestinian side (as Israel is accustomed to doing).
