On my way home. The conference was a big success. I met with Cherie Blair on the gender gap in cell phones -
technology that may be even be more tramsformative than microcredit. Phil was with GSMA for the release of their
study so we're going to figure out how we van get industry on board, etc. Cherie was involved in the GSMA study as well.
We'll both be at CGI retreat later this week where we'll raise it as well. She sends her love.
The conference referenced you over and over. Dr Mukwege personally thanked you for your leadership. Some ofthe
congolese women parliamentarians want to see if they can raise theirvoices to some good end the way the Liberians did.
We will see what we can do to help them.
DVF had an incredible awards ceremony last night. Our Haitian activist got one of the 50K prizes. DVF went on and on
about how your leadership was really responsible for the evening and what it represented.The awardees all mentioned
you. I talked to        last night. I think we can get. him to fund college scolarships for afghan women.
Another awardee was one of our afghan women who's bldg schools.
I can't thank you enuf for Friday. I thought your legacy was manifested in every way.
BTW, Paul Charron was there last night and sends his best. He's such a good guy.

I'm heading home exhausted but gratified by what we've been able to do.
