PRAGUE (Reuters) - A senior Russian official said Kyrgyz President Bakiyev had not fulfilled a promise to close a U.S. air
base in the Central Asian nation and suggested Moscow would urge its new leaders to do so. "In Kyrgyzstan there should
be only one base - Russian," the official told reporters in Prague on condition of anonymity.
