Let's talk tomorrow. I'll call you in the morning about two subjects: Haiti and Af-Pak. Is there anything else you want to
raise?

Welcome back. I changed my plans and will be back in DC this morning. I have meetings between 9 and noon but will
be available any time in the afternoon today or tomorrow and can work around your schedule. After spending several
hours on the phone last night I wanted to come back and attend to some of the logistical coordination issues.

Jack--

  In looking at my schedule, I could talk w you by phone Sunday or Monday, rather than meeting, which would give you
back your Monday and service event. I learned the office will be closed Monday, so I will be working from home. Does
that make sense?

 What times would be good to talk tomorrow or Monday?

 Thx, Hillary
