  Cheryl - See below the response of Leslie Voltaire and PM Jean Max Bellerive to talking points for tomorrow's
  Montreal meeting I proposed yesterday. Talking points at the end. Response positive. I have also shared these
  with Paul Fanner. Same response. Sources at the UN fear, however, that the donors will focus on PAP and miss
  this historic opportunity. - Bob

Leslie - First, thank god you were in NYC on Jan 12th. I hope your personal losses were minimal. Surely,
Haiti has lost much. We all have...

Thoughts for Montreal:

1. This offers an opportunity to 'rebalance' Haiti.
2. Pay attention to the exodus from PAP and catch up with it. (The migration to PAP over the past 30 years was
an unnatural development, spurred by rural neglect and urban concentration.)
3. A decentralized system of 'welcome centers' in town and villages can assist returnees re-integrate. Medical
and continuing education services should be a part of them. NEED TO ACT NOW.
4. More important, the centers must be equipped to provide work - make them the basis for organizing the civic
service corps. Higly decentralized: work for cash; public works/environmental restoration/food production;
restoration of human dignity; rural-urban partnerships through work;e in Haiti's real future. Also a chance to
begin repairing the social fabric. Will need a 'tough love' approach; disciplined management. Not the work for
NG0s.
5. No investment in rural areas and no response to this opportunity will = back to the future re. crowded
PAP. People will trickle back to the city to replicate past problems.
6. The damage was done before the earthquake by development/investment policies that ignored the rural areas;
saw Haitians simply as sources of cheap labor; denigrated human dignity; failed to strengthen local institutions.
7. This must stop; can't happen again.
8. This is the time to move forward with the Civic Service Corps - quickly.

kenbe. F'a lage. - Bob
