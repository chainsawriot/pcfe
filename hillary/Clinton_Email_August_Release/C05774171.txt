Subject: (AP) - Ed Miliband is new UK Labour Party leader

LONDON (AP) - Britain's opposition Labour Party elected Ed Miliband as its new leader on September 25 after a brother-
versus-brother battle to replace ex-prime minister Gordon Brown. Miliband, the 40-year-old ex-climate change
secretary, narrowly defeated his elder brother David Miliband, the 45-year-old former foreign secretary, in a ballot of
legislators, party activists and about 3.5 million labor union members. Three other candidates also competed in the
contest to replace Brown, who stepped down in May after Labour came in second in a national election and was
removed from office after 13 years by the Conservative Party-led coalition government.
