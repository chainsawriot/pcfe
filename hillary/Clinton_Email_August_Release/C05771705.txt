Subject: an SP memo on possible legal and nonlegal strategies re wikileaks

Following this morning's meetings I activated my four legal eagles on the SP staff Peter Harrell,
Jen Harris, Bill Burke White, and Catherine Powell (that includes two law profs and two Yale law
grads who certainly could be law profs). They in turn reached out to people at the Berkmann
Center at Harvard and other experts, working together with Alec Ross. Alec has been particularly
useful in terms not only of his knowledge but also his sensitivity to how anything we might try to
do could impact our own internet freedom agenda. The result is the attached memo, which has one
interesting legal approach and I think some very good suggestions about how to handle our public
diplomacy. AM
