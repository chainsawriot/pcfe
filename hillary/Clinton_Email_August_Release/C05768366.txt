You may already be aware of this, but in the event you aren't: A Spanish helicopter based on their Navy ship "Castilla"
disappeared in a mountainous region near the Dominican border shortly before noon. The Spanish Embassy called us,
and JTF scrambled a helo. Chilean MINUSTAH helo had also been dispatched. The Spanish helo apparently crashed and
burned in an area where rescue helos could not land, so a JTF helo landed in the closest area and US troops with
stretchers hiked in. On arrival, they reported that the crew of four had all been killed. We are getting body bags into
the site now and will remove the bodies today. This is the first fatality involving foreign troops engaged in earthquake
response.

Thanks, will pass it along to those who responded. Sorry there was not a better outcome. As happened here, we do keep

Gen! Keen,

The Spanish Ambassador just called to express his government's gratitude for the U.S. rescue/recovery efforts regarding
the helicopter. I told him all credit was due to my colleagues in the U.S. military and that I would pass along his thanks to
you.
