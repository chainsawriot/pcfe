Cheryl

Spoke to him

Feels pressdre to do something

Made it clear that now was not the time â€” would potentially work against

Said he could tell the families that he had spoken to me and that State Department was working this issue as it
concerned about any AmCit world-wide who is in custody

He agreed to hold off for a while

And I promised to keep in touch

[he remembered me from previous time at State so that may have helped a bit]

Regards

pat
