Can you call Froman and discuss the cotton issue since I told the press--in response to a question--that I knew there
would be retaliatory actions announced next week and that a high level delegation would come from DC to make a
countervailing proposal w the hope of avoiding the imposition of the retaliation 30 days after they're announced. So
what are the odds of that working? Not high, I believe so this combined w refusal on Iran sanctions will lead to difficult
reactions from Congress toward Brazil. Then we have management problem on our hands.
