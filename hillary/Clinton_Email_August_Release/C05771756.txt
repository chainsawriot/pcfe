BAGHDAD (AP) â€” Iraq's Prime Minister will travel to Iran and Jordan to seek support for his bid to win a second term more
than seven months after national elections. His adviser Ali al-Moussawi said the prime minister will assure the
neighboring states that none of Iraq's major political constituencies will be excluded from a new government if they back
his second term. Al-Maliki will meet Jordan's King Abdullah II on October 17. He will meet with Iran's President
Ahmadinejad and the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei in Tehran on October 18. He will also visit Turkey and Egypt
next week.
