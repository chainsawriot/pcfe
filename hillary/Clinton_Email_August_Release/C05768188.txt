Subject: (Reuters) Netanyahu cancels trip to Obama's nuclear summit

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has cancelled a planned trip to Washington next
week to take part in President Barack Obama's 47-country nuclear security summit conference. He made the decision
after learning that Egypt and Turkey intended to raise the issue of Israel's presumed nuclear arsenal at the conference, a
senior government official said. Israel is believed to the only nuclear-armed power in the Middle East but has never
confirmed or denied that it possesses atomic weapons.
