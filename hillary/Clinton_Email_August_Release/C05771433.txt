In Kosovo crazy for the Clintons

PRISTINA, KOSOVO- This poor, tiny corner of Europe turned into the Land of Clinton on Wednesday, with thousands of
Kosovo residents turning out to greet Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and pay homage to her husband.
Former president Bill Clinton is revered here for his role in ending the Yugoslav "ethnic cleansing" campaign of the late
1990s.
Arriving in Pristina, Clinton's motorcade slowed to a halt on the central Bill Clinton Boulevard, and she hopped out of her
car to personally inspect an 11-foot gold statue of the former president. She waved and smiled as a crowd brandished
American flags, applauded and chanted "Hill-a-REE!! Hill-a-REE!"
Above the little plaza, an image of Clinton grinned from a giant billboard. Hillary Clinton's face beamed from another
billboard nearby, bearing the word "Welcome."
After posing for photos with the Bill Clinton statue, the secretary of state ducked into the Hillary boutique next door.
As she emerged, a local reporter approached. "Do you like it?" the reporter asked, gesturing to the statue. "Your
husband."
"Yes! And look, a store with my name," said the secretary of state, holding a shopping bag inscribed "Boutique Hillary."
Asked what she thought of Kosovo, Hillary Clinton replied, "I'm so glad to be back after 10 years. It's wonderful."
The chief U.S. diplomat was concluding a three-day Balkan tour that also took her to Bosnia and Serbia.
During her husband's administration, NATO bombed Yugoslavia to force it to end an "ethnic cleansing" campaign in
Kosovo, a breakaway province largely populated by ethnic Albanians.
Kosovo declared independence in 2008.
