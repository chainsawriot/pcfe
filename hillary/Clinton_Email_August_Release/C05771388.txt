ZAGREB (AP) - Serbia's president will lay wreaths at the mass grave of Croats slain by Serbs during the 1991 war,
becoming the first Serbian leader to pay his respects to the victims of a massacre that remains a potent symbol of
wartime brutality.
  Boris Tadic and his Croatian counterpart, Ivo Josipovic, on November 4 will also honor 18 Serbs killed by Croats in a
nearby village.
  The visit to Ovcara, a pig farm near the eastern city of Vukovar where more than 200 Croat prisoners of war and
civilians were executed, is a "profoundly symbolic act," said Josko Paro, Josipovic's foreign policy adviser.
