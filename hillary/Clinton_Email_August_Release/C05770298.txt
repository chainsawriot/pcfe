As you may be aware, earlier this year, OIG issued a very negative report on our Public Diplomacy operations
throughout Africa. I have attached a copy of the action plan which Johnnie and his team developed to address the
issues raised in the report. The plan is a very deliberate effort to address the shortcomings identified by the 01G, do a
better job of integrating public diplomacy and public affairs into the whole AF Bureau, and deliver better PD and PA
work.

I think it is an excellent report and provides a good model for the bureaus as we endeavor to create a new direction for
Public Diplomacy.
