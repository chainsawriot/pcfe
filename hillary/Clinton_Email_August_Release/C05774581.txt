Subject: The matter I raised on my end of the converation last night

Just reached Tom about it. Alerted him to the version as it came to me, including potential of its breaking. He seemed
a) aware of the basis for what I'd heard, b) to share my assessment/concern (though asked me to elaborate, which I did
vividly), and c) prepared to make sure that whatever ready to be is said publicly - and whatever happens diplomatically -
put the kibosh on the version as it came to me.
   Incidentally, unbidden by me on both points-i.e., volunteering-he went out of his way to says upbeat things about you
and downbeat things about OMF. Said he wanted to discuss that with me in person. I said nothing of substance, except
always glad to talk.
   Over and out, tho would appreciate you're confirming receipt, since I'm not cc'ing anyone on this.
   Cha-cha-cha (even though you're not going to Argentina-and rightly so).
