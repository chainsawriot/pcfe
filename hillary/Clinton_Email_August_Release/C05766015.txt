ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE/ATTORNEY WORK-PRODUCT


And Happy New Year to you (and your family) too! I am so thrilled to be in this job and working with you. I am having a
great time, and hope to have an even better 2010.


Re Blackwater. I have already put these very questions to our team, and they are working up a memo on the subject.
Significantly, the press accounts are all saying that State Department lawyers appropriately warned the DOJ prosecutors,
but that the DOJ lawyers chose to take a different route.

My initial reactions to your questions are as follows:




I will keep pressing and give you an oral report at Monday's 8:45, and we can get the promised memo to you soon
thereafter.


Please let me know if you need more.
Best
Harold

Harold---

  First, Happy New Year to you and your family and thank you for all of your great work this past year. I am looking   B5
forward to the year ahead.

 Second, what can we do about Judge Urbina's ruling                                                             For
example, what is the likelihood of success on appeal? Can the US file a civil action against the company? Pay
compensation to the victims? What other options do we have?

 All the best, H
