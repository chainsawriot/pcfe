Subject: (The Detroit News) Burned Quran smeared with feces found at East Lansing mosque

(The Detroit News) - A burned Quran was found at a mosque in East Lansing September 11, prompting the Michigan
chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-MI) to ask the FBI to investigate.


CAIR-MI reports that officials of the Islamic Center of East Lansing say vandals left a burned Quran at the front entrance
of the mosque and scatted pages in the street nearby.


"The perpetrators of this unconscionable act of religious intimidation must be apprehended and prosecuted to the full
extent of state and federal law," CAIR-MI Executive Director Dawud Walid, said in a statement.


Torn pages of the Quran appeared to be smeared with feces, CAIR officials said.


A spokesman for the FBI could not immediately be reached for comment.


A Florida pastor's plan to burn a Quran on Saturday, the ninth anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, resulted in
worldwide condemnation and protests. Pastor Terry Jones of Gainesville, Fla., later abandoned his plan.
