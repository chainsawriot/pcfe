Hi there,

Would you mind passing the below note onto HRC from Bono and Ali?

Many thanks
Catriona




Dearest Hillary,

Happy Birthday - we're sad to have missed the other night, but arrived late from the west coast.

We are in NY for a month... if you and Bill are upstate and have time for a catch up, let us know.

Love Bono & Ali
