Subject:                             Happy New Year and onto 2010!



Rich---Thanks for all you did to make the past year a successful one, I hope you and your family will have a happy and
healthy new year. I'm looking forward to 2010!

Here's some questions and I'm copying Jake so he can help w the followup--

Right before I left, Kirsten Gillibrand called to discuss her cybersecurity bill. She wants to draft it so it favors State. I told
her we would connect her up w the right person who would call her to discuss in the new year. Who should that be in
your shop or elsewhere? Pis let me know so I can call and tell her.

When I was in Kabul, the Aga Khan told me he had given a "roadmap" to stability in Afghanistan and wanted me to see
it. That's all I know; can you track it down?
