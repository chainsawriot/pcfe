From Larry King last night:

LARRY KING: How is the -- it was so bitter -- well, rather bitter in the campaign with Hillary, when they were going at
each other.

MICHELLE OBAMA: Yes, it seems so long ago.

KING: Yes. How are they doing now together?
OBAMA: They're great. Hillary Clinton is an amazing secretary of State. I mean she would have been an amazing
president. She was an amazing attorney. She's a phenomenal professional. And she's proven to be a tremendous asset in
-- in so many ways. So the relationship is -- is -- is strong. They share the same views in terms of international policy and
approach. And we're seeing the outcome of that on the international stage. I think, you know, we can say pretty clearly
that the United States -- the -- the view of this nation around the world has changed. People are enthusiastic about the
potential. Things aren't perfect. We're still a nation fighting two wars. But when we travel around the country, the
excitement and the possibility are palpable. And I think that's because of the president, but I think it's also because of
our secretary of State.
