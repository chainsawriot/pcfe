Subject Clinton intro

Andrew -

  It's a good strong intro that not only mentions her great record in the Senate, but also highlights her record as
Secretary of State -fighting against efforts to delegitimize Israel, defending Israel against Goldstone, supporting the
increase in aid to Israel, and fighting to secure strong sanctions against Iran. Should set a strong, positive tone.

  Have a safe trip,

      Ester
