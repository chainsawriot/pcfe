I don't know if you'll be speaking to Roza Otunboyeva, the interim leader in Kyrgyzstan, but if you do, it might be
interesting to mention that you know of her commitment to microcredit. She was instrumental in bringing FINCA to
Kyrgyzstan and when you made your trip there you saw what a difference it was making to lift up women and their
families. She also was her country's head of delegation to Beijing. She was foreign minister at the time and made a strong
statement about gender equality and the transformative power of microcredit. I think she had an overseas post when you
visited Kyrgyz so I don't think you met her.

I know it's a very complicated situation there now with our use of the base in potential jeopardy, but I thought this info
might be useful in some way        assuming she manages to hold on.

I'm off to Lithuania, Russia and Egypt later today.
