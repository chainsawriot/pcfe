Pol Dirs mtg went ok today. Ad ref agreement on Ministerial statement for Wed (Einhorn will get you copy), and general
consensus on workplan for preparing for eventual mtg with Iran. R's and C's relatively mellow. We'll see on Wed -- will
get more detailed background and pts for HRC tomorrow.

5+1 mtgs have all the allure for me that Quartet mtgs had in an earlier incarnation ... right up there with colonoscopies.

Take care,

Bill
