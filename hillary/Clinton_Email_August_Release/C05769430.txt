Subject: RE: Public Afghanistan Strategy

The approach we took was to integrate our emphasis on women throughout the strategy, vice indicating that it was a
separate effort. All of our programs benefit women, usually be specific design. Below are a few places under education,
health and judicial access where women's issues are highlighted in the strategy. We are completely open to how best to
address this.


Page ii - "improving ed opps for all Afghansn regardless of gender, is a top priority"

Page 11 - protecting women's rights in Af cited in context of judicial reform

Page 12- "emphase on legal aid, gender, and juv justice issues" in enhancing access to justice

Page 18 - "significant gains in...ensuring ed opportunities for all Afghans, regardless of gender"

Page 21 - protecting women in Pak cited as priority

Yes, it is accurate. Unless I am badly mistaken, the report does not have a separate section on women.

The real issue is â€” is it accurate that the strategy does not have a section regarding women, which would seem almost
impossible.
