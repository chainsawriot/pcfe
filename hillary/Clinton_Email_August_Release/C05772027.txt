Subject: Arrest of C.1 Murderer

PLEASE PASS TO THE SECRETARY


As has been reported in the press, the Mexican Federal Police arrested Arturo Gallegos Castrellon (known as
Benny), who (according to the Federal Police) confessed to ordering the killing of the three individuals
associated with our consulate in Ciudad Juarez. We believe that "Benny" is the person who ordered these
murders, as well as many of the other high-profile killings in Juarez over the past year.

The relationships among relevant criminal groups in Juarez is complicated: "Benny" headed a gang that
took orders from an armed enforcement group called La Linea that works for the Juarez cartel. I
mentioned in a note some weeks ago that the person who pulled the trigger is under a sealed indictment
in the United States, and we cannot talk about this publicly.

Two key points:




Again, thank you for all you have done personally to sustain the morale of our personnel in Ciudad
Juarez.

Carlos Pascual
