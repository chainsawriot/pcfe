RAMALLAH (AP) â€” Palestinian President Abbas said the Palestinians are willing to end all historic claims against Israel
once they get their state as part of a peace deal. An end-of-claims declaration is a long-standing Israeli demand, and
Abbas addressed the issue in an interview with Israel TV on October 17. Abbas said negotiating with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains his preferred choice, but that he cannot return to talks unless settlement expansion
stops. Abbas said other options remain on the table, including seeking UN recognition of a Palestinian state. He said
resignation is not an option for now.
