Great. I wonder if the problem has something to do with the fob system. Will let you know what I find out.

Not to be too neurotic about this but want to be sure you got my response about the meetings in Tampa yesterday. If
not I will resend.

 Just curious whether you received the emails I sent to you over the past 2 months, re; pakistan, doug holloway, etc.
 Nothing urgent they were informational only but I am concerned our emails may be hitting some tech glitch.
