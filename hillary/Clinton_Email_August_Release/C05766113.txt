I think Jake should be on the call.

Once the call is scheduled, I will get a version to you before the call that reflects the latest revisions I've

 The latest draft is getting closer. And I agree w Dan that we have to be careful not to topple the tree w too
 many ornaments. That said, I'd like to have a call w you (and anyone else who you think should be on) this
 afternoon or evening to raise a few points. I'm copying Lona and Huma so they can help schedule it. Thanks
 for all your good work.
