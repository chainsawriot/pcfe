Hillary -

Thanks a lot for all the good wishes you have sent via Lois. It has been one of the pleasures of the last few months to see
you going from strength to strength. And the wedding looked fantastic!

Your message on Saturday was poignant. Losing is tough. When you win the party members and MPs doubly so. (When
it's your brother...). But I am so proud of the campaign we ran, the issues we raised etc. We got people to believe in a
New Labour platform - and modernised the platform.

I have announced today that I will stay in Parliament but not in shadow cabinet.




Thanks for all your encouragement over the last couple of years. I will let you know when I am in DC.

All best,
                                                                                                                     1.4(B)
                                                                                                                     1.4(D)
                                                                                                                     B1
