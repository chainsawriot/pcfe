     Dear Mr. President,

     We are writing to express our support for ratification of the New START Treaty and full funding
     for the modernization of our nuclear weapons arsenal, as outlined by your updated report that
     was mandated by Section 1251 of the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010.

     We also ask that, in your future budget requests to Congress, you include the funding identified
     in that report on nuclear weapons modernization. Should you choose to limit non-defense
     discretionary spending in any future budget requests to Congress, funding for nuclear
     modernization in the National Nuclear Security Agency's proposed budgets should be
     considered defense spending, as it is critical to national security and, therefore, not subject to
     such limitations. Further, we ask that an updated 1251 report be submitted with your budget
     request to Congress each year.

     We look forward to working with you on the ratification of the New START Treaty and
     modernization of the National Nuclear Security Agency's nuclear weapons facilities. This
     represents a long-term commitment by each of us, as modernization of our nuclear arsenal will
     require a sustained effort.

                                                 Sincerely,




     Daniel                                                       Thad Cochran
     United States Senator                                        United States Senator




                   em
