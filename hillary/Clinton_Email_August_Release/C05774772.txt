For the breakfast tomorrow, we provided two options for your remarks. The first is longer and gives an around the
world + qddr update. Might take 12 to 15 minutes. The second is short (less than 2 pages) and makes a qddr and start
pitch, but leaves the around the world part for q and a. Either approach would work, but wanted to ensure you had
both options in your book so you could decide.
