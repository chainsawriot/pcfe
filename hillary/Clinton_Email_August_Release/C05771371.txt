Subject: (AP) Gaza militants fire heavy rocket into Israel

JERUSALEM (AP) Israel's military says Gaza militants have fired a military-grade rocket into Israel, causing light damage
and no injuries. Militants from inside Gaza regularly fire small rockets they manufacture themselves and only rarely use
military-grade projectiles such as the relatively powerful Grad launched early on November 19. None of the armed
groups in Hamas-ruled Gaza immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. An Israeli airstrike this week killed two
senior members of one such group, the Army of Islam. Another faction released a video in Hebrew threatening
retaliation for their deaths.
