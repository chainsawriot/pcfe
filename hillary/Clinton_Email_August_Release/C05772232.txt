NEW YORK (Reuters) - The BRIC nations want the United Nations to rebuke countries that resort to unilateral sanctions
not approved by the U.N. Security Council, Brazilian Foreign Minister Amorim said September 21.

  A resolution on that theme, if approved by the U.N. General Assembly, could contribute to erode the legitimacy of
additional sanctions imposed by the United States and other Western powers against Iran's nuclear program.

   Amorim said the BRIC group, which includes Brazil, Russia, India and China, discussed the proposed resolution during
a meeting of foreign ministers on September 21 in New York.
