Dear Ms Mills,

My name is Steven Everts and I am responsible in the Private Office of HR/VP Ashton for EU-US relations (I was the one
handlig the very successful meeting in Washington that the Secretary had with the HR/VP on 21 Jan).

I now have a more personal issue: apparently the Secretary and the HR/VP spoke briefly in London                         B6
The HR asked me whether there is a more personal, direct email she could use for transmitting this type of messages?

From our side, the email to use would be                                                                                 B6

I would be very grateful if you could send us an email which is similarly private.

Many thanks for your help.

Kind regards

Steven Everts

Private Office of HR/VP Catherine Ashton
