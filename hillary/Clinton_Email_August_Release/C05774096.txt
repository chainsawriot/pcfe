Subject: Israel's ex-president Katsav guilty of rape (Reuters)

TEL AVIV (Reuters) - An Israeli court found former President Moshe Katsav guilty of rape on December 30,
media reports said, convictions of unprecedented gravity for a head of the Jewish state. Katsav, president from
2000 to 2007, had denied the charges of rape, molestation or harassment lodged by three ex-aides. He may now
try to contest the Tel Aviv District Court's verdict, and what could be a lengthy jail sentence, in the Supreme
Court.
