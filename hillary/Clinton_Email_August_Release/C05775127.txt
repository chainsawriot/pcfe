You mentioned at Thursday's 8:45 meeting that you had talked to Qureshi and that he thought he was not going to get
any trade access to the EU. My EU contact writes that the Member States in the EU have been slowing up progress on
trade concessions to Pakistan, although the draft language negotiated w/ Pakistan still leaves room for the Commission
(which is pro-trade) to keep working on enhanced trade benefits for Pakistan. Still, the original timetable of 2011 will not
be kept. Even more ominous, any agreement will have to go to the European Parliament, which is down on Pakistan for
human rights reasons.




I have also read Esther's note to you on UN Security Council Reform. You are right that overall our best position for the
moment is




Have a good trip!
