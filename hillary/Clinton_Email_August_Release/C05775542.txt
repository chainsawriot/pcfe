 To emphasize this latter point. Zardari sent his Commerce Min to Kabul while I was there to formally sign the Transit
 Trade agreemdnt in a big ceremony Un which both sides praised the US for making it possible. Lots of pro-US media.

9) I field tested this with the press twice--in Kabul Thursday and DC Friday. Will see NYTimes Ed Board monday to
continue this "shaping campaign" ahead of Lisbon.




11) Aftrr looking closely at Lisbon sched, I see no reason to go. I have to be in l'bad 2 days earlier, and am way iver-
travelled right now.
                                                                                                                           1.4(B)
12) Tom is replacing Aneesh Ghoul for india. A leading contender appears to be jonah Blank.                                1.4(D)
                                                                                                                           B1
13) Tom still looking for a woman to replace Luz S-R, ivo is helping with the search.

14) Dinner with Mullen tonight. Tom has apparently not yet asked him formally for a senior mil advisor, but I assume he
will.
Discussed his succesor drama.

15) Ruggiero and Lute still in region.

16) Massive 2011 personnel issues in Kabul at every level, which I am trying to sort out.

17) Enjoy Hanoi. Best to all.
