PROVAL RATINGS FOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS DROP ACROSS THE BOARD
3Poll of "news watchers" — a nationwide survey of registered voters who say they follow the news "closely" or "very closely" — finds that the job
 ratings of President Obama, his top aides and Cabinet officials have fallen considerably during the past seven months.

The July 2010 Clams Poll shows that only two members of the Obama team, Secretary of State Hilary Clinton (64 percent) and Defense Secretar}
Robert Gates (56 percent), were surveyed to have job approval ratings of more than 50 percent.

Clinton, Obama's opponent in the 2008 Democratic primaries, received the highest job rating in the "news watchers" survey, but her 64 percent ra
the July 2010 poll is down 11 points since the December 2009 Clams Inner Circle poll.

Gates, who is second with a 56 percent approval rating, suffered the biggest drop —down 13 points since December.

President Obama, who scored a 45 percent job approval rating in the July 2010 poll, is down 6 points from where he was seven months ago.

nine officials tested, six have higher disapproval than approval ratings — Obama, Timothy Geithner, Janet Napolitano, Ken Salazar, Rahm Emanuel

Clinton and Gates owe their higher ratings to stronger bipartisan appeal. Clinton received 45 percent approval from Republicans and 57 percent fn
independents. Gates scored 45 percent from both Republicans and independents.

Both Obama and Clinton posted 90 percent approval scores among Democrats. Gates, who was first appointed to his current job by GOP President
George W. Bush, received a 76 percent approval rating from Democratic news watchers.

Obama's ratings were more politically polarized: The president received a 35 percent job approval from independents and a dismal 14 percent frot
Republicans. Obama won the 2008 election by drawing 52 percent of independent voters.

In addition to Clinton and Gates, the only other administration official to have higher approval than disapproval ratings is Press Secretary Robert C
(43 percent to 34 percent).

Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar, who has been on the hot seat because of the Gulf oil spill, scored the lowest job rating (22 percent) of all tho
tested.
