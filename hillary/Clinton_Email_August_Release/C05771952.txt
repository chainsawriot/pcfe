 Concept and rationale




         This original English-language "as told to" memoir will bring out her full story with a
 concreteness and vividness that will inform and move English-speaking readers. Her dramatic,
 engaging life story, told in her own voice, will reveal much that we never knew about China, its
 society, culture, politics, history, and the sufferings of its rural people, from the viewpoint of a
 distinctive, vivid individual. The book will show us Chinese society over a long span of time,
 and across a range of social classes and experiences. In this age of Chinese "soft power" when
 we are exposed to many images of a cosmopolitan China that is much like us, this book will
 allow Western readers to know a women whose personality and experiences are authentically
 Chinese, and to meet a hero who has a sharp tongue and is a real person. Above all, her life story
 brings to light the true situation of those with no voices, the rural people, the women and
 children, the sufferers.

 possible deposit in an oral history collection. She is prepared to start as soon as support is
 acquired. The grant needs to cover her living expenses for about a year to participate in the
 project, which I estimate at           However, health insurance is also needed, and whether this
 can be covered by a grant of that size depends on how the grant is administered. For example, if
