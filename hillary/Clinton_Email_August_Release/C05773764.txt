Cheryl -

Please accept my thanks for your help and the help of your excellent
staff,
especially Nora, when I became ill in Cairo earlier this week. We are
home
now and I am doing better. I am grateful to Mary Grandfield and others
at
the Embassy, with special thanks to Mark Perry who was very attentive
and
extremely helpful. He called repeatedly to check up on me and, very
importantly, arranged help at the Cairo airport.

It is a real comfort to be able to call on old friends and to get such a
positive response.

With thanks and all good wishes,

Howard
