Subject:                              Update on Head Speechwriter



Lissa and I met at the end of last week.

She had worked through a number of candidates.

She had narrowed to 3:                 (but see below);                         ; and            She was continuing her             B6
outreach.

Her email below is the latest update.

She has agreed not to depart even on 1 June if we have not yet settled and brought someone on board but I think we
are on track to do interviews the next two weeks and then give sample writings and opportunities to decide in sufficient
time.

Her update below is fyi to you.

Cheryl,

Bad news:                                                                                                                He was
disappointed. On the other hand, that opens the way for me to talk to                                            and is very
good (also was on                    has written a book; and was an editor at                             is in late 30s or early
40s, will find out more). He happens to be

The good news is that                             is potentially seriously interested. I have talked to him for several hours on
the phone and we have communicated by email. I think he could be a superb fit based on his experience at                  and
before. In any case, he is deciding whether to pursue this (which involves moving to DC from77)and will let me
know in the next day or two. I will try to get him here so we can all meet him in person and he can see the landscape and
decide whether it might be a good fit for him.

I'm also reaching out to                                                          during our years), but I doubt he'll do it
(Derek and Vinca know him well but think he will want to stay put at                    where he is now managing editor).
We'll see.

    No answer yet from                 I emailed them at their AOL address a couple of days ago.
