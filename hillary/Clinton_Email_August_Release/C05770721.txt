Subject:                           Assessing our progress to date and proposing possible ways to create more leverage



For your reading pleasure on the way home, S/P has been working on a project that I discussed with Jake a while back --
aimed at figuring out where we could do better and above all create more leverage to achieve our goals. The papers are
blunter than anything you would see from the bureaus -- they should not necessarily be read as policy blueprints but
rather as illustrations of alternative strategies. We have made sure that the special assistants have them on the plane. I
will also share the individual papers with the relevant assistant secretaries. We will then be happy to take the project
further if you approve.

You will be happy to know that rain has stopped at the Expo!
