Good morning Doug -

I think my response bounced back so I'm trying this again (apologies if you get two emails from me) Send me any points
you would want to have made in the letter, as well as if it should be addressed to anyone in particular, and we'll get it
done!

Thanks!

Thanks so much! I'll work with Rob on the letter.

FYI, I'm meeting with Judith McHale this week to talk about Pakistan, per our previous conversation. I've also been
talking with NDI about being the interlocutor for the strategic communications program for the government and political
parties.

I think it's best for USG and all involved that it go through a respected NGO. They're keen to help.

Of course. I will send a letter and welcome you                        to DC. The closer the better!

I'm copying Rob Russo so he can work w you to draft the letter.

This is very exciting.
