                                       Jean-Paul Sartre,
                                       "Anti-Semite and
                                       Jew"
                                I am not sure when I first detected
                                the noxious fumes that would
                                envelop the conservative
                                movement in the Obama era. It
                                might have been early on, in
                                April 2009, when I visited a
                                series of gun shows in rural
                                California and Nevada. Perusing
                                tables piled high with high-
                                caliber semi-automatic weapons
                                and chatting with anyone in my
                                vicinity, I heard urgent warnings
                                of mass roundups, concentration
                                camps, and a socialist
                                government in Washington.
                                "These people that are purchasing
                                these guns are people that are
                                worried about what's going on in
                                this country," a gun dealer told
                                me outside a show in Reno.
                                "Good luck Obama," a young gun
                                enthusiast remarked to me. "We
                                outnumber him 100 to 1." At this
                                 time, the Tea Party movement
                                 had not even registered on the
                                 national media's radar.
                                 In September 2009, I led a panel
                                 discussion about this book inside
                                 an auditorium filled with nearly
                                 100 students and faculty at the
                                 University of California-
                                 Riverside. Beside me sat Jonathan
                                 Walton, an African-American
                                 professor of religious studies and
                                 prolific writer, and Mark Takano,
                                 an erudite, openly gay former
                                 Democratic congressional
                                 candidate and local community
                                  college trustee. In the middle of
                                  our discussion, a dozen College
                                  Republicans stormed the front of
                                  the stage with signs denouncing
                                  me as a "left-wing hack" while a
                                  hysterical young man leaped from
                                  the crowd, blowing kisses
                                  mockingly at Takano while
                                  heckling Walton as a "racist."

                                officers insisted on escorting me
                                to my ride after the right-wing
                                heckler attempted to follow me as
                                he shouted threats.

                                Who was this stalker? Just a
                                concerned citizen worried about
                                taxes? His name was Ryan Sorba
                                and he was an operative of a
                                heavily funded national
                                conservative youth outfit, the
                                Intercollegiate Studies Institute.
                                Besides founding dozens of
                                Republican youth groups across
                                the country, Sorba has devoted an
                                exceptional amount of energy to
                                his interest in homosexuals. His
                                intellectual output consists of a
                                tract titled The Born Gay Hoax,
                                arguing that homosexuality is at
                                once a curable disease and a
                                bogus trend manufactured by
                                academic leftists. Adding to his
                                credentials, Sorba has a history of
                                run-ins with the law, he explained
                                when I called him about the
                                order.

                                My encounter with this
                                aggressive right-wing cadre
                                seemed a strange, isolated event.
                                But the hostility turned out to be
                                symptomatic of the intensifying
                                campaign to delegitimize
                                President Obama and his allies in
                                Congress. The Right's days of
                                rage were only beginning.

                                Through his first year in office,
                                Obama seemed oblivious to the
                                threat of the far right. He
                                campaigned against partisanship,
                                declaring that there were "no red
                                states" and no "conservative
                                America." Apparently, he thought
                                it was merely a contrivance or
                                myth that there were people who
                                rejected science, demonized gays,
                                assailed minority and women's
                                rights -- or that they genuinely
                                believed in what they said.

                                Speaking of changing
                                Washington, Obama seemed to
                                think that the entire history of
                                politics since the rise of Reagan
                                and the Right and their strategies
                                of polarization was not deeply
                                rooted but a superficial problem
                                attributable to certain "divisive"
                                personalities, easily wiped away
                                with gestures toward
                                bipartisanship. His view of the
                                parties was that they were simply
                                mirror images sharing
                                fundamental beliefs but separated
                                by "partisans." The skilled and
                                devoted community organizer
                                could bring them together.
                                Many of his supporters in the
                                media, often part and parcel of
                                political wars over the years,
                                reinforced and amplified his
                                innocence, proclaiming he was
                                the one at last who could "bridge •
                                the partisan divide." Andrew

                                conservative who once called
                                critics of George W. Bush
                                policies "fifth columnists" but
                                now fervently supporting Obama,
                                wrote that the new president was
                                destined to become "a liberal
                                Reagan who can reunite
                                America." This optimism
                                pervaded the Obama White
                                House as the president and his
                                aides sought out Republicans
                                willing to vote for his programs.
                                After all, why couldn't we all just
                                get along?

                                In his autobiographical book The
                                Audacity of Hope, Obama
                                highlighted a key component of
                                his political strategy: "I serve as a
                                blank screen on which people of
                                vastly different political stripes
                                project their own views." Once he
                                was elected, conservatives
                                concluded that they could reverse
                                Obama's strength by transforming
                                him into a human tableau for the

                               most fearsome images they could
                               conjure.

                               Obama's multiracial background
                               was crucial in cultivating
                               resentment among the shock
                               troops. Those who rejected
                               Obama's legitimacy to serve as
                               president on the basis of his
                               background gave birth to the
                               "Birther" movement that sought
                               to challenge his citizenship. The
                               movement's most visible figure,
                               and therefore the most eccentric,
                               was Orly Taitz, a dentist and self-
                               trained lawyer who had
                               immigrated from the former
                               Soviet republican of Moldova to
                               Israel before settling in the
                               conservative bastion of Orange
                               County, California. Convinced by
                               claims on the far-right Web site
                                WorldNetDaily that Obama
                               planned to create a "civilian
                               national security force," Taitz
                               told me she "realized that Obama
                               was another Stalin--it's a cross
                                between Stalinist USSR and
                                Hitler's Germany."

                                After becoming transfixed by
                                online conspiracy theories
                                claiming Obama's family had
                                forged his birth certificate in
                                Hawaii, Taitz snapped into
                                action. She filed a lawsuit in
                                November 2008 with California
                                Secretary of State Debra Bowen
                                demanding an investigation into
                                Obama's eligibility to serve as
                                president. Taitz's plaintiff in the
                                case was Wiley Drake, an Orange
                                County radio preacher and former
                                second vice president of the
                                Southern Baptist Convention who
                                once publicly prayed for Obama's
                                death. While her lawsuit went
                                nowhere, and subsequent suits
                                earned her angry rebukes from
                                 judges, Taitz became an instant
                                 media sensation, delivering

                                Obama before friendly
                                interviewers from Sean Haimity
                                to CNN's Lou Dobbs, who Taitz
                                called her "greatest supporter"
                                and who was eventually fired as
                                an indirect result of his hosting of
                                her.

                                In March 2009, Texas Rep.
                                Randy Neugebauer signed on to a
                                Birther bill proposing that future
                                presidential candidates must
                                prove their citizenship before
                                becoming eligible to campaign.
                                The Birther movement had found
                                its voice in goverment and made
                                an indelible impact on the
                                Republican grassroots. By June
                                2009, 28 percent of Republican
                                respondents to a Kos/Research
                                2000 poll said they thought
                                Obama wasn't born in the United
                                States, while 30 percent "weren't
                                sure." "Obama should be in the
                                Big House," Taitz shrieked to me,
                                "not the White House!"

                                When Obama announced health
                                care reform as the first major
                                initiative of his administration,
                                the conservative movement
                                activated a campaign of
                                demonization -- transformational
                                politics -- designed to turn Obama
                                into the "Other," making him
                                seem as unfamiliar, and therefore
                                as threatening, as possible. When
                                the president urged the Congress
                                to deliver a health care reform bill
                                in 2009, the Right staged a living
                                theater of political hatred,
                                 Obama's dream of bipartisanship
                                 transformed into a nightmarish
                                 version of "Marat/Sade." On
                                 September 12, 2009, tens of
                                 thousands of far-right activists
                                 belonging to a loose
                                 confederation of anti-government
                                 groups called the Tea Party

                               Washington's National Mall for a
                               giant protest against the Obama
                               health care plan. The date was
                               significant: Fox News's top-
                               ranked talk show host Glenn
                               Beck had declared the birth of the
                               "9-12 Project" to restore the sense
                               of unity -- and siege mentality --
                               that Americans experienced on
                               September 11, 2001. But this
                               time, Obama -- not Osama -- was
                               the enemy.
                               While covering the rally, I
                               witnessed sign after sign
                               declaring Obama a greater danger
                               to America's security than al-
                               Qaida; demonstrators held images
                               that juxtaposed Obama's face
                               with images of evildoers from
                               Hitler to Pol Pot to Bin Laden;
                               others carried signs questioning
                               Obama's status as a U.S. citizen.
                               "We can fight al-Qaida, we can't
                               kill Obama," said an aging
                               demonstrator. Another told me,
                               "Obama is the biggest Nazi in the
                                world," pointing to placards he
                                had fashioned depicting Obama
                                and House Majority Leader
                                Nancy Pelosi in SS outfits.
                                According to another activist,
                                Obama's agenda was similar to
                                Hitler's: "Hitler took over the
                                banking industry, did he not? And
                                Hitler had his own personal secret
                                service police. [The community-

                                extension of that."

                                The seemingly incongruous Tea
                                Party propaganda recalled signs
                                waved by right-wing Jewish
                                settlers during rallies against
                                Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
                                Rabin and his support of the
                                peace process, portraying him as
                                an SS officer and as the French
                                collaborator Marshall Petain. In
                                1995, amid the provocative
                                atmosphere, a young right-wing
                                Jewish zealot assassinated Rabin.

                               The Israeli tragedy was a
                               cautionary example of targeted
                               hatred leading to violence.

                               Members of the Tea Party
                               "Patriots" did not seem to care
                               that their rhetoric was irrational,
                               or that comparing Obama to
                               Hitler and Stalin was
                               contradictory and obviously
                               hyperbolic. Their motives were
                               entirely negative. By purging
                               government of the multicultural
                               evil that had seized power
                               through illicit means (several
                               activists told me they believed
                               ACORN helped Obama steal the
                               election), they were convinced
                               that a mythical golden American
                               yesteryear would return. They
                               had no interest in building
                               anything new or even articulating
                               an agenda, much less discussing
                               the merits of policies. The Tea
                               Party's primary concern was
                               cultural purification -- freedom
                               from, not freedom to. Against the
                               dark image of the president and
                               his liberal allies, Tea Party
                               activists defined themselves as
                               the children of light. The racial
                               subtext was always transparent.

                                The Tea Party's strategy rested on
                                a guerrilla campaign of chaos and
                                sabotage designed not only to
                                intimidate Democrats but also to
                                disorient independent voters who
                                might have supported health care
                                reform. The Tea Partiers were
                                convinced this would be an easy
                                feat, since they believed the
                                majority of the country was on

                                march organizers, told the crowd
                                that ABC News was reporting
                                that 1 million to 1.5 million

                               approximate figure of 60,000 to
                               70,000 protesters." Then Armey
                               led the crowd in a chant of
                               "Freedom works! Freedom
                               works!" Unknown to most of the
                               Tea Partiers, they were intoning
                               the name of a corporate-funded
                               Beltway advocacy group, not the
                               battle cry of Mel Gibson William
                               Wallace in Braveheart.

                               Contrary to its image as a
                               grassroots movement mobilized
                               to stifle the machinations of
                               Washington elites, the Tea Party
                               movement was the creation of a
                               constellation of industry-funded
                               conservative groups with close
                               Republican ties. The movement's
                               leading puppet-master was Dick
                               Armey, who directed resources
                               and talking points to the Tea
                               Party "Patriots" from his
                               Washington, D.C.-based
                               advocacy group, FreedomWorks.
                               Among the corporate clients of
                               Armey's lobbying firm, which he
                               was forced to leave as a result of
                               his involvement in the Tea
                               Parties, was the pharmaceutical
                               giant Bristol Myers Squibb, a
                               company with a clear interest in
                               defeating health care reform.
                               (Armey's other "real American"
                               clients included the Marxist terror
                               cult, People's Mojahedin of Iran,
                               which received funding and
                               assistance from Saddam Hussein

                               throughout the 1990's against
                               Iranian civilian targets.) Armey
                               collected a consulting fee of
                               $250,000 directly from
                               FreedomWorks and $300,000
                               from allied astroturf front groups.
                               FreedomWorks paid out much of
                               its money to an assortment of
                               Republican political consultants.

                                Sarah PalM was eager to be
                                crowned the Tea Party queen.
                                Just days after Obama's
                                inauguration, Palin abruptly quit
                                her job as Alaskan governor to
                                vie for the honor. PalM's motives
                                for quitting became clear when
                                she inked a lucrative deal to write
                                her political memoir Going
                                Rogue, signed on as a regular
                                contributor to Fox News, and
                                received $1 million an episode for
                                a reality show on cable television,
                                "Sarah Palin's Alaska." PalM's
                                book tour, which sent her through
                                Middle America in a luxuriously
                                outfitted bus, resembled both a
                                presidential campaign and a
                                traveling carnival.

                                Whether or not PalM intends to
                                run for president, her growing
                                media presence has magnified her
                                influence within the Republican
                                Party. Yet the ever-expanding
                                Palin phenomenon was greeted
                                with hostility by Republican
                                politicos desperately seeking to
                                expand the party's base after the
                                drubbing in 2008. Former
                                McCain campaign manager Steve
                                Schmidt warned that Palin's
                                nomination in 2012 would be
                                "catastrophic" for the GOP. His
                                doomsday prediction was backed
                                by an October Gallup poll
                                revealing her as one of the most
                                polarizing and unpopular political
                                figures in the country with a
                                disapproval rating of over 50
                                 percent. Unfortunately for
                                 Schmidt and other party
                                 pragmatists, those who approve
                                 of Palin represent the heartbeat of
                                 the Republican Party, its most
                                 fervent activists, and cannot be
                                 dissuaded from following her,
                                 even if she is leading the party off
                                 a cliff.

                                congressional election in New
                                York's heavily Republican 23rd
                                district was the first major test of
                                Palin's power. Along with a
                                parade of nationally recognized
                                conservatives, Palin endorsed
                                Doug Hoffman, an unknown far-
                                right third-party candidate closely
                                allied with the Tea Party, helping
                                to force a popular moderate
                                Republican politician, Dede
                                Scozzafava, from the race. In the
                                end, Palin's ideological purge in
                                upstate New York led to an
                                improbable Democratic victory,
                                the first in that district in more
                                than 100 years. After the disaster
                                Palin and her allies claimed
                                victory, insisting they had at least
                                hastened the purge of
                                ideologically impure Republicans
                                from the party. She went on to
                                endorse Rand Paul, the son of
                                right-wing libertarian Rep. Ron
                                Paul and a candidate in
                                Kentucky's GOP senatorial
                                primary, while Dick Cheney went
                                out of his way to endorse Rand's
                                regular Republican opponent,
                                Trey Grayson, the Kentucky
                                secretary of state.

                                Following the Tea Party script of
                                avoiding social issues like
                                abortion and gay marriage in
                                order to obscure the large
                                presence of the Christian Right
                                within the movement's ranks, the
                                self-described "hardcore pro-
                                lifer" Palin recast herself as a
                                libertarian concerned primarily
                                with issues of "economic
                                freedom." She claimed the
                                Democratic "cap and trade" plan
                                to limit carbon emissions would
                                harm the livelihood of blue-collar
                                workers, and she assailed health
                                care reform as a Trojan Horse for
                                "socialism" (though she admitted
                                her family "used to hustle over
                                the border" to take advantage of

                               Canada's single-payer health care
                               system). But no Palin attack had
                               as much effect as the one she
                               blasted out on her Facebook page
                               claiming the Obama health care
                               plan included a provision for
                               "death panels" that would
                               recommend euthanasia for
                               severely ill patients like her
                               Down syndrome-afflicted son,
                               Trig. With the click of a button,
                               Palin transformed the tone of the
                               health care debate from rancorous
                               to poisonous.

                               The source of Palin's "death
                               panels" smear was a practiced
                               propagandist, former New York
                               Lieutenant Governor Betsy
                               McCaughey. When President Bill
                               Clinton introduced health care
                               reform during his first term,
                               McCaughey falsely claimed in an
                               article published in the New
                               Republic and widely circulated by
                               Republicans, that the plan would
                               force consumers to drop their
                               private plans and buy into the
                               government's program (the article
                               would go on to win a National
                               Magazine Award and then be
                               retracted years later by the New
                               Republic's editors). Now she was
                               back in the spotlight, pushing a
                               rumor that would be voted by the
                               non-partisan fact-checking Web
                               site Politifact.com as "the lie of
                               2009." McCaughey's latest
                                innuendo was boosted by the cult
                                of political crank Lyndon
                                LaRouche, which mobilized to
                                push the rumor into the

                                In June 2009, one of LaRouche's

                                confronted Ezekiel Emanuel, the

                               4 program to kill the handicapped
                               through health care reform.
                               "President Obama has put in
                               place a reform apparatus reviving
                               the euthanasia of Hitler Germany
                               in 1939, that began the genocide
                               there," LaRouche staffer Anton
                               Chaitkin charged. Soon,
                               LaRouche's followers were on
                               street corners around the country
                               with posters depicting Obama
                               with a Hitler moustache. At a
                               town hall forum on health care
                               reform hosted by Democratic
                               Rep. Barney Frank, a LaRouche
                               follower waved one of the
                               Obama-as-Hitler posters and
                               demanded, "Why do you continue
                               to support a Nazi policy, as
                               Obama has expressly supported
                                this policy?"

                                Two months later, after Palin
                                whispered the rumor on
                                Facebook, prominent
                                conservatives from former
                                Speaker of the House Newt
                                Gingrich to ranking Senate
                                Finance Committee member
                                Charles Grassley parroted her
                                claims before audiences of
                                indignant Tea Partiers. Not to be
                                outdone, Glenn Beck devoted an
                                extended rant on his show to the
                                reality of death panels. Echoing
                                the LaRouche cultists, Beck
                                accused Ezekiel Emanuel of "the
                                devaluing of human life, putting a
                                price on each individual." He
                                thundered, "The death panel is
                                not a firing squad. Rationing is
                                 inevitable and they know it!"

                                The death panel rumor served a
                                variety of functions, all useful to
                                the movement, but not necessarily
                                to the Republican Party. Most
                                importantly, the rumor resonated
                                both with hard-core libertarians
                                who resented the very existence

                               Christian Right activists who
                               viewed the legalization of
                               abortion as a slippery slope to
                               government-sponsored
                               euthanasia. The hysteria it
                               engendered helped repair the rift
                               exposed by the Terri Schiavo
                               charade in 2005, when the
                               evangelical conservative James
                               Dobson publicly clashed with
                               Armey, the libertarian leader,
                               over the right of the government
                               to interfere in a private family
                               matter of life and death.

                                The slurring of Obama as a sort
                                of sleeper agent crypto-Muslim
                                helped bring the neoconservatives
                                back into the fray. The new neo-
                                con generation was led by Dick
                                Cheney's daughter, Liz, who
                                founded an anti-Obama advocacy
                                group, Keep America Safe, by
                                leveraging donations from pro-
                                Israel sources. Asked by CNN's
                                Larry King about the Birther
                                movement that was challenging
                                Obama's status as an American
                                citizen, Liz Cheney remarked,
                                "One of the reasons you see
                                people so concerned about this is
                                people are uncomfortable with

                                think, a president who seems so
                                reluctant to defend the nation
                                overseas." With the libertarians,
                                Christian Right, and the neo-cons
                                seated around the same table,
                                united in resentment of the alien
                                president, the conservative
                                 movement was whole again.

                               University of Colorado, have
                               demonstrated the connection
                               between fear of death and
                               intensification of conservative
                               attitudes. The findings help
                               explain the effectiveness of the
                               death panel rumor and
                               insinuations by conservative
                               figures that Obama was not truly
                               American and somehow
                               sympathetic to Islamic terrorists.
                               Indeed, these seemingly irrational
                               smears were guided by tactical
                               reasoning, calculated to agitate
                               voters with constant reminders of
                               their own mortality. Whether or
                               not Independents responded, the
                               rhetoric of death kept the Tea
                               Party crowd in a persistent state
                               of panic and rage, ensuring a
                               standing army ready to fan out to
                               rallies and town halls at the first
                               sign of liberal malfeasance.

                                Obama's first year in office was
                                marked by more than raucous
                                protests; there were several
                                disturbing murders committed by
                                far-right extremists. In April
                                2009, a 22-year-old neo-Nazi
                                wannabe named Richard
                                Poplawsi mowed down a SWAT
                                team of Pittsburgh cops, killing
                                three. Poplawski's best friend told
                                reporters the young killer "grew
                                angry recently over fears Obama
                                would outlaw guns." Later it was
                                discovered that Poplawski had
                                posted a video clip to a neo-Nazi
                                Web site portraying Fox's Glenn
                                Beck contemplating the existence
                                of concentration camps. (After a
                                characteristically thorough
                                investigation, Beck conceded
                                they were not real.) On another
                                occasion, the killer posted a video
                                promoting Tea Party rallies. A

                               shot Dr. George Tiller to death
                               while he prayed at his church in
                               Wichita, Kansas. Tiller was
                               declared fair game by the anti-
                               abortion movement because of
                               his role as Kansas's only late-term
                               abortion provider. During at least
                               28 episodes of Bill O'Reilly's
                               "O'Reilly Factor," O'Reilly had
                               referred to Tiller as "Tiller the
                               baby killer," a criminal guilty of
                               "Nazi stuff." "I wouldn't want to
                               be [Tiller] if there is a Judgment
                               Day," O'Reilly proclaimed.

                                In August 2009, a middle-aged
                                professional named George
                                Sodini walked into a health club
                                in suburban Pittsburgh and
                                gunned down three women. The
                                mainstream press explained
                                Sodini's motives away by homing
                                in on passages in his online
                                diaries describing his loneliness,
                                inability to convince women to
                                have sex with him, and descent
                                into chronic masturbation. Nearly
                                every major media outlet omitted
                                or ignored a long deranged entry
                                in which Sodini projected his
                                sexual frustration onto Obama,
                                whom he seemed to view as a
                                symbol of black male virility and
                                predation.

                                The day after Obama's election
                                victory, Sodini wrote: "Good luck
                                to Obama! He will be successful.
                                The liberal media LOVES him.
                                Amerika has chosen The Black
                                Man. Good! In light of this I got
                                ideas outside of Obama's plans
                                for the economy and such. Here it

                               In another posting to an anti-
                               Clinton forum in 1994, during the
                               height of the Republicans'
                               Whitewater investigation, Sodini
                               revealed that he had purchased a
                               bumper sticker reading, "Stop
                               Socialism, Impeach Clinton,"
                               from a National Review ad. A
                               year later, Sodini ranted on an
                               anti-government militia site, "I
                               am convinced that more drastic
                               action is required to bring the
                               country back to the Constitutional
                               order that it was 200 years ago. I
                               don't think any group of political
                               leaders will achieve this for us."
                               Whether or not Sodini's murder
                               spree was motivated by his
                               political passions, he was
                               pathologically death-driven and
                               fixated on the phantasmagoria of
                               right-wing imagery. In his final
                               diary entry, Sodini proclaimed,
                               "Death lives!"

                                More than any other media figure
                                of the Obama era, Glenn Beck
                                encouraged the campaign of
                                racial demonization and
                                conspiracy that consumed the Tea
                                Party "Patriots." During a
                                broadcast of "Fox and Friends,"
                                Beck opined that Obama "has
                                exposed himself over and over
                                and over again as a guy who has a
                                deep-seated hatred for white
                                people, or the white culture." As
                                evidence, Beck pointed to White
                                House green-jobs czar Van Jones,
                                an African American former
                                community organizer who was
                                eventually forced to resign as a
                                 direct result of Beck's crusade.
                                 From there, Beck targeted another
                                 black Obama adviser, Valerie
                                 Jarrett, highlighting her ties to
                                 ACORN while upholding her and
                                 Jones as evidence of Obama's

                               "socialist" agenda. In another
                               broadcast, Beck played an audio
                               clip of unidentified African
                               Americans referring to "Obama
                               money" as they collected welfare
                               checks in Detroit. Then he
                               showed footage of members of a
                               Kansas City-based youth group
                               practicing a step show, a
                               traditional African-American
                               group dance apparently
                               unfamiliar enough to Beck and
                               his transfixed audience that he
                               felt at liberty to claim the footage
                               as evidence that "Obama's SS"
                               was being trained across inner-
                               city America.

                                In September 2009, Beck
                                relentlessly targeted ACORN, the
                                Right's new favorite hobgoblin,
                                admitting that he intended to use
                                the poor people's advocacy group
                                to distract his viewers from the
                                health care debate. "Trust me,"
                                Beck said, "Everybody now says
                                they're going to be talking about
                                health care. I don't think so." (His
                                statement was reminiscent of
                                Rush Limbaugh's scandal-
                                mongering remark during the
                                early Clinton administration:
                                "Whitewater is about health
                                care.") Beck promptly cued up a
                                series of hidden camera videos
                                 shot by conservative youth
                                 activists James O'Keefe and
                                 Hannah Giles inside ACORN
                                 field offices. In the videos,
                                 O'Keefe baited African-American
                                 staffers into making statements
                                 explaining that Giles, who
                                 claimed she was a prostitute,
                                 could obtain low-income housing.
                                 O'Keefe edited in images of
                                 himself clad in an outlandish
                                 pimp costume to create the
                                 impression that he was dressed
                                 that way during the meetings with
                                 ACORN; however, Giles later
                                 admitted her partner had lied

                               about wearing his costume to
                               farther ineriminate ACORN. In
                               the end. ACORN was exonerated
                               of all criminal wrongdoing while
                               in a separate incident O'Keefe
                               was arrested and charged with a
                               federal crime after he and several
                               conservative pals disguised
                               themselves as telephone
                               repairmen and attempted to
                               wiretap phone lines in the office
                               of Senator Mary 'Landrieu of
                                Louisiana. Like Ryan Sorba,
                               O'Keefe and his posse were
                               movement cadres paid and
                               directed by well-funded
                                conservative outfits; O'Keefe had
                                been trained by the Leadership
                                Institute, the right-wing youth
                                Froup that nurtured leadinG, lights
                                like Jack Abriunoff, Karl Rove,
                                Ralph Reed, and Jeff Gannon.

                                While O'Keefe and his buddies
                                plea-bargained with prosecutors,
                                Beck basked in his formula for
                                success. His show earned the
                                hithest ratings at Fox News,
                                topping network franchises like
                                O'Reilly and Sean Hannity. In the
                                process. Beck's opinions became
                                firmly implanted in the nervous
                                systems of Tea Party activists.
                                "Glenn Beck has taught us
                                everything we know," a
                                demonstrator at the 9-12 rally told
                                Me. "He's opened our eyes to so
                                 much."

                                But unlike the right-wing radio
                                warhorses who helped usher in
                                Newt Gin<trich's Republican
                                counter-revolution of 1994, Beck
                                was not an authentic product of
                                the movement. When Rush
                                Limbaugh first began dominating
                                the AM airwaves, Beck was
                                mired in the world of mid-level
                                commercial radio, delivering
                                corny yarns about lesbians and

                                By night, as he has tirelessly
                                recounted, he medicated his
                                anxiety with cocaine and alcohol,

                                who called himself Bubba the
                                Love Sponge remarked to me
                                during a broadcast of his
                                nationally syndicated show.

                                  Like Dusty Rhodes, the pseudo-
                                  populist demagogue of Elia
                                  Kazan's 1957 film, A Face in the
                                  Crowd. Beck was a self-
                                  destructive drifter Who might
                                  have been crumpled up with a
                                  bottle of Mad Dog 20/20 in an
                                  alleyway or been locked away in

                                  him first. Beck was only able to
                                  stabilize his life when he made
                                  his escape from freedom.,
                                  marrying a conservative Mormon,
                                  converting to her religion, and
                                  transmuting his urge to abuse
                                  drugs into conservative radio
                                  diatribes. When Beck first broke
                                  into television On CNN's
                                  Headline News Channel, he
                                  struggled to articulate a coherent
                                  political world view. If he
                                  distinguished himself from other
                                  big-time conservative .hosts in
                                  any way, he did so through
                                  strained and often snide attempts
                                  at humor, remnants of his failed
                                  radio career. Nevertheless, with
                                  help from his liberal agent,
                                  Matthew Hiltzik, Beck snagged a
                                  primetime slot at Fox News in
                                  early 2009. Around this same
                                  time, Beck began promoting the
                                   work of an arcane Mormon
                                  conspiracy-peddler named W.

                               described as his political lodestar.
                               Suddenly, Beck had something
                               more to offer than irritable mental
                               gestures.

                               Thanks to Beck's designation of
                               Skousen's pseudohistorical tract
                               The 5000 Year Leap as "required
                               reading" on the Web site of his 9-
                               12 Project, and his promotion of
                               the book on his show, the
                               previously obscure Skousen.
                               became the Hidden imam of the
                               Tea Party movement. By the
                               summer of 2009, Skousen's Leap
                               was among the top 10 books on
                               Amazon.com and a fixture on
                               literature tables at Tea Party
                               gatherings. It went from selling a
                               puny couple of thousand copies in
                               2007 to selling over 200,000
                               copies in 2009. Just why the book
                               generated such an instant appeal
                               is difficult to understand. It is
                                little more than a slapdash of
                               quotes from the Founding
                                Fathers, often taken out of
                                context and deliberately
                                oversimplified, to explain why
                                America is the greatest nation in
                                history. in the process, Skousen
                                claims that church and state
                                separation is un-American, that
                                "coercive taxation" is communist,
                                and that marriage is the
                                underpinning of a free society.
                                Benjamin Franklin., who wrote at
                                 length on the merits of "amours"
                                 with "old women," and who
                                 famously solicited prostitutes and
                                 fathered a son of out of wedlock,
                                 was the ultimate authority
                                 Skousen quoted on the
                                 importance of marriage.

                                Though Skousen claims the
                                Founders as the world's foremost
                                source of eternal wisdom, he
                                buttressed his points with fringe
                                sources like the conspiracist

                               Illuminati. According. to Skousen,
                               Dodd claimed that "powerful
                               influences congregating in the
                               United States" like the
                               Rockefellers and the Rothschilds
                               had forced the United States into
                               World War I. Skousen published
                               Dodd's manifestoes in his obscure
                               journal Freemen's Digest, which
                               he founded for the express
                               purpose of propagating
                               conspiracies.

                               Skousen's paranoid politics were
                               an outgrowth of his participation.
                               in extreme anti-communist
                               groups during the 1950s. He
                               boasted of a close friendship with
                               then-FBI director J. Edgar
                               Hoover and said he provided him
                               with research on communist
                               plots, claims disputed by FBI
                               historians. (During a recent
                               interview. Skousen's son, Paul,
                               told me that contrary to rumors of
                               Hoover's cross-dressing and
                               homosexual dalliances, he would
                               set the top cop up on blind dates
                               with live women.) Skousen was
                               fired from his job as Salt Lake
                               City's police chief for, in the
                               words of the city's conservative
                               Mormon mayor, "conduct[ing]

                               exactly the same manner in which
                                the communists operate their
                                government." From there,
                                Skousen sailed off to the far
                                shores of the Right-peddling
                                conspiracy tracts like The Naked
                                Communist-, and earning
                                condemnation from his beloved
                                FBI, which accused him in an
                                internal memo of "promoting
                                [his] own anti-communism for
                                obvious financial purposes."

                                Skousen's vocal support for the
                                far-right John Birch Society's
                                claim that communists controlled

                                even the Church of Latter Day
                                Saints distanced itself from
                                Skousen and his conspiracy
                                theories. His work fell through
                                the margins and might have
                                disappeared entirely had Beck not
                                revived it, turning The 5000 Year

                                Party movement. Journalist
                                Alexander Zaitchik observed in
                                his authoritative profile of
                                Skousen on Salon.com that
                                Skousen's renewed influence
                                through Beck and the Tea Party
                                'suggests that the modern base of

                                Besides influencing Beck,
                                Skousen's teachings inspired one
                                of the Tea Party movement's most

                                met Mack in February at a far-

                                Montgomery, Alabama. On a
                                makeshift stage towed into the
                                middle of a rodeo arena by a
                                pickup truck, Mack recalled with
                                reverence his mentorship by
                                Skousen, who he said taught him
                                everything he needed to know
                                about the Constitution. Mack
                                urged his spellbound audience to
                                stockpile ammo and store food.
                                "If you control the food supply,"
                                Mack warned, "you control the
                                people. And that's the first step to
                                slavery."

                                local lawman who vowed to resist
                                the tyrannical federal
                                government. Along with a few
                                dozen former and active military
                                and law enforcement personnel,
                                Mack helped form a self-styled
                                Tea Party militia called the
                                Oathkeepers. Galvanized by their
                                fear of creeping socialism, the
                                Oathkeepers solemnly swore to
                                refuse tyrannical federal orders
                                such as cooperating with foreign
                                troops and forcing Americans
                                into concentration camps.
                                Because the group's members
                                trained for combat, the vow came
                                with suggestion of armed
                                resistance.

                                Besides Mack, the Oathkeepers
                                attracted a coterie of militia

                                The most well-established figure
                                was Mike Vanderboegh, a
                                longtime militia fanatic who
                                published a booklet in the mid-
                                1990s entitled Strategy and
                                Tactics for a Militia Civil War,

                                threat to the passage of health
                                care reform. Representative Bart
                                Stupak of Michigan had been in
                                office since 1993, placing him
                                among the senior leadership of
                                the so-called centrist Blue Dog
                                Democrats. When health care
                                reform was introduced in
                                Congress, Stupak became the
                                leader of an informal caucus of
                                anti-abortion Democrats, making
                                him the de facto swing vote on
                                the House version of the bill. By
                                extension, Stupak was the point
                                man in the campaign to ensure
                                that the bill would not allow
                                federal funding for abortion for
                                low-income women.

                                 But after close consultation with
                                 leaders of the U.S. Conference of
                                 Catholic Bishops, Stupak went a
                                 step further. He introduced a
                                 draconian amendment to block
                                 women from paying for abortions
                                 from even their own private
                                 insurance plans. The amendment,
                                 which passed the House but was
                                 shut down in the Senate, became
                                 a key sticking point in health care
                                 negotiations. 'He's a big hero
                                 now in the pro-life community,"
                                 former Bush Catholic issues
                                 adviser Deal Hudson told me in
                                 November 2009. "Thanks to him,
                                 this is the first time I can
                                 remember the pro-life Democrats
                                 having any power."

                                 To the chagrin of the
                                 Republicans, Stupak entertained
                                 offers of compromise from the
                                 Democratic leadership.
                                 According to Hudson, the
                                 Catholic Bishops were keen to
                                 see health care reform pass, but
                                 only if the bill contained a clear
                                 provision forbidding patients
                                 from spending federal money on
                                 abortion. Finally, in March, after
                                 pressure from House Majority

                                agreed to sign an executive order
                                forbidding the federal funding of
                                abortion. Stupak had been
                                mollified. Now he and his anti-
                                abortion caucus pledged to
                                deliver the swing votes the
                                Democrats needed to pass the
                                bill. As soon as reports seeped out
                                declaring the imminent passage
                                of health care reform, major
                                right-wing blogs like
                                RedState.org churned out virulent
                                denunciations of Stupak, calling
                                him a traitor and sellout. The blog
                                comment sections filled up with
                                dozens of diatribes referring to
                                Stupak in language previously

                                On March 20, thousands of Tea
                                Party activists surrounded the
                                Capitol's Longworth Building in
                                expectation of Obama's pep talk
                                to the House Democrats and the
                                health care vote. Democratic
                                Representative john Lewis, a
                                hero of the civil rights movement,
                                and Representative Barney Frank,
                                the first openly gay member of
                                Congress, passed through the
                                crowd on their way inside the

                                barked at Lewis. Another called
                                Frank a "faggot," eliciting
                                laughter and cheers from nearby
                                protesters. Meanwhile, as another
                                African-American Democrat,
                                Representative Emanuel Cleaver,
                                ascended the Capitol steps, a
                                protester who had been screaming
                                at Lewis and Frank spat on his
                                face.

                                 With the demonstration carried
                                 on into the night, cries of "Kill

                                 violence. "I would gladly stand

                               uniform proclaimed in front of an
                               amateur videographer, pointing
                               toward the Capitol. "You haven't
                               heard the last of me!"

                               The next day, Republican
                               members of Congress emerged
                               from the Longworth Building to
                               salute the Tea Partiers. The
                               demonstrators cheered wildly for
                               their proxies on the inside.
                               Finally, after hours of
                               impassioned speeches on the
                               House floor, the bill passed. But
                               the drama was hardly over.

                                Republican Representative Joe
                                Pitts, an anti-abortion Catholic
                                who co-authored Stupak's
                                original amendment, demanded a
                                motion to bring it back to the
                                floor for a vote, a transparent
                                exercise in grandstanding that
                                was certain to fail. In response,
                                Stupak rushed to the podium with
                                a stinging rebuke to Pitts and the
                                Republicans. "The motion to
                                commit does not support life,"
                                Stupak declared. "It is the
                                Democrats who have stood up...."
                                Heckling from the Republican
                                side interrupted his statement. As
                                Stupak looked around the House
                                chamber, Rep. Randy
                                Neugebauer, a right-wing
                                Republican from Texas who
                                openly supported the Birther
                                movement, began shouting at him
                                from the backbench, "Baby
                                killer!" Other Republicans joined
                                in, parroting base insults.

                                While the Republicans sank their
                                heads in defeat, some more
                                militant devotees of the Tea Party
                                movement called for a right-wing
                                Kristallnacht. "If you wish to

                                her party cannot fail to hear,
