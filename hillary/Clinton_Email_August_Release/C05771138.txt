As you have probably figured out by now, it's not ready. We were prepared to send you something rough, but it's just
not in a state where it makes sense for you to engage. I will call Jim Hoge tomorrow and get another week of need be;
Lissa is going to take over the drafting tomorrow with the aim of getting you a draft by late afternoon that you can really
take some time with; we will then take your comments Friday or Sat (if you need more time) and then not bother you
again until we have a final. I'm sorry, but it is most important that this be good.
