I get back the morning of February 9 and will be in the office that afternoon. I'll email you and Lona a copy of my
schedule. Walter Douglas and Dan Sreebney have been working with me on Haiti. Walter is in California for Victoria
DeLongh's funeral and will be back in the office Tuesday. He has been working closely with Dan Smith on the Haiti
initiative. Let me know if there is anything you need me to do from here.

- VEJA MAGAZINE, BRAZIL (Jan. 25, headline of a two-page article showing U.S. servicemen walking in front of destroyed
buildings in Port-au-Prince): "Better with them, impossible without."




--CHOSUN ILBO NEWSPAPER, KOREA (Jan. 25): U.S. involvement in overseas natural disasters is a 40-year-long
humanitarian tradition... In a disaster-stricken area, the military is more systematic and effective in carrying out a relief
operation than any other group."




-- EXPRESSO NEWSPAPER, PORTUGAL (Jan. 24): "In critical moments of the history of mankind, over the last 100 years,
the United States is, in fact, the indispensable nation. Sometimes for bad reasons and, other times, as in Haiti, for good
reasons."
