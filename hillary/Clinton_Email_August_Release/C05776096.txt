Subject: H: Several observations on the Israeli raid. Sid

First observation: Bibi's Entebbe in reverse. The father, Benzion Netanyahu; 100 years old, secretary to Jabotinsky, and
denounced as too radical by Begin, adored his son Yoni, heroically killed at Entebbe. Benyamin has never measured up.
Benzion has constantly criticized him in public for his deviations from the doctrine of Greater Israel. Bibi desperately
seeks his father's approbation and can never equal his dead brother. See Benzion's most recent scathing undermining of
his son Bibi and Bibi's tearful tribute to his brother just last month. The raid on the ship to Gaza resembles the raid on
Entebbe, except that there are no hostages, no guns, it's not in Africa, and it's a fiasco; otherwise, it's Entebbe. (Then,
there's Ehud Barak reliving his youth as a raider killing Palestinians in Lebanon, a feat memorialized in Spielberg's film,
Munich. Ultimately, it didn't work out well that time either. The film captures the moral quandaries, which appear to
have escaped the participants.) Further observation: The international press will inquire whether the Obama
administration gave a wink or nod as the Bush administration did for the Lebanon and Gaza incursions. Be prepared.
Further: Of course, the consequences for US foreign policy and national security are negative across the board: from the
analogy of the North Korean ship sinking and the Chinese posture to support for Iranian sanctions, etc., etc. Did the
Israelis not hear Petraeus's testimony?
Further: Of course, whatever the outcome of such a raid, one of the inevitable ones would be the death of the peace
process, such as it is, on the very eve of Bibi's scheduled visit to Obama, which would have been, under any
circumstance, in light of the raid, profoundly humiliating for the president. Or are the Israelis bone stupid? I don't think
so.
Cheers,
Sid




Like Father, Like Son? Netanyahu's Father Says Son Not Serious About Two-State Solution.

 In a controversial interview with Israel's Channel II News, the father of Prime Minister Netanyahu, Professor Benzion
 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzion_Netanyahu > Netanyahu, says that his son does not support a Palestinian state.
 The elder Netanyahu, claims that the prime Minister told him he deliberately placed impossible conditions before the
 Palestinians.
 Here are excerpts from the interview <http://www.mako.co.il/news-military/politics/Article-
 77cd5b4ae4b5221006.htm&sCh=3d385dd2dd5d4110&pld=978777604> . When asked if his son really changed his
•position concerning a Palestinian state, the 100 year-old historian unequivocally answered: (translation mine)

       "He does not support. He supports such conditions that they (the Arabs) will never accept it. That is what I heard
from him. I didn't propose these conditions, he did. They will never accept these conditions. Not one of them."

When asked about his own personal opinion about a Palestinian state, the senior Netanyahu stated:

         Herzl <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Herzl > and Nordau <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Nordau>
(fathers of zionist movement) did not labor to create a Palestinian state. This land is Jewish land and not a land for the
Arabs. There is no place here for Arabs, and there wont be a place here for the Arabs. They will never agree to the
conditions.

Netanyahu Visits Grave of Brother Who Fell in Entebbe Rescue



by Tzvi Ben Gedalyahu
Follow Israel news on Twitter <http://twitter.com/IsraelNewsStory> and Facebook
<http://www.facebook.com/pages/IsraelNationalNews/102510354100> .

On Saturday night, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu visited the grave of his brother Yoni, who fell during the daring
rescue of hijacked Israelis in Entebbe <http://www.yoni.org.il/en/jonathan.php >, Uganda in 1976.

<http://info.a7.org/php_en/c.php?b=1816&z=17&clientid=1352&dest=http://www.bneiaish.com >
He and his wife Sarah decided to go to the gravesite on Mount Herzl 24 hours before the beginning of Remembrance
Day for Fallen Soldiers in order to prevent security tie-ups for thousands of other Israelis who will visit the cemetery
Sunday night and Monday.
The Netanyahus were moved emotionally after seeing for the first time a commemorative decoration that the IDF
carved into the gravestone of Yoni, who led the rescue operation and was the only soldier to die in the maneuver. One
of his less known heroic deeds is his saving a soldier from across Syrian lines in the Yom Kippur War in 1973.
Sirens will sound throughout Israel for one minute at 8 p.m. (1 p.m. EDT) Sunday night to mark the beginning of
Memorial Day for 22,682 Fallen Soldiers and 2,431 victims
<http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/137050> of Arab terrorist attacks following the re-
establishment of the State of Israel after 2,000 years. Another 1,500 civilians were killed between 1860 and the 1948
War for Independence, when seven Arab nations attacked the fledging, newly declared state just three years after the
Holocaust ended.
On Monday morning, a two-minute siren will sound at 11 a.m. (4 a.m. EDT). (IsraelNationalNews.com )
