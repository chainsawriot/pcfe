Thanks for the chat yesterday, Hillary. With Martin's and Bruce Jones's help, I'm working on
that one. Will get back to you.
On a very different matter—and that's why I'm cc'ing Cheryl and Jake—at some point when
it's appropriate and convenient, I'd welcome a chance to give you—either directly or indirectly
via C and/or J—a strongly held (and widely shared) view about the issue of UN leadership and
the timetable therefore. Zero rush.
   Hope it's a genuine weekend for you (whatever that means, grading on curve).
