Either works for me-- I am working through various sets of line edits right now. I can get a new draft out by
4pm-- depends on how much time you want to review before we talk.

 I agree with Dan about the ornament problem. The draft needs refinement not re-working. And a call is a great
 idea. I am just getting off a plane but could be available any time after 4 pm or so if that works for you.

 The latest draft is getting closer. And I agree w Dan that we have to be careful not to topple the tree w too
 many ornaments. That said, I'd like to have a call w you (and anyone else who you think should be on) this
 afternoon or evening to raise a few points. I'm copying Lona and Huma so they can help schedule it. Thanks
 for all your good work.
