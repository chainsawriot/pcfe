Subject: (AP) Egyptians riot, burn cars, claiming vote fraud

ALEXANDRIA (AP) - Protesters set fire to cars, tires and two polling stations, clashing with police firing tear gas in riots
that erupted around Egypt on November 29 over allegations the ruling party carried out widespread fraud to sweep
parliamentary elections.
   The country's most powerful opposition movement, the Islamic fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood, acknowledged
that its lawmakers may be all but completely swept out of parliament by what it and other called rampant rigging.
   That's a significant blow to the group, which held 88 seats, a fifth, of the outgoing parliament, and it is widely believed
that it was the government goal to drive out its only real rival's lawmakers. The election showed the Brotherhood's
limited options after repeated crackdowns in past years, including the arrest of some 1,400 of its activists in the weeks
ahead of the vote.
