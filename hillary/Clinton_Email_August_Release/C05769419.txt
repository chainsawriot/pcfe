This document in text below is coming up the line to you as material for your trip. This is separate (but related) to what
we discussed earlier today. This focuses on the MDTF, using the tsunami model as a guide.

I also have tasked Jean-Louis to put together a think piece for this evening that we can look at re: the larger issue of
ensuring efficient, effective coordination of: bi-lateral donors investment, MDTF, and private fund/NGO efforts that all
must come together in a coherent fashion. Of not in this memo is fact that in tsunami, there was a GOI reconstruction
plan




See below on the Mu It-Donor Trust Fund

INFORMATION MEMO FOR THE SECRETARY

From: C — Cheryl Mills
Re: Creation of a Multidonor Reconstruction Fund (MDF) for Haiti

This memo provides a summary of key issues related to the creation of a multidonor
reconstruction fund for Haiti (MDF), incorporating lessons learned from reconstruction efforts
following the 2004 tsunami.

Lessons from Aceh:

• MDFs encourage greater donor participation: Smaller donors joined the Aceh fund
  because they wished to support reconstruction efforts but lacked independent capacity and
  often did not have strong views on how to pursue reconstruction. They wanted the Bank to
  assume fiduciary responsibilities for the funds in a high-risk environment, and also to take a
  lead in ensuring that the funds go to prioritized activities.

• Develop an outreach strategy: The Aceh MDF Secretariat developed an Outreach Strategy
  that includes regular radio talk shows, field visits to meet and discuss with beneficiaries, and
  communication through advertisements as well as a telephone hotline.

• Engage the government in dialogue: The Aceh MDF received praise for engaging the GoI
  in policy dialogue. The MDF was an entry point for engaging on conditions for
  sustainability, relevance and impact.

• Appointment on Envoy: The appointment of a high-profile UN Special Envoy (former
  President Clinton) increased the availability of funding and willingness of international
  agencies to try new approaches. It also could provide one forum for coordination among
  donors, if the Envoy's office is adequately supported.

•    Disaster prevention: The tsunami underscored the critical role of disaster prevention in
    "building back better." It is difficult to overemphasize the importance of embedding risk
    reduction into recovery, especially in Haiti, where natural disasters have caused enormous
    human suffering.

• Coordinate proliferating aid agencies: Large numbers of both public and private aid
  agencies are likely be active in Haiti for some time. It is important to develop effective
  coordinating mechanisms and work to ensure that agencies bring actual expertise to the
  country, reduce turnover of international staff, and seek staff with appropriate language
  skills.

• Authoritative Assessment: Authoritative joint assessments involving the UN, the Red
  Cross, and national governments could have a beneficial impact on the decision making
  process and ensure broad buy-in.

Peter:
With edits in track changes. Most are self-explanatory, but call if you have questions — I'm in
the office.
I've also made two marginal comments that you should consider.
Best,
Eric
