Jan and Nancy:

As we are winding down the first year for Hillary, I wanted to reach out and say a belated but sincere thank you
for all the work you put in to get us off to a great start with staffing her team.

I am sure as you look across it you see a number of the faces you recommended, all of whom are doing
yeomen's work given the challenges this administration faces in foreign policy.

A special thank you as well for Margaret. She has been the gift that keeps on giving (indeed she is focused now
on ensuring USAID has the team it needs to assist Hillary both in revitalizing the agencyand producing the
development outcomes that will last for a lifetime).

I hope you have a great holiday season — I know there are many who will be giving thanks for you being among
their blessings — I just wanted to add my voice.

best.
