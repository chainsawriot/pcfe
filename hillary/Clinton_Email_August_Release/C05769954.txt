The Runaway General
Stanley McChrystal, Obama's top commander in Afghanistan,
has seized control of the war by never taking his eye off the
real enemy: The wimps in the White House

By Michael Hastings

This article originally appeared in RS 1108/1109 from July 8-22, 2010.

'Howed I get screwed into going to this dinner?" demands Gen. Stanley McChrystal. It's a Thursday night in mid-April,
and the commander of all U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan is sitting in a four-star suite at the HOtel Westminster in
Paris. He's in France to sell his new war strategy to our NATO allies — to keep up the fiction, in essence, that we actually
have allies. Since McChrystal took over a year ago, the Afghan war has become the exclusive property of the United
States. Opposition to the war has already toppled the Dutch government, forced the resignation of Germany's president
and sparked both Canada and the Netherlands to announce the withdrawal of their 4,500 troops. McChrystal is in Paris to
keep the French, who have lost more than 40 soldiers in Afghanistan, from going all wobbly on him.
"The dinner comes with the position, sir," says his chief of staff, Col. Charlie Flynn.
McChrystal turns sharply in his chair.
"Hey, Charlie," he asks, "does this come with the position?"
McChrystal gives him the middle finger.


The general stands and looks around the suite that his traveling staff of 10 has converted into a full-scale operations
center. The tables are crowded with silver Panasonic Toughbooks, and blue cables crisscross the hotel's thick carpet,
hooked up to satellite dishes to provide encrypted phone and e-mail communications. Dressed in off-the-rack civilian
casual — blue tie, button-down shirt, dress slacks — McChrystal is way out of his comfort zone. Paris, as one of his
advisers says, is the "most anti-McChrystal city you can imagine." The general hates fancy restaurants, rejecting any
place with candles on the tables as too "Gucci." He prefers Bud Light Lime (his favorite beer) to Bordeaux, Talladega
Nights (his favorite movie) to Jean-Luc Godard. Besides, the public eye has never been a place where McChrystal felt
comfortable: Before President Obama put him in charge of the war in Afghanistan, he spent five years running the
Pentagon's most secretive black ops.
 "What's the update on the Kandahar bombing?" McChrystal asks Flynn. The city has been rocked by two massive car
bombs in the past day alone, calling into question the general's assurances that he can wrest it from the Taliban.
"We have two KIAs, but that hasn't been confirmed," Flynn says.
McChrystal takes a final look around the suite. At 55, he is gaunt and lean, not unlike an older version of Christian Bale in
Rescue Dawn. His slate-blue eyes have the unsettling ability to drill down when they lock on you. If you've fucked up or
disappointed him, they can destroy your soul without the need for him to raise his voice.


"I'd rather have my ass kicked by a roomful of people than go out to this dinner," McChrystal says.
He pauses a beat.
"Unfortunately," he adds, "no one in this room could do it."
With that, he's out the door.
"Who's he going to dinner with?" I ask one of his aides.
"Some French minister," the aide tells me. "It's fucking gay."

The next morning, McChrystal and his team gather to prepare for a speech he is giving at the Ecole Militaire, a French
military academy. The general prides himself on being sharper and ballsier than anyone else, but his brashness comes
with a price: Although McChrystal has been in charge of the war for only a year, in that short time he has managed to piss
off almost everyone with a stake in the conflict. Last fall, during the question-and-answer session following a speech he
gave in London, McChrystal dismissed the counterterrorism strategy being advocated by Vice President Joe Biden as
"shortsighted," saying it would lead to a state of "Chaos-istan." The remarks earned him a smackdown from the president
himself, who summoned the general to a terse private meeting aboard Air Force One. The message to McChrystal
seemed clear: Shut the fuck up, and keep a lower profile
Now, flipping through printout cards of his speech in Paris, McChrystal wonders aloud what Biden question he might get
today, and how he should respond. "I never know what's going to pop out until I'm up there, that's the problem," he says.
Then, unable to help themselves, he and his staff imagine the general dismissing the vice president with a good one-
liner.
"Are you asking about Vice President Biden?" McChrystal says with a laugh. "Who's that?"
"Biden?" suggests a top adviser. "Did you say: Bite Me?"

When Barack Obama entered the Oval Office, he immediately set out to deliver on his most important campaign
promise on foreign policy: to refocus the war in Afghanistan on what led us to invade in the first place. "I want the
American people to understand," he announced in March 2009. "We have a clear and focused goal: to disrupt, dismantle
and defeat Al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan." He ordered another 21,000 troops to Kabul, the largest increase since
the war began in 2001. Taking the advice of both the Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he also fired Gen. David
McKiernan — then the U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan — and replaced him with a man he didn't know and had
met only briefly: Gen. Stanley McChrystal. It was the first time a top general had been relieved from duty during wartime in
more than 50 years, since Harry Truman fired Gen. Douglas MacArthur at the height of the Korean War.
Even though he had voted for Obama, McChrystal and his new commander in chief failed from the outset to connect. The
general first encountered Obama a week after he took office, when the president met with a dozen senior military officials
in a room at the Pentagon known as the Tank. According to sources familiar with the meeting, McChrystal thought Obama
looked "uncomfortable and intimidated" by the roomful of military brass. Their first one-on-one meeting took place in the
Oval Office four months later, after McChrystal got the Afghanistan job, and it didn't go much better. "It was a 10-minute
photo op," says an adviser to McChrystal. "Obama clearly didn't know anything about him, who he was. Here's the guy
who's going to run his fucking war, but he didn't seem very engaged. The Boss was pretty disappointed."
From the start, McChrystal was determined to place his personal stamp on Afghanistan, to use it as a laboratory for a
controversial military strategy known as counterinsurgency. COIN, as the theory is known, is the new gospel of the
Pentagon brass, a doctrine that attempts to square the military's preference for high-tech violence with the demands of
fighting protracted wars in failed states. COIN calls for sending huge numbers of ground troops to not only destroy the
enemy, but to live among the civilian population and slowly rebuild, or build from scratch, another nation's government — a
process that even its staunchest advocates admit requires years, if not decades, to achieve. The theory essentially
rebrands the military, expanding its authority (and its funding) to encompass the diplomatic and political sides of warfare:
Think the Green Berets as an armed Peace Corps. In 2006, after Gen. David Petraeus beta-tested the theory during his
"surge" in Iraq, it quickly gained a hardcore following of think-tankers, journalists, military officers and civilian officials.
Nicknamed "COINdinistas" for their cultish zeal, this influential cadre believed the doctrine would be the perfect solution
for Afghanistan. All they needed was a general with enough charisma and political savvy to implement it.
As McChrystal leaned on Obama to ramp up the war, he did it with the same fearlessness he used to track down terrorists
in Iraq: Figure out how your enemy operates, be faster and more ruthless than everybody else, then take the fuckers out.
After arriving in Afghanistan last June, the general conducted his own policy review, ordered up by Defense Secretary
Robert Gates. The now-infamous report was leaked to the press, and its conclusion was dire: If we didn't send another
40,000 troops — swelling the number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan by nearly half — we were in danger of "mission failure."
 The White House was furious. McChrystal, they felt, was trying to bully Obama, opening him up to charges of being weak
 on national security unless he did what the general wanted. It was Obama versus the Pentagon, and the Pentagon was
 determined to kick the president's ass.


Last fall, with his top general calling for more troops, Obama launched a three-month review to re-evaluate the strategy in
Afghanistan. "I found that time painful," McChrystal tells me in one of several lengthy interviews. "I was selling an
unsellable position." For the general, it was a crash course in Beltway politics — a battle that pitted him against
experienced Washington insiders like Vice President Biden, who argued that a prolonged counterinsurgency campaign in
Afghanistan would plunge America into a military quagmire without weakening international terrorist networks. "The entire
COIN strategy is a fraud perpetuated on the American people," says Douglas Macgregor, a retired colonel and leading
critic of counterinsurgency who attended West Point with McChrystal. "The idea that we are going to spend a trillion
dollars to reshape the culture of the Islamic world is utter nonsense.
In the end, however, McChrystal got almost exactly what he wanted. On December 1st, in a speech at West Point, the
president laid out all the reasons why fighting the war in Afghanistan is a bad idea: It's expensive; we're in an economic
crisis; a decade-long commitment would sap American power; Al Qaeda has shifted its base of operations to Pakistan.

Then, without ever using the words "victory" or "win," Obama announced that he would send an additional 30,000 troops
to Afghanistan, almost as many as McChrystal had requested. The president had thrown his weight, however hesitantly,
behind the counterinsurgency crowd.
Today, as McChrystal gears up for an offensive in southern Afghanistan, the prospects for any kind of success look bleak.
In June, the death toll for U.S. troops passed 1,000, and the number of IEDs has doubled. Spending hundreds of billions
of dollars on the fifth-poorest country on earth has failed to win over the civilian population, whose attitude toward U.S.
troops ranges from intensely wary to openly hostile. Thetiggest military operation of the year — a ferocious offensive that
began in February to retake the southern town of Marja — continues to drag on, prompting McChrystal himself to refer to it
as a "bleeding ulcer." In June, Afghanistan officially outpaced Vietnam as the longest war in American history — and
Obama has quietly begun to back away from the deadline he set for withdrawing U.S. troops in July of next year. The
president finds himself stuck in something even more insane than a quagmire: a quagmire he knowingly walked into, even
though it's precisely the kind of gigantic, mind-numbing, multigenerational nation-building project he explicitly said he
didn't want.
Even those who support McChrystal and his strategy of counterinsurgency know that whatever the general manages to
accomplish in Afghanistan, it's going to look more like Vietnam than Desert Storm. "It's not going to look like a win, smell
like a win or taste like a win," says Maj. Gen. Bill Mayville, who serves as chief of operations for McChrystal. "This is going
to end in an argument."

The night after his speech in Paris, McChrystal and his staff head to Kitty O'Shea's, an Irish pub catering to tourists,
around the corner from the hotel. His wife, Annie, has joined him for a rare visit: Since the Iraq War began in 2003, she
has seen her husband less than 30 days a year. Though it is his and Annie's 33rd wedding anniversary, McChrystal has
invited his inner circle along for dinner and drinks at the "least Gucci" place his staff could find. His wife isn't surprised.
"He once took me to a Jack in the Box when I was dressed in formalwear," she says with a laugh.
The general's staff is a handpicked collection of killers, spies, geniuses, patriots, political operators and outright maniacs.
There's a former head of British Special Forces, two Navy Seals, an Afghan Special Forces commando, a lawyer, two
fighter pilots and at least two dozen combat veterans and counterinsurgency experts. They jokingly refer to themselves as
Team America, taking the name from the South Park-esque sendup of military cluelessness, and they pride themselves
on their can-do attitude and their disdain for authority. After arriving in Kabul last summer, Team America set about
changing the culture of the International Security Assistance Force, as the NATO-led mission is known. (U.S. soldiers had
taken to deriding ISAF as short for "I Suck at Fighting" or "In Sandals and Flip-Flops.") McChrystal banned alcohol on
base, kicked out Burger King and other symbols of American excess, expanded the morning briefing to include thousands
of officers and refashioned the command center into a Situational Awareness Room, a free-flowing information hub
modeled after Mayor Mike Bloomberg's offices in New York. He also set a manic pace for his staff, becoming legendary
for sleeping four hours a night, running seven miles each morning, and eating one meal a day. (In the month I spend
around the general, I witness him eating only once.) It's a kind of superhuman narrative that has built up around him, a
staple in almost every media profile, as if the ability to go without sleep and food translates into the possibility of a man
single-handedly winning the war.
By midnight at Kitty O'Shea's, much of Team America is completely shitfaced. Two officers do an Irish jig mixed with steps
from a traditional Afghan wedding dance, while McChrystal's top advisers lock arms and sing a slurred song of their own
invention. "Afghanistan!" they bellow. "Afghanistan!" They call it their Afghanistan song.
McChrystal steps away from the circle, observing his team. "All these men," he tells me. "I'd die for them. And they'd die
for me."
The assembled men may look and sound like a bunch of combat veterans letting off steam, but in fact this tight-knit group
represents the most powerful force shaping U.S. policy in Afghanistan. While McChrystal and his men are in indisputable
command of all military aspects of the war, there is no equivalent position on the diplomatic or political side. Instead, an
assortment of administration players compete over the Afghan portfolio: U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry, Special
Representative to Afghanistan Richard Holbrooke, National Security Advisor Jim Jones and Secretary of State Hillary
 Clinton, not to mention 40 or so other coalition ambassadors and a host of talking heads who try to insert themselves into
 the mess, from John Kerry to John McCain. This diplomatic incoherence has effectively allowed McChrystal's team to call
 the shots and hampered efforts to build a stable and credible government in Afghanistan. "It jeopardizes the mission,"
 says Stephen Biddle, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who supports McChrystal. "The military cannot
 by itself create governance reform."
 Part of the problem is structural: The Defense Department budget exceeds $600 billion a year, while the State
 Department receives only $50 billion. But part of the problem is personal: In private, Team McChrystal likes to talk shit
 about many of Obama's top people on the diplomatic side. One aide calls Jim Jones, a retired four-star general and
 veteran of the Cold War, a "clown" who remains "stuck in 1985." Politicians like McCain and Kerry, says another aide,
 "turn up, have a meeting with Karzai, criticize him at the airport press conference, then get back for the Sunday talk
 shows. Frankly, it's not very helpful." Only Hillary Clinton receives good reviews from McChrystal's inner circle. "Hillary
 had Stan's back during the strategic review," says an adviser. "She said, 'If Stan wants it, give him what he needs.'"
 McChrystal reserves special skepticism for Holbrooke, the official in charge of reintegrating the Taliban. "The Boss says
 he's like a wounded animal," says a member of the general's team. "Holbrooke keeps hearing rumors that he's going to

get fired, so that makes him dangerous. He's a brilliant guy, but he just comes in, pulls on a lever, whatever he can grasp
onto. But this is COIN, and you can't just have someone yanking on shit."

At one point on his trip to Paris, McChrystal checks his BlackBerry. "Oh, not another e-mail from Holbrooke," he groans. "I
don't even want to open it." He clicks on the message and reads the salutation out loud, then stuffs the BladkBerry back in
his pocket, not bothering to conceal his annoyance.
"Make sure you don't get any of that on your leg," an aide jokes, referring to the e-mail.

By far the most crucial — and strained — relationship is between McChrystal and Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador.
According to those close to the two men, Eikenberry — a retired three-star general who served in Afghanistan in 2002 and
2005 — can't stand that his former subordinate is now calling the shots. He's also furious that McChrystal, backed by
NATO's allies, refused to put Eikenberry in the pivotal role of viceroy in Afghanistan, which would have made him the
diplomatic equivalent of the general. The job instead went to British Ambassador Mark Sedwill — a move that effectively
increased McChrystal's influence over diplomacy by shutting out a powerful rival. "In reality, that position needs to be filled
by an American for it to have weight," says a U.S. official familiar with the negotiations.
The relationship was further strained in January, when a classified cable that Eikenberry wrote was leaked to The New
York Times. The cable was as scathing as it was prescient. The ambassador offered a brutal critique of McChrystal's
strategy, dismissed President Hamid Karzai as "not an adequate strategic partner," and cast doubt on whether the
counterinsurgency plan would be "sufficient" to deal with Al Qaeda. "We will become more deeply engaged here with no
way to extricate ourselves," Eikenberry warned, "short of allowing the country to descend again into lawlessness and
chaos."
McChrystal and his team were blindsided by the cable. "I like Karl, I've known him for years, but they'd never said
anything like that to us before," says McChrystal, who adds that he felt "betrayed" by the leak. "Here's one that covers his
flank for the history books. Now if we fail, they can say, 'I told you so.'"
The most striking example of McChrystal's usurpation of diplomatic policy is his handling of Karzai. It is McChrystal, not
diplomats like Eikenberry or Holbrooke, who enjoys the best relationship with the man America is relying on to lead
Afghanistan. The doctrine of counterinsurgency requires a credible government, and since Karzai is not considered
credible by his own people, McChrystal has worked hard to make him so. Over the past few months, he has accompanied
the president on more than 10 trips around the country, standing beside him at political meetings, or shuras, in Kandahar.
In February, the day before the doomed offensive in Marja, McChrystal even drove over to the president's palace to get
him to sign off on what would be the largest military operation of the year. Karzai's staff, however, insisted that the
president was sleeping off a cold and could not be disturbed. After several hours of haggling, McChrystal finally enlisted
the aid of Afghanistan's defense minister, who persuaded Karzai's people to wake the president from his nap.
This is one of the central flaws with McChrystal's counterinsurgency strategy: The need to build a credible government
puts us at the mercy of whatever tin-pot leader we've backed — a danger that Eikenberry explicitly warned about in his
cable. Even Team McChrystal privately acknowledges that Karzai is a less-than-ideal partner. "He's been locked up in his
palace the past year," laments one of the general's top advisers. At times, Karzai himself has actively undermined
McChrystal's desire to put him in charge. During a recent visit to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Karzai met three U.S.
 soldiers who had been wounded in Uruzgan province. "General," he called out to McChrystal, "I didn't even know we were
 fighting in Uruzgan!"

Growing up as a military brat, McChrystal exhibited the mixture of brilliance and cockiness that would follow him
throughout his career. His father fought in Korea and Vietnam, retiring as a two-star general, and his four brothers all
joined the armed services. Moving around to different bases, McChrystal took solace in baseball, a sport in which he
made no pretense of hiding his superiority: In Little League, he would call out strikes to the crowd before whipping a
fastball down the middle.
McChrystal entered West Point in 1972, when the U.S. military was close to its all-time low in popularity. His class was the
last to graduate before the academy started to admit women. The "Prison on the Hudson," as it was known then, was a
potent mix of testosterone, hooliganism and reactionary patriotism. Cadets repeatedly trashed the mess hall in food fights,
and birthdays were celebrated with a tradition called "rat fucking," which often left the birthday boy outside in the snow or
mud, covered in shaving cream. "It was pretty out of control," says Lt. Gen. David Barno, a classmate who went on to
 serve as the top commander in Afghanistan from 2003 to 2005. The class, filled with what Barno calls "huge talent" and
"wild-eyed teenagers with a strong sense of idealism," also produced Gen. Ray Odierno, the current commander of U.S.
 forces in Iraq.
 The son of a general, McChrystal was also a ringleader of the campus dissidents — a dual role that taught him how to
 thrive in a rigid, top-down environment while thumbing his nose at authority every chance he got. He accumulated more
 than 100 hours of demerits for drinking, partying and insubordination — a record that his classmates boasted made him a
 "century man." One classmate, who asked not to be named, recalls finding McChrystal passed out in the shower after
 downing a case of beer he had hidden under the sink. The troublemaking almost got him kicked out, and he spent hours
 subjected to forced marches in the Area, a paved courtyard where unruly cadets were disciplined. "I'd come visit, and I'd

end up spending most of my time in the library, while Stan was in the Area," recalls Annie, who began dating McChrystal
in 1973.
McChrystal wound up ranking 298 out of a class of 855, a serious underachievement for a man widely regarded as
brilliant. His most compelling work was extracurricular: As managing editor of The Pointer, the West Point literary
magazine, McChrystal wrote seven short stories that eerily foreshadow many of the issues he would confront in his
career. In one tale, a fictional officer complains about the difficulty of training foreign troops to fight; in another, a 19-year-
old soldier kills a boy he mistakes for a terrorist. In "Brinkman's Note," a piece of suspense fiction, the unnamed narrator
appears to be trying to stop a plot to assassinate the president. It turns out, however, that the narrator himself is the
assassin, and he's able to infiltrate the White House: "The President strode in smiling. From the right coat pocket of the
raincoat I carried, I slowly drew forth my 32-caliber pistol. In Brinkman's failure, I had succeeded."
After graduation, 2nd Lt. Stanley McChrystal entered an Army that was all but broken in the wake of Vietnam. "We really
felt we were a peacetime generation," he recalls. "There was the Gulf War, but even that didn't feel like that big of a deal."
So McChrystal spent his career where the action was: He enrolled in Special Forces school and became a regimental
commander of the 3rd Ranger Battalion in 1986. It was a dangerous position, even in peacetime — nearly two dozen
Rangers were killed in training accidents during the Eighties. It was also an unorthodox career path: Most soldiers who
want to climb the ranks to general don't go into the Rangers. Displaying a penchant for transforming systems he considers
outdated, McChrystal set out to revolutionize the training regime for the Rangers. He introduced mixed martial arts,
required every soldier to qualify with night-vision goggles on the rifle range and forced troops to build up their endurance
with weekly marches involving heavy backpacks.
In the late 1990s, McChrystal shrewdly improved his inside game, spending a year at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government and then at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he co-authored a treatise on the merits and drawbacks
of humanitarian interventionism. But as he moved up through the ranks, McChrystal relied on the skills he had learned as
a troublemaking kid at West Point: knowing precisely how far he could go in a rigid military hierarchy without getting
tossed out. Being a highly intelligent badass, he discovered, could take you far — especially in the political chaos that
followed September 11th. "He was very focused," says Annie. "Even as a young officer he seemed to know what he
wanted to do. I don't think his personality has changed in all these years."

By some accounts, McChrystal's career should have been over at least two times by now. As Pentagon spokesman
during the invasion of Iraq, the general seemed more like a White House mouthpiece than an up-and-coming commander
with a reputation for speaking his mind. When Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld made his infamous "stuff happens"
remark during the looting of Baghdad, McChrystal backed him up. A few days later, he echoed the president's Mission
Accomplished gaffe by insisting that major combat operations in Iraq were over. But it was during his next stint —
overseeing the military's most elite units, including the Rangers, Navy Seals and Delta Force — that McChrystal took part
in a cover-up that would have destroyed the career of a lesser man.
After Cpl. Pat Tillman, the former-NFL-star-turned-Ranger, was accidentally killed by his own troops in Afghanistan in April
2004, McChrystal took an active role in creating the impression that Tillman had died at the hands of Taliban fighters. He
signed off on a falsified recommendation for a Silver Star that suggested Tillman had been killed by enemy fire.
(McChrystal would later claim he didn't read the recommendation closely enough — a strange excuse for a commander
known for his laserlike attention to minute details.) A week later, McChrystal sent a memo up the chain of command,
specifically warning that President Bush should avoid mentioning the cause of Tillman's death. "If the circumstances of
Corporal Tillman's death become public," he wrote, it could cause "public embarrassment" for the president.
  "The false narrative, which McChrystal clearly helped construct, diminished Pat's true actions," wrote Tillman's mother,
Mary, in her book Boots on the Ground by Dusk. McChrystal got away with it, she added, because he was the "golden
boy" of Rumsfeld and Bush, who loved his willingness to get things done, even if it included bending the rules or skipping
the chain of command. Nine days after Tillman's death, McChrystal was promoted to major general.
Two years later, in 2006, McChrystal was tainted by a scandal involving detainee abuse and torture at Camp Nama in
Iraq. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, prisoners at the camp were subjected to a now-familiar litany of
abuse: stress positions, being dragged naked through the mud. McChrystal was not disciplined in the scandal, even
 though an interrogator at the camp reported seeing him inspect the prison multiple times. But the experience was so
 unsettling to McChrystal that he tried to prevent detainee operations from being placed under his command in
 Afghanistan, viewing them as a "political swamp," according to a U.S. official. In May 2009, as McChrystal prepared for
 his confirmation hearings, his staff prepared him for hard questions about Camp Nama and the Tillman cover-up. But the
 scandals barely made a ripple in Congress, and McChrystal was soon on his way back to Kabul to run the war in
 Afghanistan.
 The media, to a large extent, have also given McChrystal a pass on both controversies. Where Gen. Petraeus is kind of a
 dweeb, a teacher's pet with a Ranger's tab, McChrystal is a snake-eating rebel, a "Jedi" commander, as Newsweek called
 him. He didn't care when his teenage son came home with blue hair and a mohawk. He speaks his mind with a candor
 rare for a high-ranking official. He asks for opinions, and seems genuinely interested in the response. He gets briefings on
 his iPod and listens to books on tape. He carries a custom-made set of nunchucks in his convoy engraved with his name
 and four stars, and his itinerary often bears a fresh quote from Bruce Lee. ("There are no limits. There are only plateaus,
 and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them.") He went out on dozens of nighttime raids during his time in Iraq,
 unprecedented for a top commander, and turned up on missions unannounced, with almost no entourage. "The fucking

lads love Stan McChrystal," says a British officer who serves in Kabul. "You'd be out in Somewhere, Iraq, and someone
would take a knee beside you, and a corporal would be like 'Who the fuck is that?' And it's fucking Stan McChrystal."
It doesn't hurt that McChrystal was also extremely successful as head of the Joint Special Operations Command, the elite
forces that carry out the government's darkest ops. During the Iraq surge, his team killed and captured thousands of
insurgents, including Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq. "JSOC was a killing machine," says Maj. Gen.
Mayville, his chief of operations. McChrystal was also open to new ways of killing. He systematically mapped out terrorist
networks, targeting specific insurgents and hunting them down — often with the help of cyberfreaks traditionally shunned
by the military. "The Boss would find the 24-year-old kid with a nose ring, with some fucking brilliant degree from MIT,
sitting in the corner with 16 computer monitors humming," says a Special Forces commando who worked with McChrystal
in Iraq and now serves on his staff in Kabul. "He'd say, 'Hey — you fucking muscleheads couldn't find lunch without help.
You got to work together with these guys.'"
Even in his new role as America's leading evangelist for counterinsurgency, McChrystal retains the deep-seated instincts
of a terrorist hunter. To put pressure on the Taliban, he has upped the number of Special Forces units in Afghanistan from
four to 19. "You better be out there hitting four or five targets tonight," McChrystal will tell a Navy Seal he sees in the
hallway at headquarters. Then he'll add, "I'm going to have to scold you in the morning for it, though." In fact, the general
frequently finds himself apologizing for the disastrous consequences of counterinsurgency. In the first four months of this
year, NATO forces killed some 90 civilians, up 76 percent from the same period in 2009 — a record that has created
tremendous resentment among the very population that COIN theory is intent on winning over. In February, a Special
Forces night raid ended in the deaths of two pregnant Afghan women and allegations of a cover-up, and in April, protests
erupted in Kandahar after U.S. forces accidentally shot up a bus, killing five Afghans. "We've shot an amazing number of
people," McChrystal recently conceded.
Despite the tragedies and miscues, McChrystal has issued some of the strictest directives to avoid civilian casualties that
the U.S. military has ever encountered in a war zone. It's "insurgent math," as he calls it — for every innocent person you
kill, you create 10 new enemies. He has ordered convoys to curtail their reckless driving, put restrictions on the use of air
power and severely limited night raids. He regularly apologizes to Hamid Karzai when civilians are killed, and berates
commanders responsible for civilian deaths. "For a while," says one U.S. official, "the most dangerous place to be in
Afghanistan was in front of McChrystal after a 'civ cas' incident." The ISAF command has even discussed ways to make
not killing into something you can win an award for: There's talk of creating a new medal for "courageous restraint," a
 buzzword that's unlikely to gain much traction in the gung-ho culture of the U.S. military.
 But however strategic they may be, McChrystal's new marching orders have caused an intense backlash among his own
 troops. Being told to hold their fire, soldiers complain, puts them in greater danger. "Bottom line?" says a former Special
 Forces operator who has spent years in Iraq and Afghanistan. "I would love to kick McChrystal in the nuts. His rules of
 engagement put soldiers' lives in even greater danger. Every real soldier will tell you the same thing."
 In March, McChrystal traveled to Combat Outpost JFM — a small encampment on the outskirts of Kandahar — to confront
 such accusations from the troops directly. It was a typically bold move by the general. Only two days earlier, he had
 received an e-mail from Israel Arroyo, a 25-year-old staff sergeant who asked McChrystal to go on a mission with his unit.
 "I am writing because it was said you don't care about the troops and have made it harder to defend ourselves," Arroyo
 wrote.
 Within hours, McChrystal responded personally: "I'm saddened by the accusation that I don't care about soldiers, as it is
 something I suspect any soldier takes both personally and professionally — at least I do. But I know perceptions depend
 upon your perspective at the time, and I respect that every soldier's view is his own." Then he showed up at Arroyo's
 outpost and went on a foot patrol with the troops — not some bullshit photo-op stroll through a market, but a real live
 operation in a dangerous war zone.
 Six weeks later, just before McChrystal returned from Paris, the general received another e-mail from Arroyo. A 23-year-
 old corporal named Michael Ingram — one of the soldiers McChrystal had gone on patrol with — had been killed by an IED
  a day earlier. It was the third man the 25-member platoon had lost in a year, and Arroyo was writing to see if the general
  would attend Ingram's memorial service. "He started to look up to you," Arroyo wrote. McChrystal said he would try to
  make it down to pay his respects as soon as possible.
  The night before the general is scheduled to visit Sgt. Arroyo's platoon for the memorial, I arrive at Combat Outpost JFM
  to speak with the soldiers he had gone on patrol with. JFM is a small encampment, ringed by high blast walls and guard
  towers. Almost all of the soldiers here have been on repeated combat tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and have seen
  some of the worst fighting of both wars. But they are especially angered by Ingram's death. His commanders had
  repeatedly requested permission to tear down the house where Ingram was killed, noting that it was often used as a
  combat position by the Taliban. But due to McChrystal's new restrictions to avoid upsetting civilians, the request had been
  denied. "These were abandoned houses," fumes Staff Sgt. Kennith Hicks. "Nobody was coming back to live in them."
  One soldier shows me the list of new regulations the platoon was given. "Patrol only in areas that you are reasonably
  certain that you will not have to defend yourselves with lethal force," the laminated card reads. For a soldier who has
  traveled halfway around the world to fight, that's like telling a cop he should only patrol in areas where he knows he won't
  have to make arrests. "Does that make any fucking sense?" asks Pfc. Jared Pautsch. "We should just drop a fucking
  bomb on this place. You sit and ask yourself: What are we doing here?"
  The rules handed out here are not what McChrystal intended — they've been distorted as they passed through the chain of
  command — but knowing that does nothing to lessen the anger of troops on the ground. "Fuck, when I came over here and

heard that McChrystal was in charge, I thought we would get our fucking gun on," says Hicks, who has served three tours
of combat. "I get COIN. I get all that. McChrystal comes here, explains it, it makes sense. But then he goes away on his
bird, and by the time his directives get passed down to us through Big Army, they're all fucked up — either because
somebody is trying to cover their ass, or because they just don't understand it themselves. But we're fucking losing this
thing."
McChrystal and his team show up the next day. Underneath a tent, the general has a 45-minute discussion with some two
dozen soldiers. The atmosphere is tense. "I ask you what's going on in your world, and I think it's important for you all to
understand the big picture as well," McChrystal begins. "How's the company doing? You guys feeling sorry for
yourselves? Anybody? Anybody feel like you're losing?" McChrystal says.
"Sir, some of the guys here, sir, think we're losing, sir," says Hicks.
McChrystal nods. "Strength is leading when you just don't want to lead," he tells the men. "You're leading by example.
That's what we do. Particularly when it's really, really hard, and it hurts inside." Then he spends 20 minutes talking about
counterinsurgency, diagramming his concepts and principles on a whiteboard. He makes COIN seem like common sense,
but he's careful not to bullshit the men. "We are knee-deep in the decisive year," he tells them. The Taliban, he insists, no
longer has the initiative — "but I don't think we do, either." It's similar to the talk he gave in Paris, but it's not winning any
hearts and minds among the soldiers. "This is the philosophical part that works with think tanks," McChrystal tries to joke.
"But it doesn't get the same reception from infantry companies."
During the question-and-answer period, the frustration boils over. The soldiers complain about not being allowed to use
lethal force, about watching insurgents they detain be freed for lack of evidence. They want to be able to fight — like they
did in Iraq, like they had in Afghanistan before McChrystal. 'We aren't putting fear into the Taliban," one soldier says.
"Winning hearts and minds in COIN is a coldblooded thing," McChrystal says, citing an oft-repeated maxim that you can't
kill your way out of Afghanistan. "The Russians killed 1 million Afghans, and that didn't work."
"I'm not saying go out and kill everybody, sir," the soldier persists. "You say we've stopped the momentum of the
insurgency. I don't believe that's true in this area. The more we pull back, the more we restrain ourselves, the stronger it's
getting."
"I agree with you," McChrystal says. "In this area, we've not made progress, probably. You have to show strength here,
you have to use fire. What I'm telling you is, fire costs you. What do you want to do? You want to wipe the population out
here and resettle it?"
A soldier complains that under the rules, any insurgent who doesn't have a weapon is immediately assumed to be a
civilian. "That's the way this game is," McChrystal says. "It's complex. I can't just decide: It's shirts and skins, and we'll kill
all the shirts."
As the discussion ends, McChrystal seems to sense that he hasn't succeeded at easing the men's anger. He makes one
last-ditch effort to reach them, acknowledging the death of Cpl. Ingram. "There's no way I can make that easier," he tells
them. "No way I can pretend it won't hurt. No way I can tell you not to feel that. . . . I will tell you, you're doing a great job.
Don't let the frustration get to you." The session ends with no clapping, and no real resolution. McChrystal may have sold
 President Obama on counterinsurgency, but many of his own men aren't buying it.

When it comes to Afghanistan, history is not on McChrystal's side. The only foreign invader to have any success here
was Genghis Khan — and he wasn't hampered by things like human rights, economic development and press scrutiny.
The COIN doctrine, bizarrely, draws inspiration from some of the biggest Western military embarrassments in recent
memory: France's nasty war in Algeria (lost in 1962) and the American misadventure in Vietnam (lost in 1975).
McChrystal, like other advocates of COIN, readily acknowledges that counterinsurgency campaigns are inherently messy,
expensive and easy to lose. "Even Afghans are confused by Afghanistan," he says. But even if he somehow manages to
succeed, after years of bloody fighting with Afghan kids who pose no threat to the U.S. homeland, the war will do little to
shut down Al Qaeda, which has shifted its operations to Pakistan. Dispatching 150,000 troops to build new schools,
roads, mosques and water-treatment facilities around Kandahar is like trying to stop the drug war in Mexico by occupying
Arkansas and building Baptist churches in Little Rock. "It's all very cynical, politically," says Marc Sageman, a former CIA
case officer who has extensive experience in the region. "Afghanistan is not in our vital interest — there's nothing for us
there."
In mid-May, two weeks after visiting the troops in Kandahar, McChrystal travels to the White House for a high-level visit by
Hamid Karzai. It is a triumphant moment for the general, one that demonstrates he is very much in command — both in
Kabul and in Washington. In the East Room, which is packed with journalists and dignitaries, President Obama sings the
praises of Karzai. The two leaders talk about how great their relationship is, about the pain they feel over civilian
casualties. They mention the word "progress" 16 times in under an hour. But there is no mention of victory. Still, the •
session represents the most forceful commitment that Obama has made to McChrystal's strategy in months. "There is no
denying the progress that the Afghan people have made in recent years — in education, in health care and economic
development," the president says. "As I saw in the lights across Kabul when I landed — lights that would not have been
visible just a few years earlier."
It is a disconcerting observation for Obama to make. During the worst years in Iraq, when the Bush administration had no
real progress to point to, officials used to offer up the exact same evidence of success. "It was one of our first
impressions," one GOP official said in 2006, after landing in Baghdad at the height of the sectarian violence. "So many
lights shining brightly." So it is to the language of the Iraq War that the Obama administration has turned — talk of

progress, of city lights, of metrics like health care and education. Rhetoric that just a few years ago they would have
mocked. "They are trying to manipulate perceptions because there is no definition of victory — because victory is not even
defined or recognizable," says Celeste Ward, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation who served as a political
adviser to U.S. commanders in Iraq in 2006. "That's the game we're in right now. What we need, for strategic purposes, is
to create the perception that we didn't get run off. The facts on the ground are not great, and are not going to become
great in the near future."
But facts on the ground, as history has proven, offer little deterrent to a military determined to stay the course. Even those
closest to McChrystal know that the rising anti-war sentiment at home doesn't begin to reflect how deeply fucked up things
are in Afghanistan. "If Americans pulled back and started paying attention to this war, it would become even less popular,"
a senior adviser to McChrystal says. Such realism, however, doesn't prevent advocates of counterinsurgency from
dreaming big: Instead of beginning to withdraw troops next year, as Obama promised, the military hopes to ramp up its
counterinsurgency campaign even further. "There's a possibility we could ask for another surge of U.S. forces next
summer if we see success here," a senior military official in Kabul tells me.
Back in Afghanistan, less than a month after the White House meeting with Karzai and all the talk of "progress,"
McChrystal is hit by the biggest blow to his vision of counterinsurgency. Since last year, the Pentagon had been planning
to launch a major military operation this summer in Kandahar, the country's second-largest city and the Taliban's original
home base. It was supposed to be a decisive turning point in the war — the primary reason for the troop surge that
McChrystal wrested from Obama late last year. But on June 10th, acknowledging that the military still needs to lay more
groundwork, the general announced that he is postponing the offensive until the fall. Rather than one big battle, like
Fallujah or Ramadi, U.S. troops will implement what McChrystal calls a "rising tide of security." The Afghan police and
army will enter Kandahar to attempt to seize control of neighborhoods, while the U.S. pours $90 million of aid into the city
to win over the civilian population.
Even proponents of counterinsurgency are hard-pressed to explain the new plan. "This isn't a classic operation," says a
U.S. military official. "It's not going to be Black Hawk Down. There aren't going to be doors kicked in." Other U.S. officials
insist that doors are going to be kicked in, but that it's going to be a kinder, gentler offensive than the disaster in Marja.
"The Taliban have a jackboot on the city," says a military official. "We have to remove them, but we have to do it in a way
that doesn't alienate the population." When Vice President Biden was briefed on the new plan in the Oval Office, insiders
say he was shocked to see how much it mirrored the more gradual plan of counterterrorism that he advocated last fall.
"This looks like CT-plus!" he said, according to U.S. officials familiar with the meeting.
Whatever the nature of the new plan, the delay underscores the fundamental flaws of counterinsurgency. After nine years
of war, the Taliban simply remains too strongly entrenched for the U.S. military to openly attack. The very people that
COIN seeks to win over — the Afghan people — do not want us there. Our supposed ally, President Karzai, used his
influence to delay the offensive, and the massive influx of aid championed by McChrystal is likely only to make things
worse. "Throwing money at the problem exacerbates the problem," says Andrew Wilder, an expert at Tufts University who
has studied the effect of aid in southern Afghanistan. "A tsunami of cash fuels corruption, delegitimizes the government
and creates an environment where we're picking winners and losers" — a process that fuels resentment and hostility
among the civilian population. So far, counterinsurgency has succeeded only in creating a never-ending demand for the
primary product supplied by the military: perpetual war. There is a reason that President Obama studiously avoids using
the word "victory" when he talks about Afghanistan. Winning, it would seem, is not really possible. Not even with
Stanley McChrystal in charge.
