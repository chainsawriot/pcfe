                                   US Election And The Fed
                               Welcome To The New (Old) World
                                                                                                  September 19, 2010

  One of the main debates inside senior Fed offices is how much they may have to balance a much more
  conservative fiscal policy if the Republicans take over. This is the most important question facing officials
  on both sides of the fence (far more than squiggles and whirls of monthly numbers).

  But it's not just spending and taxes, important as they are, it's also implementation of Reg Reform and
  Health Care Reform. All of that is going to change after November. Here are the details.

  Amid the snarkiness about how crazy the Tea Party candidates may be (and, as you know, we LOVE
  snarkiness) two things should not be lost:
1. The President has lost control of the spending and tax agenda
2. The President has lost control of implementing the Reg Reform and health care
   legislation Congress pushed through.
  All polling from both parties and independent sources point strongly to the Republicans taking over the
  House. Although they are less likely to take over the Senate, they will be able to gain effective control of
  spending, taxes and large scale administrative reforms.

  Let's start with spending:

  The basic fact is that all spending has to be approved by Congress and it starts with the House. As we
  wrote nearly a week ago, House Republican Leader Boehner and his senior staff have made it clear to us
  that they would like to freeze spending at 2008 levels with an annual cost savings of $340 billion. This will
  be one of the top Republican priorities.

   Freezing spending at 2008 levels will not happen. However, even in the unlikely event the Republicans do
   not take over the House the budget will -- at most -- be frozen at or near FY 2010 levels (i.e. the last time
   money was formally appropriated).

   Since there have been no spending bills approved and the fiscal year starts in October, the Congress has
   to pass a "continuing resolution" that keeps the government running until specific appropriations are made
   (the 1995 government shutdown happened because there were no appropriations and no continuing
   resolution...the government literally runs out of spending authority).

   Congress will pass a CR in the next few weeks and it will most likely run through the formation of the new
   Congress (say February or March) next year. They could only do it through the lame duck session, but
   that would be cutting it close and too cute.

   Because the new Congress - even if the Republicans fail to take full control of the House - will be
   dominated by fiscal conservatives, Boehner's CR idea will have traction. The Senate will make it more
   moderate, but then it will be up to the President to veto it and thus shut down government or sign it and
   take the hit.

     In turn that does two things: (1) it frees up money for the Bush tax rollovers and (2) it helps the plan to
     slow or freeze implementation of the reg reform and health care reform bills.

     The first part is obvious. The second may be less so. People forget that implementation of these rules
     requires staff increases, staff reg writing, etc and that's money. By freezing spending at previous levels
     you freeze the ability to hire new staff and you seriously obstruct the new rule writing process.

     Add to that Boehner's commitment to overturn the two major regulatory reforms and you've got a tidal
     wave of indecision and paralysis (Jesus, talk about mixed metaphors although it would be interesting to
     see one of those).

     The hearings he will announce and simply the chilling effect of him threatening to overturn the laws will
     accomplish ninety-percent of what he wants to get done, and potentially give the courts time to strike
     down parts of the health care bill now under appeal.


     THE SENATE

     While everyone has written off Republican control of the Senate (we haven't), the attention should be on
     what the Senate will look like even if the consensus of 52-54 Democratic majority prevails.

     The point is how the US Senate will function in January 2011 given its new membership. We got a
     glimpse of what this would look like when moderate Republican Scott Brown was elected and the health
     care public option was panned and Reg Reform was trimmed around the edges.

     The incoming crop of members are much more ardent on government spending, the debt, taxes and
     regulatory oversight. They will make Boehner's job much easier

     Take a quick look at the new members (and the several they will marry up with once they are sworn into
     office).

     While some of these candidates are replacing Republican open seats, all of them are generally considered
     more conservative than their predecessors:

1. ck (CO) - likely winner
2. Toomey (PA) - likely winner
3. Rubio (FL) - likely winner
4. Ayotte (NH) - likely winner
5. Blunt (MO) - likely winner
6. Portman (OH) -likely winner
7. Coats (IN) - likely winner
8. Paul (KY) - likely winner
9. Miller (AK) - likely winner
10.       Lee (UT) - likely winner
11.       Boozman (AR) - likely winner
12.       Hoeven (ND) - likely winner
13.       Kirk (IL) - 50/50 (lean GOP)
14.       Angle (NV) - 50/50 tossup
    There are several other Democrat-controlled seats that remain in play (CA, WI, WA, and CT). These races
    continue to develop and we will report more as the picture on Election Day becomes clearer.
    These likely new members will join the following traditional budget trouble-makers in the US Senate:

1.   DeMint (SC)
2.   Coburn (OK)
3.   Inhofe (OK)
4.   McConnell (KY)
5.   Kyl (AZ)
6.   McCain (AZ)
7.   Thune (SD)

8. Crapo (ID)
9. Vitter (LA)
10.        Burr (NC)
    One aggressive Senator can slow the body to a snail's pace, and Republicans operated efficiently as a
    minority party with only 41 votes total. In January, there will be at least 22 new and existing serious road
    blocks now patrolling the Senate Floor. The Republican pick-ups will make getting to 60 votes for cloture
    impossible on spending bills.

   Welcome to the new reality.
