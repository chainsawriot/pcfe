Dear Mack:

Thank you for following up on this matter. I know she appreciated your conversation and has been concerned about this
matter.

I will flag for Lona â€” this week is relatively hectic so it may be a weekend or next week call but will flag now as this issue
is ripe.

Best.

Subject: Call with Secretary Clinton

Dear Cheryl,

Good morning on a consequential and indeed historic week in the life of our country given the passage of health care
reform. President Obama was courageous, persevering and skilled in his leadership and efforts. Having said that, in my
humble opinion, he would not have been successful had it not been for President Clinton's, Hillary's and our efforts in
1994. That's my story and I'm sticking to it, and I believe it's true.

I know this has been a particularly demanding week in the life of the Secretary and in your life as well. Having
Netanyahu, AIPAC and a major trip to Mexico to fight the narco-traffickers is a formidable task even for Hillary Clinton.

Cheryl, I would like to respectfully request a brief meeting or phone call with Secretary Clinton following up on the
conversation she initiated with me at the Vital Voices event regarding the IDB. It's my sense and belief that this matter
needs to be carefully handled for a number of reasons including the longstanding friendship that both the Secretary and
President Clinton have with Luis Alberto Moreno. I also have another important and timely matter (personal not
business) that I would like to discuss with Hillary in our time together.

As I think you know, I try to be very judicious about these types of requests. I think 15 minutes either in person or by
phone will be adequate to cover both of these subjects. As always, I appreciate your consideration relating to my
request. Thank you and I'll await your guidance and direction.
