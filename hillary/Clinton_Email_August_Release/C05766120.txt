The Obama party is called for 7:00pm too. I will find out if that means cocktails first and then sitting down to dinner,
which may mean you could do a quick drop by Tamera's on the front end.

WONDERFUL (if you can and only if        ) Late 'cause of all those overly-hard working State-ites.... 7 to 9:30.

          A big, warm hello and

        As you may know, I signed up for hosting another holiday party with many Senate alum suggesting the idea as a
way of having a reunion and, hey, a party. We invited staff covering most of our years, and looks like a great collection
will come. It'll be pot-luck so not quite as elegant as before.

       SO, just in case, and I'd imagine it's not possible, it'll be Monday night, 7:00 to 9:30, December 21.

       No matter what, wanted you to know we are gathering yet again with our Senator Clinton bond.

       love, T
