Philippe and I had an offline conversation about this and I agree entirely. I think it makes sense for you to meet
with influencers on a regular -- though not intrusive -- basis. An OTR conversation with you is the best way to
help guys like Brooks "figure out" how things work.

 Not sure - but this is a good excuse to bring him in for an OTR with you. Lona mentioned you wanted to see
 Tom Friedman - with your ok, we could schedule both (separately) over the next month or so

I'd very much like to get back in the habit of bringing someone or a small group in every few weeks.

Took a shot at me in his column today. Any ideas what prompted it?
