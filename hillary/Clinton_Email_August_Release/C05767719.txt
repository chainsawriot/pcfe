Dave,
According to the Agricultural Agreement between Israel and the US from 2004 (ATAP), carp is not exempted
from custom duties. Last December the Israeli customs realized that according to the tariff list their is no
customs on the importation of carp to Israel. That was amended. A few weeks ago a representative of the
relevant company in Illinois contacted our trade mission to inquire about the new customs tariff and was told
that it would apply to all the carp his company will send to Israel. Therefore it should not have been a surprise
to the company this new customs tariff. Their are now 2 containers of the fish that are sitting in the port in Israel
waiting to be cleared and their are another 7 containers waiting in Illinois to get the green light to leave for
Israel. Our trade representative here thinks he could get an exemption for the two containers already in Israel
from the new customs tariff but probably not for the other 7. We at the embassy have asked he highest political
level in Israel to see if we could get an exemption from customs for all the 9 containers.

Hi Daniel-We're not just concerned about customs, but would like to understand what the issue is preventing delivery.
Thanks. Dave

Ohad
This is from Secretary Clinton's office. Can you understand why he thinks the customs was paid?

Hi Daniel-Sony to bother you on shabbat, but during yesterday's hearing with the Secretary, Rep Manzullo he asked her to help soert
out the issue of gifilte fish shipments from a plant in his district to Israel. She, of course, said she would. So, I'm asking for some help
in sorting through this. I have heard that the Israeli customer may have paid the duty, but this is unconfirmed. Any light you could
shed on this would be appreciated. BTW, my cell number is                         Thanks. Dave
