Dear Rubens and Antonio:

I just wanted to personally congratulate you on behalf of Brazil for being the first donor to sign on and contribute to the
Haiti Reconstruction Fund.

I am sorry I was in Haiti yesterday and could not attend the signing ceremony.

Brazil's $55 million contribution is truly impressive! To my knowledge, there is no precedent for any other emerging
donor contributing at this !evertÂ° a multilateral post-disaster or post-conflict trust fund.

I hope your example encourages other donors to follow suit.

Thank you again for all you are doing for Haiti.

Best.
