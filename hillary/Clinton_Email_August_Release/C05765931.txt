Thanks very much for contacting me-- I just got off a plane in Florida on my way to Mexico for my first visit and
consultations w Carlos Pascual. Return Wed morning.

                                                                                                                      1.4(B)

On Honduras we are ok-- despite complications. We maintain a principled position (no to coup), with a realistic one
based on need to have an end game for Honduras. Our formulation that election was necessary but not sufficient —
succeeded in shifting dynamic in many other countries and pushing back on erroneous press reports alleging
administration vacillation.

                                                                                                                           B5

Arturo--

 I spoke w                     as I know you did as well. I'd like to discuss ideas about what we can do to help and        1.4(D)
summon more support in their reaction to Chavez.                                                                            B1
Pls think thru possible public and private strategies that we can discuss Monday.




 And, finally, what's the latest from Honduras?
                                                                                                                       B5
 It's never dull in WHA! Thanks, Hillary
