Subject: (Reuters) Iranian woman to be hanged Wednesday -rights group

BERLIN (Reuters) - An Iranian woman whose sentence of execution by stoning for adultery provoked a worldwide outcry
will instead be hanged for murder on November 3, a human rights group said.

  "The authorities in Tehran have given the go-ahead to Tabriz prison for the execution of Iran stoning case Sakineh
Mohammadi Ashtiani," the International Committee against Stoning, a German-based campaign group, said on its
website.

  "It has been reported that she is to be executed this Wednesday, 3 November."

  Officials in Iran were not available to confirm or deny the report.
