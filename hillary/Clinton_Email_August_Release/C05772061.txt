Subject: (AP) WildLeaks: Israel's Netanyahu supports land swaps

JERUSALEM (AP) - A confidential diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks shows Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu supporting the notion of land swaps with the Palestinians. The Feb. 26, 2009 cable, dated two weeks after
Netanyahu was elected, is the first indication of the Israeli leader's position on that concept. The cable says, "Netanyahu
expressed support for the concept of land swaps, and emphasized that he did not want to govern the West Bank and
Gaza but rather to stop attacks from being launched from there."
