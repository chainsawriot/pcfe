Hi Rich,
This is not quite the case.. ..the russians certainly do want it lifted.


Levin wants two votes: one to lift it with provisions that the russians would be committed to meet and then another vote to
determine if they have been met.


I will send her a more detailed memo when I get back.
Thanks,
Bob

Hi Bob—

The Secretary had a conversation with Senator Levin today about Jackson/Vanik — Levin told her that the
Administration has been opposed to his efforts to lift the Jackson Vanik restrictions pertaining to Russia. He
said that Administration officials have been telling him that the Russians don't want them lifted. This didn't
make a whole lot of sense to me, but she asked me to follow-up with you to find out our current posture on
Jackson Vanik and Russia. She'd like to get back to Senator Levin soon. I leave it up to you how you want to
get the info to her, but I did want to pass along her request.

Thanks, and hope all else is well.

Rich
