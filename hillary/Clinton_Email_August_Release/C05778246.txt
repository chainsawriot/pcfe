PORT-AU-PRINCE (AP) - Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has arrived in Haiti. Palin arrived with the Rev. Franklin Graham
as part of a humanitarian mission by his Samaritan's Purse relief organization. Group spokeswoman Roseann Denny says
details about Palin's itinerary are not being released for security reasons. The potential U.S. presidential candidate is
expected to visit the Haitian capital and stop by cholera-treatment centers and other projects of Graham's charity group.
