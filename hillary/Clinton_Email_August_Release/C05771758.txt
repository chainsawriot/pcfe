On Wednesday, the IEC certifies the final results for 34 out of 35 constituencies in the Parliamentary Elections. The Chairperson of
the IEC noted that while results for Ghazni elections were not included in the final results due to "technical issues," they would be
announced in the upcoming three to five days. The UN and US embassy issued statements welcoming the results and commending the
work of the IEC and ECC. While the Palace has not made any public comments, the Attorney General's office—which has served as
the Government's mouthpiece to challenge the election institutions—continues to question the election outcome, criticizing the UN
for endorsing the results and vowing that it will continue to investigate allegations of corruption and fraud in the IEC and ECC. In a
last minute effort to influence the election announcement, the Attorney General had called for the suspension of the IEC and ECC
spokesmen. The embassy has reported that the IEC and ECC have dismissed the Attorney General's comments as political posturing
intended to influence the outcome in Ghazni.

Demonstrations have been taking place in various parts of the country are likely to grow, given the Attorney General's comments. The
political leadership appears to be split along ethnic lines, with a number of prominent Hazara and Tajik leaders—including Amrullah
Saleh and Abdullah Abdullah—insisting that the election results in all 34 provinces being upheld, while Pashtun leaders—including
Ashraf Ghani—questioning the legitimacy of the election results in a number of provinces. The President has noted that he will confer
with his two Vice Presidents and jihadi leaders before commenting on the results. Vice President Khalili has been the key Hazara
leader working with the UN to broker a deal to resolve the Ghazni elections.
