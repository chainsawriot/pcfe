Subject: women and reconciliation

In light of our discussion re. women and reconciliation, I wanted to alert you to a recent incident that has
generated a great deal of concern among Afghan women. Two days ago, a local Taliban commander executed a
pregnant widow for having an "illicit affair" (the man was not punished). While there are varying accounts of
the incident, the authorities have confirmed that she was shot in the head several times after being flogged up to
200 times in Qadis district (which is completely under the control of the Taliban) of Badghis.Government
authorities have condemned the incident, noting that due process was not carried out.

In meetings today, Afghan women leaders, including some who in the past accepted reconciliation as inevitable,
expressed both fear and bitterness over the incident and shared concerns that such brutality against
women would be far more prevalent if reconciliation occurred. They noted frustration about the lack of
transparency in the government's reintegration and reconciliation processes. A number of women questioned
what the government is willing to bargain in order to achieve a peace settlement and the extent to which it is
prepared to roll women's rights back to appease the Taliban. They noted that women's rights are treated as a
nuisance by the government leadership rather than as an important element of the peace process.

Melanne also met with President Karzai and was dismayed when he told her that there weren't any women's
names on the list of potential candidates for the High Peace Council. Stanekzai is said to have come up with a
list of 300 names (FRIC reports that women were on the list) that has been wittled down to about 30 names.
While the list is far from being finalized, President Karzai does not currently appear to be prioritizing women's
inclusion in the body--despite the fact that the APRP commits to it. Afghan women have called for 20% to 30%
inclusion of women in the High Peace Council and the Joint Secretariat. We will be meeting with Stanekzai
trmw and raise this issue.

Best,
