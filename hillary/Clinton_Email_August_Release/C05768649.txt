Ambassador Holbrooke is scheduled to attend the Brussels Forum, March 26 - 27. The Forum is
similar to the Munich Security Conference: a collection of high-profile leaders, journalists
and policy-makers from the U.S., Europe and Asia. The Forum is sponsored by the German
Marshall Fund (Ron Asmus), and Ambassador Holbrooke has attended every year. His presence
this year consists of two things: 1) bilat meetings including those with EU High Rep
Catherine Ashton, Codel Casey, Nato Sec Gen Rasmussen, Ambassador Daalder, and Ambassador
Kennard (some with Mullen); and 2) an internationally televised BBC discussion on Afghanistan
and Pakistan with Admiral Mullen. The panel will be shown live and broadcast on BBC World
four times over the course of the weekend - a great communications opportunity. Fawzia Koofi,
who is the Deputy Speaker of the Afghan parliament and Former Dutch Development Minister Bert
Koenders are also on the panel. Nik Gowing from the BBC will moderate. The panel and
Holbrooke/Mullen's attendance at the forum have been announced to the media.
