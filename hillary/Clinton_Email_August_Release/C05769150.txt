Hi Jake,

You'll see that the Secretary's points for Ashton mention the idea of our sending an inter-agency expert team
to Brussels for the next few months to improve US-EU coordination on Iran sanctions prep. EU officials had
been receptive, but now the bureaucrats are saying this would be "counter-productive", and instead prefer
more regular videoconferences. Which is probably OK. Anyway, I just wanted you to know the background, in
case it comes up in the Ashton meeting.

Steve
