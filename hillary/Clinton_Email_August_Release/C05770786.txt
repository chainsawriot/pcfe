  Huma/Lauren

  I am headed back from China and I do not have S email but I wanted to pass on this info regarding Father Charlie
  Beirne, a friend to both of us and frmr Prez of LeMoyne College who is now at a hospice at Fordham University in the
  Bronx. He greatly admires S and they always had a special relationship. We had planned for him to come down and
  have lunch w us (incldg Mark Landler of the NYT who I have informed).

  Charlie called me last night and he is stoic and brave but I think he would appreciate a call from S - who is simply
  admires

• This is a Jesuit that showed his bravery by calling the Secy General of the Jesuits to ask to replace his Jesuit friend who
  had been massacred (along w others) by the military at a University in Central America.

Subject: Update on Fr. Beirne, 5.J.

Dear Trustees and Trustee Associates,

I am writing to share an update on Fr. Beirne's health. Fr. Beirne called this morning to let me know that his
cancer has reached a stage where he has made the decision not to have any further clinical intervention. He
prefers to live out the time he has remaining, six months by the doctors' projections, without the sapping of
his energy and other side effects posed by his recent treatments. I have his permission to share this sad
news with you. You may write to Fr. Beirne at Murray-Weigel Hall where he is now living (see address
below) or phone him on his cell phone at

Murray-Weigel Hall
515 E. Ford ham Road
Bronx, NY 10458-5029


I am sure that you join me in offering prayers for Fr. Beirne as he faces the challenges his illness presents in
his final months with us.

Sincerely,

Fred P. Pestello, Ph.D.
