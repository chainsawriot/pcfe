Subject: (AP) WikiLeaks to defy U.S. demands on leaked cables

WASHINGTON (AP) - The online website WikiLeaks says it will go ahead with the release of hundreds of thousands of
classified State Department documents in defiance of U.S. demands not to publish the files. The WikiLeaks website
appeared to be inaccessible, and WikiLeaks said in its Twitter feed that it was experiencing a denial of service
attack. Nevertheless, WikiLeaks said that publications in the U.S. and Europe would print the leaked diplomatic cables
even if it could not. The group's founder, Julian Assange, also tells the U.S. ambassador to Britain that WikiLeaks won't
bow to Washington's demands. The Obama administration has been bracing for the release for the past week. Top
officials have notified allies that the contents of the diplomatic cables could prove embarrassing because they contain
candid assessments of foreign leaders.
