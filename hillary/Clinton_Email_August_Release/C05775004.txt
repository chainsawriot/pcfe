 Here is a weekend factoid for you: among all living politicians in the United States who have ever held elected office,
 Hillary Clinton the most popular.

That's right. Ever since she became Secretary of State, her favorables have soared into the mid-60's
<http://www.pollingreport.com/C2.htm#Hillary>, putting her well clear of any other statewide officeholder in the
country. The only national figures who are viewed as favorably as Clinton are Michelle Obama
<http://www.pollingreport.com/o.htm#Michelle>, Colin Powell <http://www.pollingreport.com/p.htm#Powell>, and
David Patraeus <http://www.pollingreport.com/p.htm#Petraeus>. However, they have never run for office, which
invariably lowers your favorables.

Hillary Clinton will turn 69 in in the final week of the 2016 campaign, which makes her slightly younger than Ronald
Reagan when he first was elected in 1980. Also, as Secretary of State, a major presidential candidate, a U.S. Senator,
and First Lady, she is also probably more credentialed than any other potential Presidential candidate, too. There is
even talk she may become the next Secretary of Defense <http://www.politico.com/news/stories/O51O/37672.html>,
further adding to her credentials.

Some have said that, in choosing Joe Biden as Vice-President, Barack Obama did not pick a successor to lead the
Democratic Party. However, that needs rethinking. Because Barack Obama made her Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton
remains remarkably well-positioned to run for President in 2016, even more so than she was in 2008.

Anyway, have a good holiday weekend.
