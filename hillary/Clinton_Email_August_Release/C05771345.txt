MUSCAT (AP) - An American woman released from Iran after more than 13 months in custody began her journey back to
the United States after asking her supporters to "extend your prayers" to her fiancé and another American man who
remain in Tehran accused of spying. In a brief statement, Sarah Shourd thanked Oman for mediating the $500,000 bail
that led to her freedom earlier this week. But she made no mention of her ordeal inside Tehran's notorious Evin Prison
or any health problems- which her mother has said include a breast lump and precancerous cervical cells. "Please,
please extend your prayers" to the other two Americans still held- her fiancé Shane Bauer and their friend Josh Fattal-
she said at Oman's international airport before boarding an Oman Air flight on the first leg of her trip home
accompanied by her mother Nora and an uncle. She was next scheduled to appear at a news conference in New York on
September 19 timed to coincide with the arrival of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to attend the UN General
Assembly. Shourd, 32, appeared in good spirits and less gaunt than when she stepped off a private Omani jet after her
release from Iran. She thanked Omani officials for playing an intermediary role between Iran and the United States for
her release. "I'll always associate your country with the first breath of my freedom, the sweet smell of sandalwood and
a chance to stand by the ocean listening to the waves," she said, wearing long-sleeve black T-shirt covered by a white
top and white sneakers.
