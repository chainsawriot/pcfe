Dear Hillary and Anne-Marie,

For several months I've been advising on a project to take the rainforest restoration work of Dr. Willie Smits, an
Indonesian agroforester, to scale on Borneo. That Smits Model effort now has an economically sustainable
design with multiple benefits for the local forest population, the nation of Indonesia, and the planet. The
business plan has been developed by an experienced and highly reputable investment group that serves in an
Advisory role to the Prince of Wales's Trust, and the business plan has already engaged the interest of the P8, a
group of the eight largest global pension funds.

The core goals of the Arenga Reforestation Project include greenhouse gas reduction, habitat restoration,
rainforest remediation, deforestation protection, biofuel production that is non-food and carbon-positive, and
poverty alleviation for some of the most vulnerable populations on the planet. The Internal Rate of Return, on a
fairly mature business model and seven years of module testing, calculates to about 34% -- a decent investment
return for almost any industry.

You can watch Willie Smits describe the possibilities at TED (to a standing ovation) here:
http://www.ted.comitalks/willie smits_restores_a_rainforest.html

The State Department has been on the periphery of the concept development through Moira O'Neill, a Haas
Professor of Business on loan to USAlD from Cal. She has kept the conversation going with the White House,
USAID, and State, but is extremely busy with a range of other obligations and may not have the cycles to
follow this to a conclusion.

In my view this effort, the Arenga Reforestation Project, is the leading contender for an economically
sustainable tropical reforestation program, and has an unprecedented climate mitigation potential (Indonesia is
the world's #4 greenhouse-gas emitter, due largely to the burning and composting of the southern Kalimantan
peat swamps and to rapid destruction of rainforest, both of which the Smits Model can reverse). In Aug 08 I
spent 11 days visiting key sites of this project in Borneo, largely with Dr. Smits, whom I've known for about 20
years. In my opinion, and that of many others, this is the world's most sophisticated and powerful model for
integrated ecological and economic restoration, with exciting prospects for much of the tropics. I can also vouch
for the quality and integrity of the key people involved.

To make the impact even more noteworthy, the Minister of Forestry in Indonesia has now agreed to a 1:1
acreage match between Smits Model reforestation and the protection of virgin rainforest in perpetuity as
national park. For every 30,000 hectares of Smits Model reforestation, the Ministry will designate 30,000
hectares (about 116 square miles) of virgin rainforest a National Park, and they have agreed to external
monitoring by international NGOs for compliance. Since this Smits Model can scale to a million hectares, or ten
million, with continually increasing economic, social, and environmental benefits, the two-fer impact is perhaps
unprecedented.

It would be worthwhile for you to have someone from your staff take a look at this. In my carefully considered
view, the political, social, and REDD benefits could be very substantial, and the possibility of a Public-Private
Partnership is worth consideration.

The primary source for information on the project in the US is my friend and Senior Fellow at WI, the
remarkable Eric Rasmussen, MD, MDM, FACP CEO of the Google-founded humanitarian NGO called
InSTEDD. He's leading, pro bono, the team developing the business plan, and can be reached at
                           or on cell at               Pacific Time Zone.

With warmest regards -- ABL
