Subject: (AP) Diplomats: Iran expands enrichment facility

 VIENNA - (AP) Iran has set up new equipment that will allow it to boost its efficiency at enriching uranium at higher
levels, diplomats said May 14. The move is likely to give the U.S. more leverage with Russia and China in its push for new
UN sanctions on Tehran. Iran's clandestine enrichment activities were discovered eight years ago and have expanded
since to encompass thousands of centrifuges churning out material enriched to 3.5 percent. But despite three sets of
Security Council sanctions meant to enforce demands of a freeze, Tehran moved to a new level in February, when it set
up a small program to produce material enriched to near 20 percent.
