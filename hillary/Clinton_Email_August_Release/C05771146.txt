Indian PM shows solidarity with Pakistan against floods

ISLAMABAD, Aug. 19 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called his Pakistani
counterpart Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani over phone Thursday to convey the condolences and
commensurations of his government and the people of India on the loss of precious lives
and damage to the properties and infrastructure caused by floods in Pakistan.

The Indian prime minister said that the member States in the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation should come together to help Pakistan in every way possible at this
critical juncture, according to the Pakistani PM office.

Gilani thanked his Indian counterpart for his kind gesture of calling him to express his
sympathies and solidarity with Pakistan in its hour of trial.

He briefed the Indian prime minister over the huge damage caused by this unprecedented
natural calamity in all the provinces of the country, which, according to UN estimates,
was far bigger than the effects of earthquakes and tsunami which hit Pakistan in 2005 and
Haiti last year respectively.

Gilani also availed the opportunity to reiterate Pakistan's keen desire to have friendly,
cooperative and good neighborly relations with India.

He hoped that in accordance with the agreement reached in Thimphu in Bhutan in April, the
bilateral dialogue between the two countries would progress a meaningful, substantive and
result- oriented way by addressing all the issues of concern to both countries including
Kashmir dispute.
