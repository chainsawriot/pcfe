Happy New Year. I hope you got some time to enjoy the holiday season and could relax before getting back at it this
year.
Andy Young is a very good friend of mine, and has been a stalwart for the Clintons over the years. He is also one of the
most recognized and respected experts on Africa in America. He asked me today if I thought it would be appropriate for
him to seek to see the Secretary to share some of his thoughts on Africa and current issues being confronted there. I
told him of course and suggested that he reach out to you to try to arrange that dialogue. Hopefully that is ok from your
perspective. Andy is a thoughtful, remarkable and decent man. If you don't know him you will enjoy getting to know
him. Thanks and maybe one of these days when I am in DC we can grab a coffee together. Cheers.
