WASHINGTON - Former Vice President Cheney was admitted to the hospital after experiencing discomfort, the latest
health scare for the 69-year-old Republican leader who has a long history of heart disease. Cheney was expected to
remain at George Washington University Hospital over the weekend, said spokesman Peter Long. It was not
immediately clear whether Cheney's health concern was related to his previous heart troubles. He sustained his last
heart attack, deemed a mild one, in February. Cheney was not feeling well and went to see his doctors at George
Washington University. On their advice, he was admitted to the hospital for further testing.
