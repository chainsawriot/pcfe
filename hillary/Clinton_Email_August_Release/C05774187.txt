I'd like to do and probably better on Tuesday. I'll confirm tomorrow. Where do you want to go? I prefer quiet and
private around 6:30-7 if that's ok for you both.

H: Just talked to Shaun. He wants to know if, given your schedule, and in addition to your meeting with him, you can
have dinner with the two of us either Tuesday or Wednesday. Sid
