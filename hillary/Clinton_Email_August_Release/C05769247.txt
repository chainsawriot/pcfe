Subject: (AP) Pakistan detains man over Times Square bomb

KARACHI (AP) - Pakistan intelligence officials say at least one man has been detained in the southern city of Karachi in
connection with the Times Square bombing attempt. The official said the man was named Tauseef and was a friend of
Faisal Shahzad, the American of Pakistani descent who is in custody in the United States over the failed attack. He did
not say when the man was picked up. Another official said several people had been taken into custody since the failed
attack Saturday. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of their work.
