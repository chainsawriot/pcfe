Landler has called me twice -- I haven't called back because I don't want to go down the road.

I talked to Matt and off-handedly asked about the issue -- he said that people are deeply unhappy with our friend, but
not much else. Said he didn't think anything was imminent. But it was not a very optimistic conversation.
