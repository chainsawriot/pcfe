Frank — the Secretary's call was extraordinarily well-received. Good morale boost as we enter the holiday seasons
which, as you know, can be a difficult time for those serving in tough assignments far from home. Please pass on our
collective gratitude to her for spending the time with the Mission.

Also — would like to recommend




Happy holidays to all,

Karl
