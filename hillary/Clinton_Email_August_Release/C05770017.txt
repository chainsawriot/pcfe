Dear Madam Secretary,
My deepest appreciation for the very thoughtful, and very personal, letter that you
sent to me on the occasion of my being honored by the Urban Technology Center last night.
It means a great deal to me, for you to take the time from your incredibly crowded, and
important, schedule to remember me.
With warmest wishes and continuing admiration,
Carl Spielvogel
23 June 2010
