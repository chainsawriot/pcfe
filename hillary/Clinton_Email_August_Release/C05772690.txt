KABUL (Reuters) - The commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, General David Petraeus, has ordered a probe
into the death of a British aid worker killed during a rescue bid by U.S. forces, the U.S. military said. "Initial reports
indicated the explosion was caused by a detonation triggered by one of the captors who was in close proximity to Linda
Norgrove. Subsequent review of surveillance footage and discussions with members of the rescue team do not
conclusively determine the cause of her death," it said. The statement comes shortly after British Prime Minister David
Cameron told a news conference Norgrove may have been killed by a grenade from foreign forces during the rescue
operation.
