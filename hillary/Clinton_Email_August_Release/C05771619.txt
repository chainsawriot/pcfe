Background

Quote from a readout of Netanyahu's meeting with senior advisers on Friday:

"Everyone knows that restrained and moderate construction in Judea and Samaria in the next year will no even affect
the peace process. Therefore the international community needs to call on the Palestinians to continue engaging in
peace talks. It is in the interest of the Palestinians just as it is in ours"... "We did it [the moratorium] in order to give the
opportunity to enter direct negotiations without preconditions. Now I expect that the Palestinians show their flexibility
and continue with peace talks."..."Unfortunately, as opposed to us, the Palestinians are just hardening their stance."

Quote from Yasser Abed Rabbo that Bibi may raise:
 "The leadership confirms that the resumption of talks requires tangible steps, the first of them a freeze on
settlements. The Palestinian leadership holds Israel responsible for obstructing the negotiations."
