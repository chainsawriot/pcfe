Subject: (AP) Mideast peacemakers cancel conference amid rancor

UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The Quartet of Mideast peacemakers shepherding newly started direct Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations abruptly canceled a planned a news conference at the United Nations, after failing to reach agreement on
who would appear on behalf of the group.
   Senior diplomats from the Quartet (United States, the European Union, the United Nations and Russia) met on the
sidelines of the United Nations anti-poverty meeting to discuss a way forward in the negotiations, which have made
little visible progress since they resumed earlier this month and are at risk of collapsing.
