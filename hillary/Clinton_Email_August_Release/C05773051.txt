Hi -- you guys are doing great work.

Wanted to let you know that we've sent a dozen members -- nurses, paramedics and trauma specialists to Haiti. They
are working with Paul Farmer's Partners in Health. This is the first deployment of 74 members who have volunteered in
Vermont. The work and being helpful is so important to them and to us. A number of people on our staff worked
throughout the weekend to make all the necessary arrangements, but the impetus came directly from our members.

As you know the challenges are enormous, but we have a long-term commitment to the reconstruction of the health
and education sectors in Haiti. Please let us know how we can be helpful.

Hope you're well.
