You're right, it was AP that got it wrong which is why you saw it repeated in several stories. Having it corrected.

Speaking of AP, today is       s birthday, would be a nice touch to SlyDial him a birthday greeting. I'll give the # to
Huma and Lauren (he's not coming on trip so you won't see him)

Not that it matters, but several of the articles quote me as saying that the Koran burning is "distrustful". I'm not sure
that's a word, and I thought I said "distressful". Can we fix?
