Subject: Embassy Statement


As Haiti enters the period of electoral contestation, it is essential that all political actors remain
calm and encourage their supporters to do the same. The United States, together with Haiti's
international community partners, stands ready to support efforts to thoroughly review irregularities
in support of electoral results that are consistent with the will of the Haitian people expressed in
their votes.

Like others, the Government of the United States is concerned by the Provisional Electoral
Council's announcement of results from the November 28 national elections that are inconsistent
with the published results of the National Election Observation Council (CNO), which had more
than 5,500 observers and observed the vote count in 1,600 voting centers nationwide, election-day
observations by official U.S. observers accredited by the CEP, and vote counts observed around the
country by numerous domestic and international observers.


Haiti's transition to democracy over the past 24 years has seen many successes, overcoming major
challenges. The 2010 elections represent a critical test of whether the Haitian people will
determine their destiny through their vote. The United States is committed to the consolidation of
democracy in Haiti and calls on the Government of Haiti, the CEP and all political forces to ensure
that the will of the people is fully reflected in the outcome of this election.
