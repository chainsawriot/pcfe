Cheryl -

Could I ask you to pass this message to the Secretary?

I was just with Patricia Espinosa.                                               She said she had sent a personal note.   B6
She asked that I pass on her concerns as well.

She also asked me to remind the Secretary of their conversation in Montreal and that she would love to host the
Secretary for a private visit if she could spare any time before their March 23 High Level Group meeting.

Cheryl - The Mexicans have a cabinet meeting on Frida                                                                 1.4(D)
We'll let you know.                                                                                                   B1


Thank you.

Carlos
