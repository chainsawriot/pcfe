Subject:                           Speech this morning


I will be at a USGLC breakfast doing qddr so won't be at morning meeting. You will see speech, which is very hard to
write given magnitude of report coupled w/ own hall setting. We have aimed it really at press, to try to focus them as
precisely as possible in what we want their stories to be, so it's important to get those key message out. But I would just
urge you also to speak from the heart -- you know what this is reallly about better than anyone and if your passion for
making this happen and commitment to getting it done come through, it will frame the entire exercise. This is your only
chance to speak to the press about 14 months of work until we relaunch in January. There is too much going on to make
headlines, but we want there to be positive press saying you are ahead of the curve (and the new Congress) in making
govt work better. AM
