Subject: (AP) Cholera fears spark anti-clinic protest in Haiti

PORT-AU-PRINCE (AP) - Protesters attacked a cholera treatment center as it was preparing to open in the city of St.
Marc, highlighting the fear surrounding a disease that was almost unknown in Haiti before it began spreading through
the countryside, aid workers said. Some of the roughly 300 students and other protesters said they feared the Doctors
Without Borders-Spain clinic would bring more of the disease to their seaside town, which is one of the hardest hit in
the week-old epidemic that has killed 284 people and infected 3,769, according to United Nations figures. Witnesses
said the protesters threw rocks and at least one Molotov cocktail. UN peacekeepers from Argentina arrived with riot
shields to reinforce police. Warning shots were heard; the UN said its soldiers fired blanks. There were no reports of
injuries. Haitian health officials assured the crowd the clinic would not open in that neighborhood. The 400-bed facility
was intended to rehydrate and treat people with the severe diarrheal disease. Doctors Without Borders-Spain country
chief Francisco Otero said the group consulted with local authorities and told them the clinic is important for stemming
the spread of cholera. He said they would try to reopen it in another part of St. Marc.
