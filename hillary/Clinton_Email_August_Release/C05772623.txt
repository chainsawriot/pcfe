Line block questions:

Whv is the Julia Roberts interview during the time I have weekly depoartmental meeting?

Also, I don't see a mtg w POTUS on the 15th--can we get that scheduled?

T   want to have my own pre-brief before the Kissinger event.

And. I notice that the HBO event conflicts w a PC mtg at NH. Now w/Doniion in charge can
we get a set time for all the regular mtgs so we don't schedule conflicting events?

When is Adm Mullen having his small Pakistan dinner? if it's the 21st, can I get back in
time from Paris?

If La Raze can pay for a reception for Raul, why is his swearing in ceremony in the
Treaty Room instead of the Franklin? Can't we find a time for them? Also, I won't be able
to go to his reception at a hotel since I have to go to the screening for the Nat Geo
special so that day doesn't work so well. What about on the 26th after T get back from NY
since gill will be in Haiti and could come back to DC?
