Hi Lona, I just saw the S video for Mother's Day: After nearly 10 years of working for the Department, this ranks as one
of my proudest, most fulfilling moments of serving as a Foreign Service Officer.




 Clearly I'm not the only one who has made these sacrifices or who has these frustrations; Secretary Clinton has heard
 our struggles (indeed has gone through her own struggles as a professional mom!), and she truly gets it.




 I just wanted to tell somebody, and I remembered your name from the women's conference in December. Forgive this
 long message. Happy Mother's Day, and congratulations on working with such an incredible person.
