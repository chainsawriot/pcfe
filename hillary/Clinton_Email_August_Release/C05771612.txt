Lauren/Cheryl,
And--Please let Hillary know that I have invited Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd to speak at Occidental
in the coming year--on China or whatever topic he pleases. His chief of staff Philip Green has responded with
some interest, and the Australian CG in LA is very excited to make it happen. Consulate here has invited me to
speak at conference in January in LA on the US and Australia in Asia, and I have accepted (a good topic too if
embassy Canberra wanted to invite me down as PD speaker). It would be helpful, if Hillary can work it in to her
informal time with Rudd to mention me and Oxy in a favorable way and encourage him to accept the invitation
to speak on our campus. I'd certainly appreciate it.
Thanks as ever,
Derek
I just saw the news reports on the program that Hillary will be doing with young Australians in Melbourne o
Sunday. Looks great. And perhaps she will get to meet my friend Glyn Davis, head of University of Melbourne
on margins of event.
