  Colleagues:

  Further to our earlier alert, the press is widely reporting Somali gunmen disguised in army uniforms stormed a hotel
  popular with government officials on Tuesday, and a legislator said at least 15 parliamentarians were killed. There was
  no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.

  The African Union confirmed at least 15 people were killed in the attack on the Huna Hotel, in a government-controlled
  neighborhood between the presidential palace and the Indian Ocean. It did not say whether the dead were all MPs.

  Embassy Nairobi spoke with President Sheikh Sharif who confirmed that seven MPs are now dead and numerous others
â€¢ are wounded. The number of attackers is not clear, but they were dressed in Transitional Federal Government military
  uniforms. At least two blew themselves up.
