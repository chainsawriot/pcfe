Dear Cheryl —

It's our understanding that the review of the terrorist list undertaken at the beginning of the year is reaching
completion, imminently. Jim asked me to shoot you a note that this continues to be a very important issue for him and
Bill Delahunt. The list needs to be purged of political manipulation — and quite frankly, the current status quo with Cuba
needs to be broken, not further reinforced — for the sake of Alan Gross, those on the island needing space to voice their
views, and indeed, all of us outside who know change is coming.

It's time to do something bold and constructive — and in our very best interests —

Let us know if there's anything we can do to help —

Cindy

Dear Cheryl --




Attached please find a letter regarding the review of terrorist lists currently taking place within the Obama
Administration. The letter cites Cuba as a nation that should be purged from such lists, including the State Sponsors of
Terrorism list, as an example for the need of a thorough, robust and judicious review and updating of these lists.




Can you please ensure that the Secretary and other relevant State Department officials are made aware of this letter?




Very best regards --




Cindy
