FYI. Thanks again for signing the book ---- and I do hope you get royalties from Mongolia! Also thought you would like to
see the attached letter to President Clinton.

Judith —

This is simply a quick note to thank you for the inscribed Mongolian-language copy of Secretary Clinton's memoir which
just arrived. We look forward to delivering it to President Elbegdorj and know that he will be delighted. This was a
terrific idea on your part — and the fact that it now has actually happened is really gratifying as well.

FYI, let me also attach a copy of a recent letter from President Elbegdorj to former President Bill Clinton. Although
specifically highlighting the upcoming Nadaam festivities in Ulaanbaatar in mid July, I know that President Clinton would
be welcome to visit Mongolia at any time, fulfilling the desire expressed in his "Foreign Policy" interview earlier this year
that he really does want to "ride across the Mongolian steppes on horseback"!

Best regards,
Jonathan
