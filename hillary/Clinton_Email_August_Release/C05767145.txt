Hi Huma â€” I hope everything is going OK in NYC.

Attached is the latest version of Doha. As you can imagine, I'm getting edits from about 20 people, so this document will
surely change in small ways between now and tomorrow morning. There are also placeholders where people are still
getting me info, and I still working on the conclusion.

But beyond those minor additions and some changes around the margins, this is unlikely to change much (unless the
Secretary wants it to, of course). I'm available all day and night for any edits from her or you. Please feel free to call.

Thanks Huma,
Megan
