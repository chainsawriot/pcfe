Re: New developments on NI



Shaun regrets he cannot come here tomorrow. Here's the problem and the plan:

Cameron is still quietly giving encouragement to the Ulster Unionists, which,

led by Reg Empey, are trying to scuttle the agreement somehow. So the plan is

for Shaunn to announce he will deliver a speech on Monday in the House of

Commons presenting the agreement—except that at the last second Gordon will step

in on the floor for Shaun, requiring Cameron to respond, theoretically forcing

him to support the agreement. In his speech, Gordon will explicitly cite your

role and support of the US—among other things further cornering Cameron (and

Empey). Shaun would like to speak with you soon depending on how things are

working out there, perhaps tomorrow (Sunday) or perhaps Monday (perhaps after

Commons). Dinner will be on a rain-check.
