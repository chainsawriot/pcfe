Newsweek's Ben Adler: "Why is Bill Clinton So Much More Popular Than Barack Obama?" Here's a fun fact from the
latest NBC/Wall Street Journal
poll: Bill Clinton is the most popular political figure in the country.
The former president, who never won an outright majority of the popular vote and was impeached by Congress, enjoys
a 55-23 favorable/unfavorable rating. Clinton left office with an approval rating of 68 percent according to the CBS poll
at the time, so his continuing popularity is not surprising. LINK
