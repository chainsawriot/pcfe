Subject: (AP) Palestinian PM lays new claim to east Jerusalem

DAHIAT AL-BARID (AP) - The Palestinian prime minister has staked a new claim in Israel-controlled east Jerusalem,
announcing that his government has helped fund the renovation of 14 schools there.
  Israel said it will not give up any part of Jerusalem, including the eastern sector, which it captured in 1967. The
Palestinians want to make east Jerusalem their future capital.
  The Israeli government has tried to suppress any activity by Prime Minister Fayyad's Palestinian Authority in east
Jerusalem and has warned him against entering Jerusalem on November 2 to make the announcement about the
renovations.
  Fayyad avoided confrontation and chose a West Bank school on the edge of Jerusalem. The West Bank government
has spent more than $5 million on the renovations.
