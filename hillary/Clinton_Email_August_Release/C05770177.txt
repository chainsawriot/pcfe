MS -- A wonderful note!

Subject: S video on Mother's Day

Hi Lona, I just saw the S video for Mother's Day: After nearly 10 years of working for the Department, this ranks as one
of my proudest, most fulfilling moments of serving as a Foreign Service Officer.




Clearly I'm not the only one who has made these sacrifices or who has these frustrations; Secretary Clinton has heard
our struggles (indeed has gone through her own struggles as a professional mom!), and she truly gets it.

I just wanted to tell somebody, and I remembered your name from the women's conference in December. Forgive this
long message. Happy Mother's Day, and congratulations on working with such an incredible person.

Regards,
Kristin
