Jack,

Karl, Tony, and I have been in touch by phone + email while Karl is on leave in South Africa, regarding our draft budget
message (and much else of course), which you have already seen and to which you have responded via Tony.




Karl has accepted my recommendation that he try to speak directly with you on Monday, and I hope you will be able to
take his call. I judge that you and he need a meeting of the minds before we send in any message that may not give you
exactly the ammunition you need.

Meanwhile, happy new year... see you next month.
