III confirm if he'll be there for london.
As for paris, looks like sarkozy will be there but we won't know for sure till tomorrow. So it would mean sarkozy meeting,
speech and kouchner around 6pm when he's back from davos.

Contacting with wha now. Frattini would have to cancel his trip so we would have to re-schedule for another date or just
do in context of one of these multilateral meetings. He has a big speech in italy on the 26th.

Can you ask WHA to work for times so I can fly up mid morning and return late afternoon. Could I see Frattini next day?
What seems best?
