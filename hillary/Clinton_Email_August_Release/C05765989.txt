Subject:                          NPR documents



As I mentioned, you will be receiving a binder of NPR documents tonight. I mischaracterized the structure of the
binder. The cover note is merely an extended table of contents, and behind it are six 2- or 3-pagers on the six major
questions on which they seek your guidance. The papers are technical, and some are easier to read than others, but it is
worth a quick scan tonight before they march through them tomorrow.
