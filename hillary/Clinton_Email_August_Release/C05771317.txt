Thanks for making the START calls. Will follow-up as discussed.

On election news, Murkowski has come back a bit, but is still down a good 2K votes. Many rural precincts
have yet to report, and there are some 7600 absentee ballots yet to be counted. Will likely take another week to
come to closure.

With 429 of 438 precincts reporting


Joe Miller (R) 45,909 51.09%
Lisa Murkowski (R) 43,949 48.91%
