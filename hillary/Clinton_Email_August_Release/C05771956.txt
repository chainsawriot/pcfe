Robert Pape is a top strategic thinker from U of Chicago who is best known for his empirical work showing a strong
correlation between suicide terrorism and occupation by foreign troops. In his new work he is proposing a grand strategy
of off-shore/on-shore balancing, where we keep nimble deployable military forces over the horizon and use

Subject: Asking to Meet with You

Dear Anne-Marie,



As we discussed during your salon dinner with Steve Clemons at Nora's, I am developing a practical strategy of
"off-shore/on-shore balancing" that would involve key USG agencies.



As the attached proposal explains, the new strategy is substantially different from previous historical constructs
in the literature on American grand strategy and offers important advantages to improve our position in
Afghanistan and other regions in the world in the coming years.



Going forward, I would like make sure I have State's views correct. If you and your staff could meet with me
later next week, this would greatly help.



I look forward to further discussion.

Bob
