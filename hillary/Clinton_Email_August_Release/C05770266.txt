Subject: Please tell H that I spoke to Querishi.

They called in all the Ambos and gave them a general pitch. I suggested that GoP must be more specific on needs and go

I also suggested we turn next FoDP into a pledging conference. (Brussels, oct 14-15; I will represent). Can't have another
stupid empty wordfest in midst of such a disaster. RH
