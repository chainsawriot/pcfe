HI Cheryl,

Thank you once again for the lift to Santo Domingo and for your support and friendship.




After our adventure last night, I had a delayed reaction to my good news. At the risk of sounding corny, I work
up this morning feeling glad to be alive, thankful for the privilege of working with smart, dedicated and
passionate people like you, and fortunate to live in a country with clean water, electricity, education, and
healthcare.

I hope that you, David and your kids have a happy, safe and healthy holiday season.

Warmly,

Gail
