PJ,

It is not the ending. We understand that the British have now agreed to
allow those who benefited from our letter (in which we listed those
whom we believe to be American citizens) to go to the UK. (To the best
of my knowledge, the Canadians have not provided a similar letter to
those whom they believe are Canadians.) We believe the group will be
on Delta 0036 directly to Heathrow later today.

A media update, CNN just called for a comment after the British rejected the letter. I told CNN that we
provided the team/delegation the waiver letter earlier this afternoon. I quoted from it that the waiver, which
applied to 28 individuals, was a limited authorization for departure from and re-entry in the United States. I
made clear during the briefing that even though we granted the waiver they needed to gain visas from the UK.
So, there is a sad ending to the story, but I also made clear during the briefing that the unique situation that
they found themselves in stemmed from their decision not to apply for a U.S. passport. I'll keep you updated
on the media play.
