From an INR report just released:

Western Europe: Publics Credit U.S. for Relief to Haiti

Britons, French, Germans, Italians, and Spaniards say the United States has done more than other countries to assist
Haiti following the devastating January earthquake. Though relief efforts in Haiti have not themselves directly impacted
opinion of the United States, the belief that the United States generally assists disaster-stricken countries does positively
affect U.S. image.
