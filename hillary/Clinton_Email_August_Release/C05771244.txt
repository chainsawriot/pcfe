melanne

please pass my love and best wishes to secretary clinton - know this
is like pushing a boulder uphill but also know that trying the
impossible is what got northern ireland out of the mire of the past
and she was and is part of that 'pushing all participants to be 'more
than they think they can be'

love and best wishes to her and to you and all involved

inez
