       Dear Hillary,

       Next Sunday (October 17th) Valerie and I arrive in DC for a week of screenings of Fair Game, the film of
       our fight with the Bush administration. I plan to be in DC through the following Thursday. There are
       screenings in Silver Spring on Tuesday at the American Film Institute festival and on Wednesday in
       Georgetown as a benefit for the Treatment Action Group, an HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment
       organization. You, Potus (ret) and whomever you would like to bring are invited to either or
       both. Alternatively, I would be pleased to arrange a private screening for you and your guests either at
       your home or elsewhere. Depending on the time, either Valerie or I would be delighted to attend and
       answer questions afterwards.

       If these dates do not work for you, I am also happy to ensure that a screening is arranged whenever is
       convenient.

       Valerie and I think that the film tells the story of that time and are proud of it. I would be pleased to
       share it with you.

       With warmest regards. Joe
