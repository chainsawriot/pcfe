IDB Approves $70 Billion Capital Increase, Forgives Haitian Debt

The governors of the Inter-American Development Bank early Monday approved a $70 billion capital increase for the
multilateral lender and also agreed to forgive $479 million of Haitian debt, Reuters reported. Colombian Finance Minister
Oscar Zuluaga announced the move at the close of an IDB governors meeting in Candin. Last week, Moody's Investor
Services affirmed the bank's long-standing Aaa credit rating, the IDB said.
