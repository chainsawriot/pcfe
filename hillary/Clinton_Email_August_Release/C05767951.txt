State Department Investigating LGBT Treatment In Uganda and Throughout
Africa
Posted: 03 Mar 2010 11:01 PM PST

Last January, we reported that Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) wrote to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and US Trade
Representative Ron Kirk, asking them to "communicate immediately to the Ugandan government, and President Yoweri
Museveni directly, that Uganda's beneficiary status under AGOA (African Growth and Opportunity Act) will be revoked should
the proposed legislation be enacted." The legislation he's referring to, of course, is the draconian Anti-Homosexuality Bill that
is, as far as we are able to determine, awaiting its second reading before Parliament.

The State Department has now responded to Sen. Wyden's request. In a letter dated Feb 22, 2010 and released by Sen.
Wyden's office, Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs Richard Verma responded that the department is not only
"identified this issue as a priority in our bilateral relationship" with Uganda (PDF: 112KB/2 pages):

         We have reached out at the highest levels; Secretary Clinton and Assistant Secretary for African Affairs
         Johnnie Carson have discussed our concerns directly with President Museveni. In addition, our embassy in
         Kampala has been in close and regular contact with key political, media and civil society actors on the
         ground in Uganda, registering strong opposition to the bill and warning the Ugandans of potential
         consequences if it passes. The ambassador reiterated our concerns with President Museveni as recently as
         January 25, and Under Secretary for Democracy and Global Affairs Maria Otero just visited Uganda on
         January 29. She met and offered support and encouragement to civil society groups opposed to the
         legislation and underscored our views to senior Ugandan officials. We are following this bill very closely.


In Museveni's remarks urging Parliament to 'go slow" on considering the draconian legislation, ne cited a long conversation
with Secretary Clinton in declaring that the bill was not just a domestic issue but also had foreign policy considerations.

Assistant Secretary Verma characterized Uganda's proposed bill "a serious affront to internationally accepted human rights
standards." And interestingly, the State Department's concerns aren't limited to Uganda:

          The State Department is also evaluating attitudes and laws that marginalize and criminalize and penalize the
          LGBT community in Africa more broadly. We have asked all of our embassies in Africa to report on host
          country laws and pending legislation that criminalizes homosexuality. In addition, our Bureau of
          Democracy, Human Rights and Labor has established a task force on LGBT issues to strategize a United
          States Government response to LBGT issues worldwide.
