BAGHDAD â€” Prime Minister Nuni Kamal al-Maliki, seeking to show that he is in control of a tenuous new
ruling coalition, said Saturday that he would push ahead to form a new government with or without potential
allies, and that there was no need for American troops to remain in Iraq past a December 2011 deadline for
withdrawal.

In his first news conference since being formally nominated as prime minister two days ago, Mr. Maliki
acknowledged the growing frustration of Iraqis, who have watched their leaders collect salaries of up to $11,000
a month and fly off to their second homes while in much of the country's electricity remains sporadic and
violent attacks continue.

Mr. Maliki's remarks also reflected the splinters that remained inside Iraq's nascent partnership government,
and the competing interests of political groups that have coalesced behind him.
There is no need for American troops to remain in Iraq beyond December 2011, Mr. Maliki said, apparently in a
nod to the followers of the anti-American Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, who have promised to fight any
attempt to maintain an American military presence here.

The Sadrists have played a critical role in supporting Mr. Maliki for a second term after indecisive elections in
March. Some American and Iraqi officials have argued that a residual force is necessary to continue training
Iraqi soldiers and help maintain military equipment, but on Saturday, Mr. Maliki said the Iraqis could stand
alone.

"I don't see a need for any other international forces to help Iraqis control the security situation," he said.

Iraqi officials announced Saturday that they had arrested 12 people who orchestrated a bloody siege against a
Christian church here last month. They called the arrests evidence of improvements in the country's security
forces.

Interior Ministry officials said the insurgents had ties to Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, and had also planned to also
blow up the main gates of the International Zone, where the United States Embassy is located. Officials said
they had seized 6 suicide belts, 10 improvised explosive devices and 5 tons of bomb-making material as a result
of the arrests.

At his news conference, Mr. Maliki, a religious Shiite, said he wanted the new government to include his main
rival, Ayad Allawi, whose Iraqiya coalition won the most support among Iraq's Sunni minority. But Mr. Maliki
indicated he would move forward with or without Mr. Allawi, who has sharply criticized the power-sharing
deal.

"If we reach the critical area and we have to announce the government, we will go on with who is beside us,
who wants to be a partner," Mr. Maliki said.

Mr. Allawi, a secular Shiite and former Iraqi prime minister, has been offered a position leading a new strategic
policy council, but has not said whether he will accept the job.

For Mr. Maliki, the clock is ticking. He now has four weeks to cobble together a government that satisfies most
demands of the country's ethnic, religious and political factions.

He said he had sent letters asking the different coalitions for nominations for key government offices, and
would announce his ministers by Dec. 10 or 15.
