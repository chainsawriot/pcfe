Bill Clinton and Jean Max Bellerive to head the reconstruction committee

An Interim Committee for the Reconstruction of Haiti will be implemented in the coming days. It will be headed by former
U.S. President Bill Clinton and the current Prime Minister of Haiti Jean Max Bellerive.

This committee could be composed of 16 members including 9 foreigners. It should have the flexibility to make important
decisions in the context of rebuilding the country devastated by a powerful earthquake last January 12.

During 18 months, this new entity will manage the funds available to carry out all operations related with the
reconstruction of Haiti.

Under a plan presented by the Haitian authorities at a technical meeting held last week in the Dominican Republic, 11.5
billion would be needed to rebuild Haiti.
