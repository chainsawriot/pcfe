Subject: Hi Sis. My name is Roy Spence and I love you and

...I miss you a lot. And I have no idea how you keep on keeping on doing whatever it takes to lift people-everywhere up-
championing your Core Purpose of Fighting and digging deep for the opportunity for each person to be able to live up to
their God Given Potential. Here and Around the world.




The struggle for an Iran that is more concerned about its people than false power. The relentless quest to stabilize the
un-stable. The never give up journey to inspire and empower women and young girls to have a seat at the table of full
opportunity. The pursuit for opening doors of happiness for those who struggle with the unimaginable. The steady. The
Steadfast. The unwavering commitment to the dream-not the hope-but the dream of a better USA and world for all. The
tough and uncompromising "pretend leaders" whom you have negotiate with. The opinion rich and caring poor
arrogance of the mean spirited. The stuff that is on the news but is not really the real news.




The love and respect you give freely to all whom love life and liberty and opportunity for all.

The raw respect that you have earned in the trenches of real fears, real love and real longing for a village that is

Dedicated to raising a village and its children.




So I say to a beloved and dear love one-that be you-I love you. I respect you. I miss you. I cherish every moment of our
remarkable journey together.




God Speed. Dear Sis. We shall cross paths soon. And until then. Onward in all things.

Love

RS

Ride at Dawn.
