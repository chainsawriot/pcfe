BAKU (Reuters) - Turkey ally Azerbaijan condemned a U.S. House panel resolution on the 1915 killing of Armenians as
a blow to regional stability and to efforts to resolve a conflict over Armenian-backed Nagorno-Karabakh. The Azeri
parliament unanimously adopted a strongly-worded statement saying the resolution, which labeled the mass killings by
Ottoman Turks as genocide, "damages efforts to restore peace and stability in the region."
