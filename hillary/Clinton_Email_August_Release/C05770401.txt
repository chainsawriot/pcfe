Did you read all the way down? She died today.          #s are in the bottom email. She was a valiant fighter who
squeezed out a lot of life over a long time against tough odds. Here's to Judy and her indomitable spirit!

And, how are you, Dear One? I'm still seeing you and        in my mind's eye on the dance floor last weekâ€”showing
everyone how it's done! Let's hear it for the Sixties!! Much love to you all--xxoo H

Did you know about           I just talked to      who's at home.

I'm still recovering and need my own MOTB honeymoon!
