Thanks, Dan. This is great. Everyone was talking about it tonight at the Human Rights First reception at HRC. (And your
A/S was great, as always.) These things really do make a difference, and maybe we (meaning CGE, not you) could
challenge other foreign ministries to do it?! We have a meeting in a week with other national LGBT groups that work
with/lobby their foreign ministries, and maybe this could be an agenda item?

Thanks for sharing. We'll put on our blog now. Her saying you matter "to your country" is particularly
powerful.
