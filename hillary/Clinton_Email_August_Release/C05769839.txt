Sensitive but not classified

Jeff:

While speaking on phone today with FM regarding upcoming VIP travel to Egypt, he asked that I convey to the Secretary
that he is "amazed". ..tell the Secretary that "Ahmed is amazed" that she is going to Qatar and the Kingdom and flying
right over Egypt. I pointed out that S has been here twice and that they just met in the US last month.. .but he was
having none of it. .."just tell her 'Ahmed is amazed' that she would not stop here."

May I ask that you find way to convey this to S appropriately?

He also asked for detailed info on measures to be taken at our points of entry for incoming travelersâ€”key ministers very
upset at what they have heard, that there will be "no exceptions." We'll work with consular to convey the correct info
and try to calm this issue.

Cheers, margaret
