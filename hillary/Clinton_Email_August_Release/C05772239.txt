I solved the mystery on ralph thomson, the ceo of international business catalysts, who sent you letter and mentioned
his export conference this fall. You met him at the business roundtable lunch lorraine hariton organized on july 16th for
you and bob hormats. Ralph was invited because they include all past ACE winners on the invitation list (he won in 2007)
and he runs a small/medium size business which is a group they target for these roundtables. Lorraines office is in touch
with him on who would be appropriate to attend his conference.
