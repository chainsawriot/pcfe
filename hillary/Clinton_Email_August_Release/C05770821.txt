Jake- Huma-- a couple of matters I would appreciate your conveying to the Secretary orally-- or if you prefer you could
send them to her directly via e-mail.

Madame Secretary:

I have decided to go to Bolivia Monday night-- returning Wednesday. I did not add Bolivia to my previous Andean trip
because they were in the middle of elections




                                                                              these still have not been determined by
the administration.



Best, Arturo
