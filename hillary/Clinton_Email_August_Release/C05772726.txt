Cheryl


You have graciously facilitated a couple of meetings between me and Secretary Clinton and I need to express my thanks.


Today is my last day as the US Security Coordinator for Israel/Palestine and I would be grateful if you could pass my
appreciation for S's support these past two years. Our Ambassadors in Jordan and Israel think it would be useful for me
to give her a summary of where I see things after almost 5 years here in Jerusalem, but I do not wish to intrude.
However, should she want to chat, I will be on pre-retirement leave in the DC area until mid-November.


Thanks again for the assistance along the way.


Lieutenant General Dayton
