SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSFIED

HAITI

      •      Jack reported briefly on his conversations with Lowey and Oberstar on Haiti. Lowey raised two concerns: first,
             that we don't care about education in Haiti and, second, that we don't care about education in general. Jack
             pushed back on both fronts. He noted that Lowey also emphasized the need for accountability in what we are
             spending. Oberstar identified the type of trees that need to be planted for reforestation in Haiti, and said that
             the shift to propane gas won't work; we need instead to focus on providing the right sort of charcoal.

       •     H reported Friday's CODEL to Haiti has been cancelled.

Iraq

      •      Jack noted that we will set up monthly meetings on Iraq transition with the team here in Washington and the
             team in Baghdad. He also reported on a meeting with a two-star General and our DCM yesterday, in which the
             two-star complained about allegedly inadequate funding in our budget for transition issues in 2011. Jack said
             that the budget had been agreed interagency and DoD had endorsed it.

Middle East

       •




Northern Mexico

             Pat voiced concern over the uptick in violence in northern Mexico and possible threats to our employees, noting
             we were doing everything possible to keep our people safe.

PUBLIC AFFAIRS

       •     PJ said his description of recent Israeli designation of new heritage sites in the West Bank as "provocative" had
             attracted some attention.

       •     PA will put out a statement expressing concern over the Italian court decision against Google.

LEGAL AFFAIRS

     •    L, AF and others will send the Secretary a memo on the implications of the coup in Niger.




     *    Harold believes we are close to an understanding with the Canadian on the return of Khadr, if we can return him
          under the right terms.

     *    SecDef Gates has still not signed off on Article 75 of the First Additional Geneva Protocol. It may require another
          intervention by the Secretary.

     •    Harold suggested, if possible, that the Secretary make an appearance at the American Society of International
          Law in late March.

REGIONAL BUREAUS MEETING

10

     •    There will be a vote in the General Assembly tomorrow on a resolution on the Goldstone Report. The text is
          relatively moderate, but U.S. and Israel will likely be alone in opposing it. (Our friends in the Pacific have lost
          their votes for the time being because of non-payment of dues.)

     o    Human Rights Council begins Monday and runs for four weeks. Maria Otero will be there for the opening.

EUR

      •   Inauguration in Ukraine went without incident, though Tymoshenko boycotted the ceremony. Yanukovich has
          said he wants to visit Washington early on to focus on bilateral relations and meet with IMF officials.

EAP

      •   Jim Steinberg will travel to China next week. Chinese have made an official invitation. Will be no public
          announcement for the time being.

      •   Kurt Campbell will meet with Tom Donilon to discuss the President's Indonesia trip, preparations for which are
          not going well. The changing political climate in Indonesia has made them extremely cautious.

AF

      •   Yar'Adua's return to Nigeria has unsettled the political situation and sparked rumors of possible military
          intervention. WH is considering a letter from the President to Nigeria's political elite urging restraint and
          cooperation.

      •   On the good news front, the rapprochement between Chad and Sudan and the signing of a ceasefire agreement
          with the JEM represent real progress.

      •   Situation in Somalia remains poor, with reports of a likely TFG offensive in Mogadishu and a build-up of forces
          on both sides.
