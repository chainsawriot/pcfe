HRC,
As of April 21st Dave Stone's former business partner ( James F. Blom ), and I will establish 'Stone Harbour,LLC' (named
for Dave) in Delaware. This will be a nice merger of Dave's and my contacts. Apart from the ongoing vetting of Simon
Stringer's multi purpose software, at several levels, I am keen to help in the human trafficking effort. I have been in
touch with Sharyn Magarian (keeping Kris B informed) in seeking the status of that effort, as I am quite sure the combo
of Dave's former contacts and mine can help. Jim Blom has already spoken to several (Oracle Corp and his friends in
Silicon Valley) and they too are motivated. Work is work, but the human trafficking issue seems like the right thing to do.
All the best, Marty
