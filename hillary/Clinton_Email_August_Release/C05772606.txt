IRAQ BURIN (AP) - Palestinians say extremist Jews damaged their olive trees close to a West Bank village as the yearly
harvest of the important crop begins. Resident Bilal Eid said that two dozen men from a nearby Jewish settlement tore
at about a dozen trees after trying to attack Palestinians bulldozing an access road to their fields. The attack came at the
beginning of the 40-day Palestinian olive harvest. It's traditionally a time of heightened violence, as a minority of
extremist Jews try to provoke Palestinians. Eid said the damage could kill the trees, which were meant to be harvested
this week, near the village of Burin. A military spokeswoman said Israeli forces ordered the Jewish intruders to leave.
