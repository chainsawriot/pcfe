Monica said you asked about the camera

He is shooting broil for the interview you will do with Julia Roberts later in October - focusing mainly on women's issues.
By the time you read this they will be all done.

And FYI, the cameraman (Allan Palmer) and produce(Coby Atlas) might look familiar to you - they are from Tavis Smiley's
team, they did his special on you.
