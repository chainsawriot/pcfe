Subject: Stanford University Speech


Attached is a copy of the speech that I gave earlier this week at Stanford University. The focus of the speech was on
reviewing where we are and where we are heading with Mexico. It involves new analysis of the nature of the drug trade
and its impact on violence. Could you pass to the Secretary in case she has a moment to read it?

Carlos
