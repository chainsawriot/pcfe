we will not develop any position with respect to negotiations without Arab consensus whether
in terms of accepting or rejecting the US ideas.

With regards to resumption of direct negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis, NAR
said that there are no proposals (ideas) at present time to resume direct negotiations. He
said that the Arab and Palestinian position on this issue is clear; there needs to be a clear
TOR for negotiations and total cessation of settlement activities.   He said that the PA
position in principle is not against negotiations. On the contrary its for negotiations that
do not waste time since the Palestinian national interest requires a solution as soon as
possible to create the independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as capital. NAR went on
to say that before talking about resumption of direct negotiations, there is a need to
clarify the basis of these negotiations and to know the fate of settlements and to what
extent will Israeli abide by freezing settlement activities.

With respect to Israeli provocations which seriously tamper with security and stability, NAR
said that Israel does not want a return to negotiations but wants to blame the Palestinians
by saying they don't want to enter negotiations. NAR went on to say 'It is imperative to take
away this pretext by exposing the real Israeli position to the international community and
the US administration. He said we are ready to resume negotiations on clear basis but its
the Israeli side that places obstacles to avert meeting its commitments while blaming the
Palestinian side (as Israel is accustomed to doing).
