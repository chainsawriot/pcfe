Elections

With some 20 seats still undecided, Republicans have already picked up 61 seats in House; Democrats likely to
keep 51-53 seats in Senate. Spratt and Skelton losses are among more significant; H will prepare an analysis of
election's impact on our oversight committees. Murkowski appears to be headed for historic write-in win; her
support of Law of Sea and likely sympathy for New START will be good for us. Reid will likely return to
Washington energized by win to pursue consequential lame duck session. Manchin and Kirk will take up their
seats in the Senate this month; Rich suggests S calls to each to help lock in support for New START.

Other Congressional issues

Tom Nides' prep going well, and he'll see SFRC members and Sem Gilibrand this week. Rich expects
committee will vote him out during lame duck; still unclear if we'll get floor vote. An inter-agency team Will
brief the Hill this week on the President's Asia trip. Kerry will leave for the Middle East, including Syria, on
Sunday.

India

expectations.
