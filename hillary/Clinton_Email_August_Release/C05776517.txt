Subject: (AP) Palestinians angered over new Israeli construction

JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel is moving ahead with a plan for 625 new homes in east Jerusalem, angering Palestinians as
peace talks remain stuck over settlement construction. The plan received preliminary approval from a district planning
committee, which published an announcement on November 25. Further approval is required and construction will not
begin for about two years. Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said December 2 the move showed Israel had chosen
"settlements and not peace." The units are slated for Pisgat Zeev. While Israelis consider it a neighborhood of their
capital, the Palestinians see it as a settlement.
