Subject: CARE Policy Recommendations to Meet the MDGs

Dear Ms. Mills:

CARE is pleased that the international community will come together at the Millennium Development Goals (MDG)
Summit from Sept. 20-22, 2010, in New York, to recommit to and accelerate progress toward the achievement of the
MDGs by 2015. We also welcome the United States' Strategy for Meeting the Millennium Development Goals, "Celebrate,
Innovate and Sustain: Toward 2015 and Beyond." While we have made progress on some goals, we still have much to do
if we are going to meet these global commitments by 2015.

Attached or linked below are CARE's recommendations for meeting the Millennium Development Goals and for
strengthening the US' MDG strategy. Our recommendations include approaches and strategies proven to deliver results
specifically on MDGs 1, 3, 5 and 7. CARE's reflections on the MDGs are drawn from more than 60 years of experience
working with the poorest communities in more than 70 countries around the world. Women are at the heart of CARE's
efforts because experience shows that a woman's achievements yield dramatic benefits for her entire family and the larger
community. Promoting gender equality and women's empowerment is central to poverty reduction and the achievement
of all MDGs.

The MDG Summit provides a critical opportunity to take bold and decisive action. CARE believes that the following guiding
principles must be reflected in the outcome of the MDG Summit, in the US' MDG strategy, as well as in the US' and the
international community's implementation efforts:
    • An emphasis on meeting the needs of people in extreme poverty and the most vulnerable populations;
    • Promotion of gender equality, gender responsiveness, and the empowerment of women;
    • Adherence to broad-based country ownership, including broad stakeholder engagement with local communities,
        women's groups, and other vulnerable populations, in a whole-of-society approach to development;
    • Recognition of the linkages among the eight MDGs; and
    • A commitment to transparency, mutual accountability, and mechanisms to track results.
Any recommitment to the MDGs must be coupled with commitments to mobilize the necessary resources that will reach
the people who need them most. In the context of the US' development strategy, CARE also believes that USAID must be
empowered as the premier US development agency to lead these efforts, and we call on the Administration and Congress
to work together to reform and modernize US foreign assistance policies, efforts and strategies.

CARE urges bold efforts to recommit to the MDGs and ensure progress toward their achievement. The MDG Summit can
be the turning point in collective efforts to achieve the MDGs by 2015. It is critical that the global community unite around
a shared action-oriented strategy for meeting — and exceeding — these goals and begin to lay the groundwork for post-
2015.

CARE stands ready to support your efforts and looks forward to continuing valuable collaboration with the US government
and other leaders to tackle poverty worldwide. Please do not hesitate to call on us.
