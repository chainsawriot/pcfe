Subject: (Reuters) Palestinian leader vows peace, urges settlement end

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Palestinian President Abbas vowed on September 25 to do everything possible to make
peace negotiations with Israel succeed and avoided any direct threats to break off the talks over settlements. In a
speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Abbas said the Palestinians would expend "every sincere
effort" to reach a peace agreement with Israel within a year. He did not refer to the Sunday expiration of an Israeli
freeze on new settlement construction in the West Bank. However, he made clear that Israel would have to cease all
settlement activities if the direct negotiations with Israel are to succeed. "Israel must choose between peace and the
continuation of settlements," he said. Abbas has repeatedly threatened to break off the fragile negotiations with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the settlements.
