Cheryl or Huma, this message bounced back from hr15@att.blackberry.net, which is the only email address I've got for
HRC. Can you please make sure she gets it? Best wishes of the holiday to you both. Strobe

Hi, Hillary, and Merry Christmas. Hope you and the family are getting a bit of respite from it all. I'm sending you this
message because—somewhat to my surprise—Jairam Ramesh has asked me to pass along a personal message, which is
pasted below. I've known him since the 70s




Cheers, Strobe




Dear Madam Secretary of State:




It was wonderful catching up with you in Copenhagen. The opportunity to interact with President Obama and you at the
very last minute to salvage the Copenhagen Accord at the US-BASIC Summit Meeting was fantastic and unforgettable for
me personally. I am still reeling from that historic 75 minutes!!




With greetings for Xmas and best wishes for the New Year,




With warmest regards,




Jairam Ramesh

Minister of Environment and Forests

India
