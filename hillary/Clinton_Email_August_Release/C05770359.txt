Subject: (AP) - DPRK seizes ROK fishing boat amid tension

SEOUL - The Republic of Korea said authorities from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea seized an ROK fishing
boat in waters off the divided peninsula's eastern coast. ROK's coast guard said the fishermen were questioned for an
alleged violation of the DPRK's exclusive economic zone. The fishing boat was then taken towards a DPRK port. The
coast guard said it was not clear where exactly the fishing boat was operating when it was seized.
