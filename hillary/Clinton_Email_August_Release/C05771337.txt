NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's lower house of parliament on August 25 approved of a landmark bill to open up the
country's $150 billion nuclear power market, after the government agreed to tougher provisions that an industry group
said would hamper the sector's growth. The bill is needed for the entry of firms such as U.S.-based General Electric and
Westinghouse Electric, a subsidiary of Japan's Toshiba Corp, who are reluctant to step in without clarity on accident
compensation.
