        Diplomacy
        Before and After Conflict

                   onflict is a universal condition,' older than diplomacy. While conflict is a constant in

        C          human history, the nature of armed conflict, and especially the nature of 2P-century
                   warfare, has been transformed. General Rupert Smith identified these changes in his book
        The Utility of Force: "The ends for which we fight are changing; we fight amongst the people; our
        conflicts tend to be timeless; we fight so as not to lose the force; on each occasion new uses are found
        for old weapons; the sides are mostly non-state."2
             The nature of 21st-century diplomacy is also changing. To be successful, diplomats must simul-
        taneously shape, act upon, and react to global challenges. As Hans Binnendijk and Richard Kugler
        of the National Defense University argue, no single problem, danger, or threat holds the key to the
        world's future. What matters is their interaction and the simultaneity of our responses.'
             The definition of victory, too, is different today. Twenty-first-century national security suc-
        cess will encompass a comprehensive definition of security, and will be achieved by the broadest

          FCO: Well, there must be an international force, of course.

          MOD: And what would be the British aim in joining the force?

          FCO: To play our part as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.

           MOD: Is Britain to lead the force?

          FCO: No, it should be led by the UN—a proper UN mission.

           MOD: That will take some time to assemble, so it will probably be too late to stop the killing.

           FCO: Then the mission should be aimed at bringing postconflict order.

           MOD: OK. But we need to be clear how many British troops are currently available. Given our
                deployments in Ireland, Bosnia and a few other places, not many.

                to speed up the deployment of this force, offering a logistic unit would probably be the
                most valuable contribution.

            Many American diplomats will recognize this imaginary conversation, having participated
        in something like it dozens of times since the fall of the Berlin Wall. In the American debate, the
        issue also quickly focuses on who pays the bills. It is worth stating, at least in the American case,
       that officials at the Pentagon and DOD often were legitimately frustrated by the State Department's
        inclination to promote military missions for the Pentagon and the Armed Forces in an increasing
        number of situations that were important, but not vital, to U.S. national interests. While this readi-

        lack of civilian capacity to do the jobs required, it leads to understandable consternation among
        those in uniform.

        Diplomacy and Restoring Stability Following Conflict
             There are many issues—defeating extremism, promoting pluralism, bringing the benefits of
        globalization to those who have not yet benefited, living sustainably on the planet, nonprolifera-
        tion—that will be part of any definition of successful 21-century diplomacy. But getting postconflict
        diplomacy right--creating the conditions for a preclusive victory—may be the most crucial of all.
        This is not an easy assignment. The concept of success can be redefined after the fact, further com-
        plicating the assessment. Successful democratic governance and economic development cannot be
        delivered on a certain date, and therefore the need for time and patience is a necessity on the ground.
        However, patience is limited in home countries, and "fatigue" often sets in. Thus, the potential for
        failure is high. Industrial war produced winners and losers; today's lines are not so clearly drawn,
        and the timeline may be longer.
             Rupert Smith again brings clarity to this assessment:

           We intervene in or even decide to escalate to, a conflict in order to establish a condition in which the
           political objective can be achieved by other means and in other ways. We seek to create a conceptual
           space for diplomacy, economic incentives, political pressure and other measures to create a desired politi-
           cal outcome of stability, and if possible democracy. . . . if a decisive strategic victory was the hallmark
           of interstate industrial war, establishing a condition may be deemed a hallmark of the new paradigm of
           war amongst the people . 15
