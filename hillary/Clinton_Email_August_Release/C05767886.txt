I did talk to Ramesh this morning — he called, unscheduled.

Jake:


I got the readout from the Secretary's call to Indian FM Krishna, and I understand that she will convey India's
support for Copenhagen to the Brazilians.

Right after the call, the MEA sought to clarify a key point, which moderates Krishna's message. According to
the GOI, the Ministry wants to underline that while the Minister had conveyed to the Secretary India's "broad
political support" for the Copenhagen Accord, it was not yet ready to be "listed" as a party to the Accord. But
the GOI also understands that the listing process is a priority matter.

I also understand that Todd Stern talked to Jairam Ramesh, the Indian Minister of Environment. I have not
heard a readout yet, but Todd may have more information about
