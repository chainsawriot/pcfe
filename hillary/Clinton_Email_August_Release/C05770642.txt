                                             April 20, 2010

          The Honorable Kent Conrad, Chairman
          Committee on the Budget
          United States Senate
          Washington, D.C. 205.10

          Dear Mr. Chairman:

                I am asking yourrhelp in supporting the State and USAID budget- request for
          FY 2011. 1 appreciate the difficult budget envimnment that confronts the
          Congress, but I strongly believe this budget request is critical to advancing U.S.
          national security and our interests around the world.

                 Our request totals $52.8 billion — a $4.9 billion increase over 2010. Of that
          increase, $3.6 billion goes directly to "frontline states" — Afghanistan, Pakistan,
          and Iraq. All other State and USAID funding grows by $1.3 billion or a 2.7
          percent increase, and allows us to tackle the transnational problems of poverty.
          food insecurity, climate change, and disease that pose serious threats to American
          interests.

                 Our diplomatic and development tools alliance American leadership,
          strengthen our alliances, and build new partnerships to confront pressing global
          challenges. Full fimding in FY 11 will allow (LS to continue making tangible
          progress in securing the hard fought gains achieved in 'Iraq, and to continue
          supporting and deploying hundreds of civilians in Afghanistan and Pakistan to help.
          stabilize dangerous but improving situations.

                 The recent attacks on United States persOnnel and facilities from Juarez.
           Mexico. to Peshawar, Pakistan, reinforce what we already know -- America's
           diplomats and development professionals are on the front lines, protecting. and
           securing our vital national security interests around the world.

                  Congress has rightly demanded that we use all the tools in our national
           security tool belt; that we put more diplomats and development experts on the
           ground, shoulder-to-shoulder with our troops; and that we do everything possible
           to secure America's interests aroun.d the world.. We are doing our part at the State
           Department and USAID, but we need your help with the FY II request. Our

          missions are increasingly integrated with those of our Defense Department
          counterparts, as we have seen demonstrated time and again in Iraq, Afghanistan,
          and other parts of the world. Cuts to the civilian components can no longer be seen
          in isolation or having little impact on our national security strategy.
                 Our investments in development and diplemacy are smart, cost-effective,
          and squarely in the best interests of American taxpayers and our national security.
          They are also relatively small compared to the cost of active military engagement,
          and they can end up delivering impactful savings. In Iraq, lbr example, our $2.6
          billion request for State and USAID will allow the Defense Department budget to
          decrease by about $16 billion — a powerful illustration of the return on civilian
          investments.

                 I ask ibr your strong support of our budget request and you have my pledge
          that we will work diligently to ensure that this funding is used as efficiently and
          effectively as possible.


                                                 Sincerely yours,




                                                 Hillary Rodham Clinton
