Yep, one of my plans is to bring all the girl effect people together to get their ideas. Maria is definitely on the list.
I'm off to Italy but reachable.

It's a great idea. I think this woman Mari Eitel can be helpful given what they did with the girl effect video.

Hi there, I will be on vacation (FNALLY), but reachable. Just have your guys work with Anita in my office to set up a time.
When I'm back, I want to talk to you about a couple of personnel issues too. I love H's idea aboit girls and we're already
thinking about it.
