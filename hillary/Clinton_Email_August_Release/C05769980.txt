Subject                          meeting with the Danish Foreign Minister



You are scheduled to meet with the Danish Foreign Minister on Friday. The Danes are interested in partnering with the
US on a side event at the Kabul
Conference focused on Afghan women. I think this has potential and I'll raise with SRAP, but wanted you to know -- in
case it comes up in your meeting.
When I met with a couple of the Afghan women who participated in the recent peace jirga, they told me that it would
send a very strong message if a large group of women representing Afghan civil society could meet with you when you
are in Kabul for the conference. I don't know if it will be possible to arrange such a large gathering, but perhaps
something significant can be arranged.
