Madame Secretary:
On flight home from Kampala, which was exhausting                                           I am sending Info memo        B5
Monday, but whatever you hear, the big picture is this:

To become operational, any crimes of aggression
1. must still be affirmatively revoted by two thirds votes of states parties
2 no earlier than 2017
3 there will be another review conf probably before this goes into effect 4of the two ways of referring crime one goes
through an exclusive sc trigger;
5 the other branch has
A a prior sc filter *and*
B an ex post sc red light plus
C requires full vote of 9 judges of pretrial division and D nonconsenting aggressor states can opt out and E prosecutor
must have reasonable basis for investigation under definition which F has now been significantly narrowed




I can elaborate Monday
Best
Harold
