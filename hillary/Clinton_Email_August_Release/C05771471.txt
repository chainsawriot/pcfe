Subject: (AP) Aged Saudi ruler to fly to the United States over blood clot

RIYADH (AP) - A senior Saudi official says the kingdom's aged ruler will fly to the United States for "medical tests." The
official says King Abdullah will leave the kingdom on November 22, three days after he was admitted to the hospital
suffering from back pain due to a blood clot. The 86-year-old Crown Prince Sultan, who himself spent over a year in the
U.S. and Morocco for medical treatment and recuperation, will arrive at Riyadh on November 21 to oversee the
kingdom, the official said. The official spoke late November 20 on condition of anonymity because he was not
authorized to speak to the press. The palace said November 19 that King Abdullah was hospitalized after a blood clot
had created pressure on the nerves surrounding a ruptured disc.
