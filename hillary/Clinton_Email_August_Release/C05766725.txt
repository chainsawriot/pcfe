Interesting observations from Declan:

Foster was a critical component in the talks apparently. However there is already speculation that PR may use this
moment to try to come back early and resume position of FM given that the other investigations have been delayed
pending the outcome of the police investigation. He went to London with his family yesterday to visit his wife, who is in
a clinic there apparently.

Empey still not on board apparently so the "community confidence" round may be used to put pressure on him to do so.

Our intervention on Thursday night/Friday morning was seen as a very important moment/catalyst. That, coupled with
the jobs losses that day and the fact that the radio and tv phone-in lines and newspapers were full of commentary
supporting what we said, seems to have made people realize, that they couldn't lose the moment.
