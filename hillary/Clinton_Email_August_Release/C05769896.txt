BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan (AP) - As minority Uzbeks flee the Central Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan by the thousands, Russia is
sending in a battalion of paratroopers to protect its air base in the country. More than 100 people have been killed and
about 1250 wounded in four days of ethnic violence spreading across southern Kyrgyzstan. Doctors and rights activists
say the actual toll is likely far higher than that official count, because wounded Uzbeks are too afraid of being attacked
again to go to hospitals. Mobs of ethnic Kyrgyz have been reportedly torching Uzbek villages and neighborhoods,
slaughtering residents. Authorities in Uzbekistan says more than 75,000 refugees have fled its neighbor. Most are said
to be women, children and the elderly, and many have gunshot wounds. While the Kremlin has refused Kyrgyzstan's
request for military help quelling the violence, the Interfax news agency reports Russia has sent about 300 paratroopers
to reinforce security at its air base. Kyrgyzstan hosts both U.S. and Russian military air bases, but they are in the north,
away from the ethnic rioting.
