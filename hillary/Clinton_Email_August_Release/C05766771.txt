I thought I would share this heartfelt message from Patricia Lamego de Teixeira Soares, the head of Brazil's Central
Authority, the office responsible for Hague Convention abduction cases. You will see that in spite of our efforts to
protect the son, the Brazilian family chose to make a spectacle outside the Consulate this morning by parading Sean
through a crowd. Ms. Lamego recently visited the U.S. where she met with members of Congress and others to explain
all that the Brazilian Central Authority was doing to reunite Sean and his father under the Hague Convention. The
delays we saw in this case were largely the result of a wealthy, well connected family able to influence court decisions.

We are all relieved and thrilled to see this long overdue but very happy ending. I should also highlight the amazing
work done by US Mission Brazil. The consular staff, Charge, Acting DCM (Marie Damour, the Consul General in Brasilia),
LegATT, RSO, and a host of others all played a role in this successful return. My OCS DAS, Michele Bond, and her
dedicated team also played a big role in communicating with David, his lawyers, Congress, and the press. We had
Members of Congress, former Assistant Secretaries and US Ambassadors all pitching in. While there were
disagreements at times over tactics, we all agreed that we were working towards the same goal: the safe return of
Sean.

We particularly appreciate the strong support from the Secretary. Many people will try to take credit for today's happy
reunion but it was the Secretary's continued concern and interest in this case that made the difference. We could not
have provided a better gift to David Goldman during this season of giving.     Janice

Dear All,

The Goldman case finally came to an end, and despite the efforts of all involved the hand over of the child to the US
Consulate in Rio was transformed into a deplorable display of the child walking in the streets with the maternal family,
being exposed to the media and to the public that surrounded the consulate.

I'm sorry this had to happen but it seems that Mr. Sergio Tostes, the matemal family's attorney, did not feel at all
embarrased to use and expose the child, who was probably under severe stress, in order to gather support for his
position. This most despicable man is not accepting the fact that, despite his life long relationships with influential
authorities in Brazil, he was unable to win the case and Sean is finally being reunited with his only real father.

(just hope that David and the Goldman family find enough time to recover their lives and their relationship with Sean.
They need time more than anything else and now it is up to the US government to guarantee that David Goldman will not
have to face the maternal family once again in the US courts where, according to Mr. Tostes last declaration to the
Brazilian press, he will "fight to defend the child".

Please allow David Goldman to live in peace with his son and have the life that he deserves after fighting so much for so
many years.

In my name and in the name of all the staff of the Brazilian Central Authority I wish David, Sean, and their family all the
best and a most happy life once they are finally back in the United States.

And to all of you who worked so much in support of this case, our deepest gratitude. We wish you all a Merry Christmas
and a very Happy New Year.

Best regards,

Patricia Lamego T. Soares
