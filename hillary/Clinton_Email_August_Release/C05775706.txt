I'm more worried about whether Amb CM behaved! I told her no table-dancing or karoake singing. How'd she do? It's a
great idea and Chicago was the perfect place to start. Has spring finally come or are you still covering plants and
worrying about the frost? I'll try calling later for an update. xxoo

Attended Ambassador Capricia's event last night at the Art Institute. It was a magical evening.
                                                   We sat with the ambassador from Guyana and the ambassador from
the Philippines. Lovely people. A staff from the Dept of State sat with us: Gladys
hope she would report that we behaved. A lovely idea this field trip for the big guys/gals.
                                  â€”ambassadors pretending that they were more excited about going to the Merc.
Rick's group doing a great job. Now if only the weather would cooperate. We had 2 1/2 inches of rain this morning.
