Contacting with wha now. Frattini would have to cancel his trip so we would have to re-schedule for another date or just
do in context of one of these multilateral meetings. He has a big speech in italy on the 26th.

Can you ask WHA to work for times so I can fly up mid morning and return late afternoon. Could I see Frattini next day?
What seems best?
