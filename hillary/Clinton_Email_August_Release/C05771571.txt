RAMALLAH (Reuters) - Israel must halt settlement building on occupied land if peace talks are to resume, a senior
Palestine Liberation Official said after a meeting of the body's executive committee. "The leadership confirms that the
resumption of talks requires tangible steps, the first of them a freeze on settlements," Yasser Abed Rabbo said after a
meeting in Ramallah. "The Palestinian leadership holds Israel responsible for obstructing the negotiations," he added,
reading a statement issued after the meeting.
