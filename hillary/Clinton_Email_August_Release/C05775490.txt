RABAT (Reuters) - Morocco has suspended the activities of pan-Arab Al Jazeera television on its territory, Morocco's

would take immediate effect and that the accreditations of the Qatar-based television station's staff in Morocco would
also be suspended. It did not give any reason for the decision.
