It appears that he wants to raise some sensitive issues with you - so it's hard to do up a specific call sheet.

A few minutes ago we received a phone call from the Foreign Ministry advising that Foreign Minister Judeh would like to
speak with the Secretary today, at any time that is convenient for her. King Abdullah II will be meeting tomorrow with
Abu Mazen, and there are some issues concerning the meeting that FM Judeh wishes to discuss.




I advised the FM's office that I would relay the request and advise them of the response. They are awaiting a return call.




Many thanks,

         Larry Mandel




U.S. Embassy Amman




Embassy Amman's work week is Sunday through Thursday. Amman is seven hours ahead of Washington time.
