Jake, Huma: Could you let the Secretary know that I met with Chairman Reyes this afternoon at his request, to talk
about Tuesday's trip to Mexico and the High Level Group. He indicated he might be speaking with the Secretary very
soon on this. He was very pleased with the Secretary's leadership of such a high level delegation, the support for
President Calderon's efforts, and the attention Mexico and the border is now getting, and had spoken yesterday with
Secretary Napolitano. He stressed that he thinks we should be doing more for Mexico (he mentioned only wanting to
get funding for Mexican improvements to ports of entry). I ran intc                        going in as I was
leaving,           expressed some frustration at Mexican positions during yesterday's meeting, but was extremely
grateful for the US participation and the Secretary's leadership. We agreed to get together very soon to review "action
items" coming out of the meeting.

Many thanks, Roberta
