Subject: a couple of powerful quotes from foreign media which we highlighted in our cable

- VEJA MAGAZINE, BRAZIL (Jan. 25, headline of a two-page article showing
U.S. servicemen walking in front of destroyed buildings in Port-au-
Prince): "Better with them, impossible without."

--CHOSUN ILBO NEWSPAPER, KOREA (Jan. 25): U.S. involvement in overseas
natural disasters is a 40-year-long humanitarian tradition. . . In a
disaster-stricken area, the military is more systematic and effective in
carrying out a relief operation than any other group."

-- EXPRESSO NEWSPAPER, PORTUGAL (Jan. 24): "In critical moments of the
history of mankind, over the last 100 years, the United States is, in
fact, the indispensable nation. Sometimes for bad reasons and, other
times, as in Haiti, for good reasons."
