Should I make a statement in briefing room on Monday? What about Sid's comment that Shaun would want to talk to
me tomorrow?

Missed Shaun, but was just on the phone with his COS, who said there are still some details to be worked out Monday.
She "wouldn't put a full stop on it," but things are looking very good.

Looks like tomorrow will be a down day and then they'll reconvene Monday to try to bang out the last details and
announce.

Re: NI breakthrough

Shaun has just called meâ€”about 9 p.m. EST. He says it is very likely that an agreement will be announced on Monday.
The parties have reached agreement tonight. Shaun will call you on Sunday to brief. Gordon will fly into Belfast on
Monday for a ceremony if all goes according to plan now. He will mention your role. You should be prepared to speak to
the parties before the event and issue a statement. Hope it doesn't come unraveled over the next 36 hours.
