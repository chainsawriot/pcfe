Great to hear.

I'm also now working on a final round of edits from Jack, Eric, Raj, and others -- also trimming and improving the flow of
the speech a bit. You'll get this revised draft tonight. If you think it is improved, we'll use it, or we can use the draft you
made your changes to, if you'd prefer.

Lissa will be in the office tomorrow to handle your edits.

You will have a teleprompter.

No reason that I know of not to include Zuma; I will add a reference.

Thank you!

Thx for your work on the speech. I have a few edits which I can bring in tomorrow to make changes.
Megan, if you're not there, who will do them?

Also, do I have a teleprompter?

Is there a reason we don't mention Zuma in the para on S Africa?
