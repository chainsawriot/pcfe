Jack—

Thanks for flagging this. We actually saw this last night, and Vikram and I had a conversation with Richard about it. The
report was based on interviews conducted in May-June, before the new policy change was implemented, so much of the
report is already OBE. OIG gave us the draft report in October, and SRAP/SCA/INL immediately sent a joint response to
OIG (attached), highlighting that we were already working on many of the issues highlighted in the report.

Given the change in policy and our letter to them, we found it pretty egregious that the OIG didn't report on the changes
underway or adjustments already made, as the report is being portrayed in the press as currently applicable. Michael
Keays on the Afghan desk and Peggy, who both help to oversee CN issues, are already working on a letter to OIG
expressing our strong concern about the report and the process which got us to this point, and Vikram and his team are
ginning up press points which also note that we have already begun to robustly address many of these points (I've cc'ed
them all on this).

If you'd like to talk further, I'm happy to come up to your office at some point this morning to discuss.

Dan
