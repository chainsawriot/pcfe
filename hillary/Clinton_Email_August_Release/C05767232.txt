 SANAA (AP) - Security officials say Yemeni forces have killed two suspected al-Qaida militants in a raid outside the
capital. The officials say security forces attacked a group of militants, which included Nazeeh al-Hanaq, a senior figure
on Yemen's most wanted list. The clash took place on Monday as the militants were moving through the mountainous
area of Arhab. They say al-Hanaq escaped but two fighters with him were killed in the clashes. The officials spoke on
condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press.
