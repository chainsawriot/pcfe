I'm copying Rob so a note can be prepared.

FYI - will get Rob to write him a note unless you already did one for his own graduation.

Cheryl:

Graduation Ceremony for Academy kids is Friday, June 11th, at 630pm. At our Shaw Campus. 1851 9th Street, NW

You might want to let the Secretary know that                 is going to be the graduation speaker. My guess is she
can't come, but maybe she'd want to drop him a note. If so, let me know, I'll draft something for.
