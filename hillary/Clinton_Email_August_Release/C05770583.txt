To All:

Latest we have on following is that GOJ plans to make an announcement at 9:30 EDT tonight that govt is proceeding
with extradition request. Separately, we are hearing that government may move to arrest him very soon â€” even tonight
or tomorrow. Coke could well resist, so this could turn violent. We will see what the announcement says and then take
stock. Even if govt announces, the follow-on legal process is lengthy.

KINGSTON, Jamaica - (AP) Police say businesses in Jamaica's capital have been closing early as rumors spread that the
government has signed extradition papers for Christopher "Dudus" Coke, a man described by the U.S. as a major drug
kingpin. Police commissioner Owen Ellington says officers are monitoring the situation and there is no threat to public
safety. Local media say the government has denied signing extradition papers.
