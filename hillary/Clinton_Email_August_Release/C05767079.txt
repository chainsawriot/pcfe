Subject                            Status of Yemen 1206



I just asked Ops if we might be able to talk for a minute before your 10:45 call with Sec Gates. The call is on a different
subject, but the Yemen 1206 package may come up and I wanted to brief you where things stand as of this morning. It
was on his desk for signature yesterday and I asked that it be pulled back so we could work through some last issues
today. I was planning to touch base with you before signing off. Thanks.
