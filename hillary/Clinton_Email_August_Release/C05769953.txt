June 26. In London, onwarding to Moscow.... Thought FT interview turned out well even if exposed Dan's ignorance
about airplanes (he doesn't know the difference between a 727 and a 777!).

Thx so much for your quick and thorough followup. I'm not surprised that he believes he has to wait awhile. Let's aim for
a time to catch up. When will you be back in DC?

Hillary, as promised, I connected with Bruce Jones at NYU about Spanta. Bruce got in touch offered to help Spanta put
together an arrangement at NYU that might have a Brookings offshoot. Spanta said he needed to decide with Karzai
whether in fact the timing was right for him to leave. He just got back in touch with Bruce saying he's decided to stay on
a bit longer. That said, he's agreed to participate in some Track II regional work that Bruce has underway. All in all, it
sounds as though this has ended up in the right place for now. Bruce, Martin and I will be open to other NY/DC
possibilities down the road when Spanta's situation changes. Thanks again for the truly terrific event at Brookings.
Regards, Strobe
