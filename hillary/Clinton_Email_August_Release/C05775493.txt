Subject: (Reuters) Vietnam to award Japan nuclear plants deal

TOKYO (Reuters) - Vietnam has decided to award Japan contracts to build two of four nuclear power plants it plans to
set up by the early 2020s, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. Prime Minister
Nguyen Tan Dung is expected to relay the Vietnamese leadership's decision on October 31 when he and Japanese Prime
Minister Naoto Kan meet for bilateral talks at a regional summit in Hanoi, Kyodo said. Earlier this month Japan said it
had agreed with Vietnam to cooperate on nuclear power plant technologies and materials. Japan, the world's third-
biggest nuclear power generator after the United States and France, is stepping up efforts to tap the nuclear power
development market overseas. In an effort to sell its atomic technologies abroad with the help of the government, a
joint venture of 13 Japanese firms including Toshiba Corp, Hitachi Ltd and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was formed this
month.
