First, Happy New Year to Jen and Stern clan. Hope to talk soon about our way forward for 2010.

I received the following email from Jairem Ramesh over the holidays. I intend to respond in kind but wanted to run by
you for advice.

Thx. HRC---



Dear Madam Secretary of State:




It was wonderful catching up with you in Copenhagen. The opportunity to interact with President Obama and you at the
very last minute to salvage the Copenhagen Accord at the US-BASIC Summit Meeting was fantastic and unforgettable for
me personally. I am still reeling from that historic 75 minutes!!




With greetings for Xmas and best wishes for the New Year,




With warmest regards,




Jairam Ramesh
