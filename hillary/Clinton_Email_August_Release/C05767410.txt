Subject:                     Gates on Armenian Genocide Resolution



"Our view is that the negotiations that have been taking place between Turkey and
Armenia offer a positive path for the future. Anything that would impede the
success of those discussions and negotiations I think is objectionable and I
would just leave it there."

    --Secretary Gates, News Conference, Ankara Turkey, 2/9/10 (Response to
question: Do you think it will be helpful to US-Turkish relations if the Armenian
Genocide Resolution passes?)
