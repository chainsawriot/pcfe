Sean has not yet arrived at the consulate.


David Goldman, Rep Smith, David's attorneys and Mission personnel all safe at Consulate. Still set for 9am handover.
Consulate will allow Sergio Tostes, attorney for the Brazilian family, into the building along with Sean and his
grandmother, Silvana. We have arranged for the party to enter directly into the building via the garage. The
grandmother announced to the press her intention to "park 3 blocks away, as the consulate would not allow her in" but
press are quoting the Embassy spokesperson Orna Blum flatly contradicting that statement, emphasizing that for Sean's
emotional well-being, and in sensitivity to Silvana and David, the reunion be safe, private, and calm.

Court officials and the attorney for the GOB, Daniel Levy Alvarenga will also be at at the consulate to assist in the
turnover.

    •   It appears there will be no handover tonight. According to David's Brazilian attorney, the negotiators have
        broken up, having not been able to agree on the issue of the Grandmother accompanying Sean to the U.S. on
        the plane (clearly, the other side remains unaware of the source/nature of the charter flight that is pending a
        handover). We have rebuffed attempts by the Brazilian family's attorney to "get clarification from the
        Americans" as an obvious last-ditch ploy to once again present this as a U.S. vs Brazil issue. We have been clear
        to all parties that we the Mission have absolutely no role in any negotiation between the parties and will
        not/not undertake any contact with the family or their representatives.
    •   Deadline for handover established by the President of the 2nd Regional Federal Court in Rio remains 9am
        Thursday morning at the U.S. Consulate. Brazilian Central Authority confirms that the warrant authorizing
        enforcement of the order has been issued and should be in the possession of law enforcement should the family
        not comply. BCA has confirmed they will be in early tomorrow morning, ready to arrange enforcement should

        that be necessary. However, David's attorney believes they will comply with the order and appear at the
        Consulate. We stand ready for multiple scenarios.
    •   In good news, the Brazilian Central Authority reported that the judge assigned to hear the two motions filed by
        attorneys for the Brazilian family in the Superior Tribunal de Justica (STJ) has denied both motions on the merits,
        not just refused to consider the motions. Links to the decisions for those who wish to read legal Portuguese are
        provided below.
    •   The frequently-announced press conference by the Brazilian family/their attorney never materialized. We await
        word on their next public relations foray.
    •   We will stand down support staff in Rio at an appropriate hour so they can get some well-earned rest, and be
        prepared to start again early tomorrow morning.

Subject: RE: Goldman Decision - update as of 13:00 local time
Importance: High

I have just spoken with the Brazilian Central Authority regarding the orders imminently coming out of the office of the
President of the 2nd Regional Federal Court. He is evidently interpreting the lifting of the stay imposed at STF to mean
that the 48 hour period provided in the appellate court decision to the Brazilian family to turn over Sean to the
Consulate has started ticking again — not restarted at the beginning, but resumed ticking. According to the Court, the
deadline for turnover at the Consulate falls at 6am local time on Thursday morning, December 24. Because of the early
hour, he will evidently order the family to turn over Sean at the consulate NO LATER than 9am on Thursday, December
24. However, he will also recommend, not order, that the family turn over Sean at the Consulate today/tonight in order
to permit him to travel to the U.S. on an overnight flight and spend Christmas with the family in the U.S.

There is current debate ongoing regarding the timing of the turnover. Daniel Levy of the AGU office in Rio will evidently
take the lead in negotiating that turnover, in conjunction with David's legal team.

Press contacts are stating that Sergio Tostes, the attorney for the Brazilian family, has called a press conference at 2pm
local time (11am DC time) to announce voluntary turnover. No further details on that yet.

Will pass more information as soon as we have it. Planning for all contingencies.

Subject: Goldman Decision - update as of 10:30 local time
Importance: High

Good news this morning:
   • Brazilian Central Authority reports that at lam local time today, the attorney for the Brazilian family contacted
      Daniel Levy, the AGU attorney representing the Brazilian Govt in this case, to inform him that the Brazilian family
      is willing to arrange for voluntary turnover of Sean at the Consulate General in Rio. Daniel Levy reportedly
      replied that he would only facilitate these discussions on the condition that there were no further legal
      machinations to delay implementation of the court order, and that the turnover happened today. We do
       not/not know what if any conditions the family will try to place on a voluntary handover, so planning for police
       execution of the court order continues.
   o Interpol office in Brasilia has assured BCA and the Embassy LEGAT that they are fully aware of the status of the
       case and are ready to provide support if Sean is not turned over. They will have action if the family attempts to
       hide Sean.
   o We have contacted WHA Press and CA Press separately to discuss timing to release statements if/when we are
       successful with wheels up.
   O We have discussed detailed contingency plans should the police be called upon to go to the family residence to
       enforce the order if voluntary handover does not occur. Also have plans in place to supplement personnel in Rio
       should this extend past today.
    O   We have a general sense of the timing of potential events: We expect to have more clarity from the attorneys
        as to whether or not voluntary handover will occur around noon/1pm local time, which is 9/10 DC time. Should
        police enforcement be required, that will likely mean mid/late afternoon local time. We will advise asap if this
        timeline shifts (as it is likely to do, this being Brazil.)

We will try to send updates every 2 hours or so, even if nothing of note has occurred. As always, please advise if there
are any specific questions or concerns.

I have just heard from the team in Rio that there will be no return enforcement this evening:

         enforcing the return of Sean Goldman to the U.S. He will wait there pending coordination with relevant police

        and judicial authorities to ensure that everything is ready, and they will depart for the family compound to take
        custody of Sean.
    •   Consulate General Rio will have cars ready at 9am for transport, and the team will be ready at the airport to
        facilitate departure.
    •   David's attorney has spoken to judicial authorities and believes that the motions filed at ST1 will not be accepted
        by the court, so will not interfere with the return. This does not preclude some last minute legal maneuvers, but
        he seems confident that the decision by STF will effectively cut off other avenues. We will advise asap if this
        changes.

Blackberry service does appear to be down, so if there are any questions tonight, please contact me directly on my cell
at                   as I am getting offline in approximately five mins. We are 3 hours ahead of DC time at the
moment, but please do not hesitate to call.

Subject: RE: Goldman Decision - update as of 00:45 local time

Given the hour here, I am less optimistic that we will pull off a return tonight, but we are still working to that end.

    o   The Brazilian Central Authority confirms that the office of Regional Federal Court President Paulo Espirito Santo
        has received the decision of STF President Gilmar Mendes. It is Paulo E-S who will be responsible for enforcing
        the decision from Mendes, i.e. the return of Sean Goldman to the U.S.
    o   BCA has promised to reinforce for Interpol the urgent necessity of police in Rio monitoring the location of Sean
        Goldman. Embassy LEGAT office is double-tracking. We cannot, of course, ask them to enforce anything until
        the proper judicial authority has sent them instructions, but we strongly urge them to be prepared.
    •   BCA has turned over operational jurisdiction to Daniel Levy, from the AGU's office in Rio, to coordinate with
        David Goldman's attorney and with the court in Rio. I have asked David's attorney to try and get some
        understanding from Mr. Levy as to the timeline we can expect to see in this case.

What remains unclear:

    o   We do not know if the judge from the Regional Federal Court intends to issue an execution order from his home
        tonight at this late hour, or if he will wait until opening of business tomorrow morning. Note that 00B here
        generally means 10am for a court. This only underscores the need to ensure that there is sufficient monitoring
        of Sean's whereabouts.
    o We do not know how Judge Paulo E-S will interpret an "immediate" return order — it could mean right this
        instant, or it could mean some brief period of time where the family is ordered/encouraged to turn Sean over at
        the Consulate or some other site.
    o We are working to obtain some sense of whether this is likely to happen tonight, or if we are better served
        getting some rest now and starting first thing 00B which for us means 7-8am.
    (1. We have not had confirmation regarding the resolution of the motions in STJ, but frankly, I don't foresee
        receiving an answer on that before mid-day Wednesday.

PLEASE NOTE — I am aware of the intense interest back in DC about this case and will be passing information just as soon
as I receive it. This means that in most cases, I will not be able to confirm the information. Will try to identify credible
sources vice what rumor/press/others are saying.

Brazilian Central Authority (BCA) coordinating with David's attorney and the Federal attorneys in Rio to ensure that the
President of the Regional Federal Court in Rio has a copy of the STF order and is submitting the official request to federal
police to enforce. BCA says they still believe they can effect the turnover tonight and are at their office working to that
end. If/when the Federal Police enforce, their stated preference is to go to the airport and effect the handover
there. This is a scenario we've planned for.

BCA has mentioned the STJ motions filed by the Brazilian family as a potential obstacle, but thru their contacts in
Mendes' office at STF, have heard that Mendes intends to reach out to the reporting judge at STJ to resolve that
issue. As mentioned in an earlier update today, we have not had any confirmation that the STJ judge has accepted to
hear the motions filed by the Brazilian family, and has the option to decline to hear them.

If the family sees the writing on the wall (frankly unlikely at this point) and agrees to abide by the order of immediate
return, then in theory the handover would happen at the consulate and there is a plan in place for that.

Plans in motion to prevent them slipping away and Patricia Lamego is working with the police as we speak. Federal
Police repeatedly assured us they were prepped and ready to move but could take no action absent an order. They
know now there is one, so BCA will get them moving.

If the handover occurred tonight, I'm told we need 3 hours to get the plane off the ground, so overnight in the hotel.

Marie, if there is a handover tonight: that would be at the Consulate in Rio, right? Grandparents would bring Sean and
he'd spend the night...in David's hotel or at the Consulate?

It seems very, very unlikely that will happen tonight.


But if handover is delayed until morning, the family may try to slip away tonight. Can we ask the police to prevent that?

Here is what we know:

    •   STF Pres. Gilmar Mendes upheld the motion by the AGU and David's attorney requesting he overturn the stay
        imposed by Justice Marco Aurelio, based upon a motion filed by the maternal grandmother.
   •    The order at first read appears to require immediate return of Sean.
   •    The BCA is calling the Interpol director responsible for enforcing such actions to see if they will get set to
        move. HOWEVER, BCA does not/not yet have a copy of the order, and it is the judge in the lower court in Rio
        that would generally receive the order from STF and then contact DPF to enforce.
    •   Sergio Brito, the prosecutor who has assisted David's attorney on the Hague case is attempting to contact the
        judge in the court of first instance in an effort to move as quickly as possible. Note that the court of first
        instance is on recess and the "duty court" judge will need to take action, but magistrates in Rio are keenly aware
        of the status of the case and may be prepared to move this evening.
    •   BCA is hoping to effect handover tonight, and will plan to send their psychologist to Rio if the handover must
        happen tomorrow morning.

What we don't know:


    •   No details yet on what else is contained in the order, which is likely to affect the next steps taken by the
        Brazilian family.
    •   No details as yet on what, if anything the Brazilian family has done in response to the news from STF.

Embassy staff are in the room with David's Brazilian attorney and will report just as soon as we have any details to
offer. Please advise me if you have any specific questions we need to pose to the team.
