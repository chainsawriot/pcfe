I don't know where to begin as you are our beginning and middle and I cannot imagine our end without your quiet but firm
wisdom, careful candor, and watchful eye for the Secretary and all of us who have joined the department to have a
chance to help her and those who work so hard in this building make a difference.

Her success to date is yours - I hope you know that as we are so very cognizant of that.

I look forward to visiting you as you give your leadership to greece on b/h of our country.

More importantly, I look forward to an enduring friendship.

Thank you. For everything.

Cheryl,

         I just wanted to say what a pleasure it has been working with you. You are a wonderful Chief of Staff and
Counselor, and I have learned a great deal from you. I am deeply indebted to you for my onward assignment and,
Senate willing, hope to welcome you to Athens soon. In the meantime, I know Steve Mull and the Secretariat will
continue to do all they can to support you and the other members of the Secretary's senior leadership team. If I can
ever do anything for you, please don't hesitate to ask. All the best, Dan

representatives of "embattled NGOs" in the balcony of the Slowacki Theater, and many were literally awe-struck. They
told me that it was the most important, most inspirational speech they had ever heard relating to civil society. I agree.

I realize that considerable behind-the-scenes work goes into a speech like this. While civil society has an important role
in critiquing governmental actions, I also think that it's important to recognize the efforts of our remarkable colleagues
in government. So please allow me to say "thank you" to you and your team. Please also know that you can count on
ICNL to redouble its efforts - within the CD Working Group and otherwise - to advance the objectives set forth in
Krakow. Indeed, I've already met with the Working Group and have reached out to other partners to ensure that civil
society properly complements the tireless efforts you and your team have displayed in protecting civic space around the
world.

With best regards,

Doug
