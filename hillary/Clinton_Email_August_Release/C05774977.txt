Ag Comm Ron Sparks Cell
              .. Sparks was vocal, active HRC supporter. He traveled to some other states, participated in nearly all
Rural Americans for Hillary conference and strategy calls, offered ideas and encouragement and was always ready to
speak on your behalf. He's a smart, energetic politician.
