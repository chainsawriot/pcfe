He allegedly has 2 remaining concerns:

1 - getting an updated 1251 report (10 year plan) (she can tell him we will do some kind of update...may just be a letter
but we will agree to udpate);

2 - and he still has concerns about verification. For the last 30 days, we have tried to connect him with rose g and ted
warner from DoD. Looks like that will finally happen next week. They can and will alleviate his concerns (we hope).

That's what I know. I am sure he will be pleased to hear that we had a constructive meeting with Senator Kyl and are
moving to meet many of his funding concerns.
