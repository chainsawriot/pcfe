Further to my e-mail below on the killing of an LES, her spouse, and another LES spouse from our Consulate in Ciudad
Juarez, names have now been released and a few more details:

Colleagues —

Passing on the latest information (received at 2150) from PO McGrath. The name of the deceased American Citizen
Services LES is Lesley Enriquez. Her husband, killed in the same attack, was U.S. citizen Arthur Haycock Redelfs. The
name of the surviving Fraud Prevention Unit LES is Hilda Antilion. The name of her deceased husband is Alberto Salcido
Cisneros.

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS REPRODUCED FROM THE CONSUL GENERAL'S EMAIL: RSO Greg Houston is seeking
to make arrangements to return to post tomorrow. Post management will try to schedule a town hall meeting for all
staff, the meeting to be held at the Consulate at the earliest feasible time tomorrow or Monday (a Mexican holiday).

We just held a town hall meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the anticipated Mexican travel warning/authorized
departure/compensation issues. We also briefed the staff on a Wardens Message we were making yesterday about
trouble anticipated this weekend at what is believed to be a cartel-owned or —associated nightclub located very close to
the Consulate General. There is concern within the Consulate community that the attacks today were a cartel response
to the Wardens Message. At this time we have no indication that this linkage with the Wardens Message exists, and
there is information that in the case of Ms. Enriquez and her husband the attack was a case of mistaken identity on the
part of the cartel hit squad.

Our information on the Salcido/Antillon incident is still largely incomplete. Although the fact that both families had
attended the same social event earlier in the afternoon suggests some kind of linkage between the two attacks, so far
we have not been able to make a determination one way or the other as to whether such a linkage exists.

See below for a developing story coming out of Ciudad Juarez — one LES (locally engaged staff working for the
consulate), her spouse, and another LES spouse were killed today, apparently by a drug cartel. The details we have are
below, but more are coming.

Subject: FW: LES incident in Ciudad Juarez

Colleagues,

Ciudad Juarez Principal Officer Ray McGrath called Ops at 2050 to report two killings involving LES employees.

Earlier on March 13, drug cartel hit teams fired upon two separate privately owned vehicles at two separate
locations. The incidents happened between 1400 and 1700 local. In one vehicle, the husband of a LES was killed. In
the second, the LES and her husband were killed. Both LES were at the same social event before the hit. The PO is
working to find out if anyone else is at risk.

PO McGrath said colleagues in El Paso state there are some indications that the attack was a case of mistaken
identity. A vehicle of similar make & model is being targeted by the cartels.

RSO Greg Houston is currently in Monterrey, but is working with his A/RSO to send a spot report. RSO Houston's is
reachable in Monterrey at

Both LES were State FSNs. Ops is attempting to obtain their names.

Gregory Macris
Senior Watch Officer
