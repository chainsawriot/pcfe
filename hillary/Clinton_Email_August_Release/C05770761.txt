FYI â€” from Morningstar:

The Turkey-Azerbaijan Agreement was not signed last week in spite of both leaders having said that it would be.
Erdogan and Aliyev are now saying June 7 or 8. We have learned that a serious commercial arose that needs to be
resolved. I hope it will be but am making no predictions. One could also speculate that Medvedev's visit to Turkey may
have been a factor. S should be aware of this. Thanks... Dick
