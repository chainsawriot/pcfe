Subject: (WSJ) Prosecutors Focus on Mahmood Karzai, Posing Diplomatic Risks for Washington

Federal prosecutors in New York said one of Afghan President Hamid Karzai's brothers, Mahmood Karzai, has become a
focus in a corruption probe. The Southern District of New York has a history of charging, extraditing and trying suspects
in far-flung parts of the world, including Afghanistan. Prosecutors are trying to determine whether they have enough
evidence to bring charges of tax evasion, racketeering or extortion, said U.S. officials.
