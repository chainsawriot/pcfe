Please pass to the Secretary




Madame Secretary,

I wanted to follow-up with you on my earlier note about the security situation in Monterrey. We have been working
very closely with Pat Kennedy to assess all of our options. Pat has shown tremendous flexibility and has provided
excellent counsel.

As we looked further into the Aug 20 shooting incident at the American School, it became clear that there many
competing versions about the causes behind the incident. We decided that it is best to leave this matter to local law
enforcement officials and to concentrate our review on whether it is possible to provide adequate security for the
children of U.S. personnel in Monterrey.

Our discussions with police and other security officials made clear that local police and private patrols do not have the
capacity to deter gangs and cartels from areas around the schools attended by the children of U.S. personnel. Local
authorities, we found, are not able to respond in a predictable and effective manner to calls for assistance. Given the
increasing level of violence that is occurring all over Monterrey, including near where our children go to school, we
determined that the only immediate, practical, and reliable way to reduce the security risks for all children is to relocate
them to the United States.

We are working with Pat Kennedy on the appropriate mechanism to formalize these arrangements. I have also advised
Secretary Espinosa and Nuevo Leon Governor Medina that we are moving in this direction. In parallel with this, I
recommitted to our Mexican counterparts that we will continue to do everything possible to support their efforts to
improve the security environment in Monterrey and other parts of the country.

Thank you for your support on this matter.

Carlos Pascual
