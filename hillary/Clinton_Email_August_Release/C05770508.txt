(AP) Egypt: basis to move to direct peace talks lacking

CAIRO (AP) - Egypt says more work needs to be done to bridge the gap between Israel and the Palestinians before they
can move to direct peace talks. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
met separately with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo. None of them spoke to the press afterward. But
Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit told reporters the basis to move from indirect to direct talks is still
"lacking."
