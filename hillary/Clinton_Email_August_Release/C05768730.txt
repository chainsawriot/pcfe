Barb--

 I loved your comments at your re-election kickoff and hope you've scared off all the would-be opponents.

 How's our friend, Martin, doing? I know he has a rematch when he should be reelected by acclamation for steering the
ship of state so well. Pls give him my best wishes.

  And go get 'em! Your friend and booster, Hillary
