RAMALLAH (AP) â€” Saturday's statements seemed intended mainly as a new warning that Washington's peace efforts are
in trouble. The Palestinians sharply criticized Israel's plans to build 238 more homes in east Jerusalem. Palestinian
President Abbas met with leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization and his Fatah movement at his headquarters in
the West Bank. The Palestinians plan to study their options in coming days, said Yasser Abed Rabbo, the secretary
general of the PLO. "These political options include going to the U.N. and to the Security Council," he said. Mohammed
lshtayeh, a senior Fatah official, said the Palestinians will have prepared options by the time they consult with the Arab
League in three weeks.
