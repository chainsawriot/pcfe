Today's tumultuous session of Iraq's COR culminated with the election and swearing in of Jalal Talabani as President,
and the immediate nomination of Nuni al Maliki as prime minister. Of more significance was the election of leading
Iraqiyya member Osama al-Nujayfi as speaker of the Council of Representatives. This represented Iraqiyya and Sunni
buy-in to the new, inclusive Government. As the newly nominated Prime Minister, Maliki now has 30 days to form the
Council of Ministers, which must be approved in the COR by absolute majority.                                         1.4(D)
                                                                                                                             B1
These developments were marred by a theatric walkout by lraqiyya. Members of Iraqiyya had called for a motion to
cancel de-Baathification proceedings for Saleh Mutlaq and two others to be added to the COR agenda in advance of
voting on the presidency.
