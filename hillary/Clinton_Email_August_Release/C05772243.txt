Subject: (Reuters) U.S. VP Biden visits Iraq as troops withdraw

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Vice President Biden arrived in Iraq on August 30 as U.S. troops prepared to end combat
operations on August 31.

   Biden was expected to hold talks with Iraqi leaders during a period of political deadlock, almost six months after an
inconclusive election in March, over forming the country's next government.

  His visit comes at a time when Iraq is on high alert for attacks by insurgents after a series of bombings that killed
dozens of people and underscored the fragility of Iraq's recent security gains.
