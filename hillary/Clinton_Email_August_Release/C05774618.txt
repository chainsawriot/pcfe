I have asked Jose to get you a more detailed report but I must tell you the opening of the USA Pavilion has been a great
success so far - at least among the expo-goers. A few vignettes.

- while we don't want to brag to our Chinese hosts, our Pavilion has become the most popular. During the trial runs last
week, the Chinese expo-goers rushed directly from the gates to the USAP (and even broke some of our turn-styles).
Needless to say, the Chinese have improved security. On EACH of the first two days, 30,000 pple visited. Lines are long
and pple are loving the show. We are also getting many foreign officials to visit.

- the 100 US college student ambassadors (who act as guides and speak Mandarin) are the biggest hits of the pavilion.
Fair-goers stand in line to have their photo's taken w them. They explain the show and send a great message.

- the story line that we thght was simplistic is quite popular (the overture where Americans try to say hello in mandarin
is met w howls of laughter and Act II called the Garden is doing well). During the thunderstorm scene a mist comes from
the ceiling and some pple put up their umbrellas. Act I is a bit too commercial but the audience claps and take photo's
when you and President come on the screen.

- we are selling tons of USA merchandise - the two most popular items - mini-basketballs with the USAP seal on it and
the bison stuffed animals - who knew?

Anyway, thght u'd enjoy the quick report. I cannot imagine us not being here! We will keep you posted.

Smart power works!
