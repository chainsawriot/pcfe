We have such a strong case. Can we try to get Sibelius and Vilsack on board?

The National MSPP is just the Ministry of Health for Haiti at the National level (Minister Larsen's office). We spent a long
time with him and




We plan to discuss the USG contributions next week and in the April 26th meeting with the MSPP.




                                                         In our TA strategy that ( attached in the original email), we

outline the areas we can specifically support them in developing the capabilities needed to be a strong oversight
National office of Health that can lead and support the Department ministries in carrying out the work.

Right now we have committed to talking further with the Cubans about reconstruction efforts and in further clarifying
the role they would play with HUEH. There are many areas we could work together with the Cubans that would be
beneficial to the Haitian medical system. You will still have the opportunity to call final package. We will make sure we
are clear where our proposal overlaps with the final vision of the Haitians and other donors.




Whole of Government Approach:

Thank you for this and for coming — I am very grateful.




I have always understood that while GOH appreciated Cuban doctors and training
                                               I understand that frame, and assuming they have physicians and
managers, it makes complete sense.




What I still feel like is a bit of a mystery to me, though I know once Dalberg has the proposed final strategy, they will do
a careful implementation plan at the direction of you and Judith, is what exactly this means for USG specific activities.
