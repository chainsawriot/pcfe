Hillary,

Sandy Weill called me Monday. He is eager to speak with you and asked that you give him a call.

He has spent time in recent weeks in the Middle East and has feedback for you on how people there feel, where they
want to go and how that affects the relationship between the US and countries in the Middle East. Sandy is not a
newcomer to the region and very much wants to share with you what he's hearing. He's a fan and wants to be helpful.

I promised him I would pass the message. His number is

Xo,
Lisa
