Blogging on the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling is more of what we love about the web. It's the kind of typical
collective dissection we have now come to expect but that never really existed before: serious, speculative, arcane, funny,
brilliant, baked, etc. The Sunliaht Foundation b!000inci is predictably good. Paul Blumenthal dips into the multinational
dimension of the new "corporation as full citizen-person" framework, drawing on blogging going on at Neytsweqk and the
CerAer for Pubiic inte'r'.
"Looks like [the Court] might support allowing foreign companies to spend freely in elections in the United States. I guess
this would be the corporate globalization of the U.S. electoral system." So you gotta ask yourself: Who does Hugo Chavez
want for President?
Blumenthal excerpting the Center for Public Integrity:



             The Center for Public Integrity looks at this closer and shows what kind of foreign influence we are
             looking at:
                           One prominent examples is CITGO Petroleum Company — once the American-born
                           Cities Services Company, but purchased in 1990 by the Venezuelan government-owned
                           Petroieos de Venezuela S.A. The Citizens United ruling could conceivably allow
                           Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who has sharply criticized both of the past two U.S.
                           presidents, to spend government funds to defeat an American political candidate, just by
                           having CITGO buy TV ads bashing his target.
                           And it's not just Chavez. The Saudi government owns Houston's Saudi Refining
                           Company and half of Motive Enterprises. Lenovo, which bought IBM's PC assets in 2004,
                           is partially owned by the Chinese government's Chinese Academy of Sciences. And
                           Singapore's APL Limited operates several U.S. port operations. A weakening of the limit
                           on corporate giving could mean China, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and any other country
                           that owns companies that operate in the U.S. could also have significant sway in
                           American electioneering.
             I really can't see Americans being too happy about this.
       ha Lithwick reported :rC(' .ate from the Supreme Court as the opinions were being read. She offered this aside:
             While Stevens is reading the portion of his concurrence about the "cautious view of corporate power" held
             by the framers, I see Justice Thomas chuckle softly.
Was it a disdainful chuckle at the impotence of his colleague? Was it merely a chuckle of disagreement, of good-natured
exasperation? Was it a chuckle at an anachronistic vision of the framers set beside today's modern corporate silicon and
steel behemoths? I doubt he was thinking about Hugo Chavez.
