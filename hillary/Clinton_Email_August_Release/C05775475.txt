You r doing a great job — if you weren't pushing...I could not imagine where things would still be with the IDB.

It will still be slower and more painful than all of us would like (but that is the nature of these processes as we know),
but things had no focus that I could see until you got involved and I think we might have lost the belief that it could work
without your determination.

Really — you are doing a great job and I admire and respect your efforts and don't know how you find the energy given
I'm sure all of the other demands you must deal with. You are making a difference here and that is what it is all about.

Please don't bother replying again Cheryl — I know how busy you must be.

Just keep going!

 I know right — me too. I am trying not to be too pushy but could not agree more.

 On election day I thought folks should get up early and vote and then get to the call!

That is very encouraging the necessary analysis for the proposed site selection is completed. If Hansoll is interested
would there be anything in writing available on the additional analysis on 14/15 or does that need to wait for the full
assessment now being undertaken for Site 15?

Please also add going forward to the email list for Hansoll —Jenny Yu —                        I added her on my                B6
reply. You can delete

I can make the call tomorrow morning.

Subject: Update on North Park Meeting with President Preval and Request for Call on Tuesday - 2 Nov - 7am

All

I just wanted to give a quick update on the productive meeting we had with President Preval and his team of advisers
yesterday, including Gabriel Verret, to discuss a number of critical issues to move the project in the North forward.

The GOH has identified site 15 as the preferred site with which to move forward. This decision is based on the incoming
analysis from the IDB on flood risk & drainage, as well as soil and water studies. These studies point to better soil quality
and drainage on site 15 as compared to 14. Importantly, the analysis did not point to any flood risks.

The site decision enables the IDB to immediately move forward with the in depth environmental and social analysis,
which includes a water systems assessment to shed further light on quantities and quality available. President Preval
Identified site 14 as the back-up site should the assessments point to any unforeseen risks to the development of a
viable park in this location.

I think it makes sense to undertake a call on early Tuesday morning to review the status of the project, address
outstanding issues, and get an update on this week's conference. I have again attached the overall timeline of the
project and note that a number of deliverables are lagging and require greater attention to meet the agreed target of
beginning construction in January 2011.

I would suggest a call at 7am Tuesday morning given our multiple time zones. I have copied Joanne and would be
grateful if you could RSVP as to the availability of the appropriate representatives from your team to participate at this
time. Thanks so much.

Best
