Subject: Request for S phone call

Jake,

I just got off the phone with A/S Feltman and he asked that I send this note to you. I am the Charge' at Embassy
Amman.

A few minutes ago we received a phone call from the Foreign Ministry advising that Foreign Minister Judeh would like to
speak with the Secretary today, at any time that is convenient for her. King Abdullah II will be meeting tomorrow with
Abu Mazen, and there are some issues concerning the meeting that FM Judeh wishes to discuss.

I advised the FM's office that I would relay the request and advise them of the response. They are awaiting a return call.

Many thanks,
        Larry Mandel




U.S. Embassy Amman
