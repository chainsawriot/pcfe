Jake;

We have been informed that Senator Kerry and Governor Richardson each met with FM Bruno Rodriguez
yesterday and today, respectively, in NY. We are trying to get a readout of the Kerry meeting but am
assuming he intends to call S directly. Governor Richardson has asked to meet with me tomorrow morning. I
will send you details of that conversation tomorrow. thanks. Julissa
