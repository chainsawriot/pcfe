Dear Secretary:




I was pleased to learn about your development speech this week, and offered the insights below to Anne-Marie earlier
today. Overall, it's a very good speech, and I look forward to hearing you deliver it tomorrow.




4.      Mike, through Dan Baer, and I provided language to ensure consistency with the Human Rights Speech.




Thank you,

Maria




Under Secretary of State
