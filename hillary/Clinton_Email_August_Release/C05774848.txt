Subject: (Reuters) White House believes START treaty will pass Senate

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said on November 17 he believes a new START treaty
with Russia will gain enough votes in the U.S. Senate to pass before the end of the year.

  Gibbs said he believes an end-of-year session of the Senate will take up the arms control treaty and will be voted on
and "we'll have the votes to pass it."
