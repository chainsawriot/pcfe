WASHINGTON - Jelani Freeman has gone through a lot to wear this robe. This weekend, he will graduate from Howard University Law
School.

He remembers the shaky foundation of his young life. A mother who could not take care of him. He lived in six foster homes in ten
years.

"Moving to these different homes. The kids were like 'you weren't here yesterday.' Where's your mom at'?" said Freeman.

At 18 years old, he left the system and went to college in search of room and board. He knew what people expected of kids in the foster
care system - not much.

"All I would hear is that they were in jail or homeless or weren't doing too well," said Freeman.

He beat the odds and graduated, but he felt ... alone.

"I can distinctly remember walking across the stage in undergrad. You know at graduation everyone has their cheer section that yells as
you walk across the stage and there was almost silence as I walked across," said Freeman.

It will be different this time. When Freeman gets, his diploma Saturday at the convention center, there will be 26 people - friends and
supporters from as far away as California - in D.C. to show their support.

Freeman also got a boost from an internship program for kids who have spent time in foster care. He was placed in the office
of then Senator Hillary Clinton. Clinton even mentions him in the updated version of her book "It Takes A Village."

Now, he may use his law degree to work on public policy - especially children's issues. He wants all kids to know: "There's a bright
future out there for you if you stay focused and work hard."

And to the adults who hear his story, Freeman said help a child. He is living proof of the difference it can make.
