Subject: update on 10 arrestees

TF5 rec'd a call from                                               reporting about 10 arrestees. Says they are currently
in the justice building near the airport.

I called            He gave me these contact numbers:
Driver
(wife of arrestee

Group also called Haiti Sharing Jesus Ministry, Inc. Orphanage run by Haitian priest              Church from Meridien,
Idaho already supported this orphanage.                 contacted Idaho church   and said that he could no longer care for
the children. The group had already started construction of an orphanage in Cabrete(sp) in the DR. The plan was to take
the children to Cabrete and house them in a hotel the group had rented until the orphanage was complete.

They were arrested at the border, waiting for permission for the DR consulate to take the children into the DR. It is not
clear if they were seeking permission to remove the children form Haiti.

       states that the 10 have been "sentenced" for kidnapping. A asked if meant charged, but he said sentenced.
