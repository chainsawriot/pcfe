Subject: Can you be available for call from PDT Preval this p.m.?

CDM:
At behest of PDT, I tried to call you just minutes ago to ask about your availability for phone call from him this afternoon.
- First choice: 5:00 p.m. (your time)
- Alternative: 7:00 p.m.
- If neither works for you, then propose time and we'll accomodate.
Two options to suggest:
1. With our individual cell phones, it is difficult to involve third person - to wit, me. Could you arrange for a conference
type number and code to which PD and I could call separately?
2. Or as alternative, do you have capacity to call us separately to turn it into a conference call?                      1.4(B)
Either option would not only make for a smoother conversation, but would also allow me to not have to be in same1.4(D)
location as PDT.




                                             so best that call be today.

                                                                                                                             B1
