Cheryl: Thanks to you and Hillary, Madam Secretary, for a great day for local government. If I had script authority for
today, I couldn't have done any better. Please pass on to the Secretary; that on behalf of local government, we'll hold
up our part of the partnership. We have a lot to do, but I am very excited that we covered some significant mileage
today. Please let me know if I can be of any assistance, you'll let me know. Thanks again....

ps. Local Government, WORLDWIDE, was a big winner with Reta Jo today, and didn't even realize it, thanks.
