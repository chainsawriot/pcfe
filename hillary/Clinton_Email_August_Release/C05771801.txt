Subject:                           Wikipedia;trip



I have been monitoring the wikipedia situation and working with the R team to try and be as prepared as we can.

I am heading to Indonesia on Monday for the opening of the new American Center and then to Malaysia where, among
other things, I plan to work with Paul Jones on the English language initiative.

I will be traveling all day Monday so unfortunately out of touch for about 18 hours. I will be in contact with my office as
soon as I land and can always cut the trip short if necessary, although, under the circumstances I think it is important to
keep to our schedules.

As we have discussed, one of the main drivers of our PD strategy is to ensure we have strong relations in all sectors to
help us weather the invitable storms in our relationships and at this point it looks like we have a hurricane on the
horizon.

Take care and look forward to seeing you when we both get back.
