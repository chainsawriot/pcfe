Subject:                         follow-up



MS â€” I asked Huma about the Jackie Newmeyer/October 20th e-mail.., she does not know what Jackie is referring to and
also says that we have "cleared that day" for you.
Also, I passed forward to Huma and Eric that you would like to know details regarding the November 17 Women's Law
Center honoring Melanne.
