JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas expressed condolences in a rare telephone call with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu December 4 over the deadly fires raging in northern Israel, Israeli officials
said. The two leaders were not believed to have spoken since they last met in September when U.S.-backed peace talks
stalled in a spat over Jewish settlement construction. A statement from Netanyahu's office said Abbas "expressed his
condolences to the people of Israel on those who died in the fire and said he would be happy to provide any necessary
help."
