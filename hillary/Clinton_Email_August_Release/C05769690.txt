Subject: Costa Rican presidential election

Ruling party private exit polling shows Laura Chinchilla ahead with 44 percent. Two opponents in the 20s. If that holds
(she has to get over 40 percent to avoid a runoff), we will have our fifth elected woman president in recent Latin
American history. Chinchilla is same party as Arias. Will keep you posted. ck
