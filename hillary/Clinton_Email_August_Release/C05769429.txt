I don't know, people make big deals out of nothing, rather than subscribe to Occam's Razor

I have to look it up but I think you said you never noticed, probably because it's when you're not on the plane

I'll double check

But why did he make such a big deal out of it? And what did I say when he asked?

He asked you about this when you sat down. The press hangs in the Andrews DV lounge and gets on the plane well
before you, the Air Force must have had Fox on when he was with us.

I just saw an article he wrote in USA Weekend claiming we had FOX on our airplane screens. What is he talking about?
He makes a big deal out of it.
