Subject: Russian tycoon Khodorkovsky gets 14-year sentence (AP)

MOSCOW (AP) - A judge sentenced jailed Russian oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky to 14 years in prison
following a trial seen as payback for his defiance of Vladimir Putin's power. Judge Viktor Danilkin handed
down the sentence after convicting Khodorkovsky of stealing oil from his own company and laundering the
proceeds. Khodorkovsky is in the final year of an eight-year prison sentence. His lawyers say the new sentence
is counted from his 2003 arrest and includes his previous term in jail.
