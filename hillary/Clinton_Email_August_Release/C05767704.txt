Hillary:
I had planned to meet with you on water after returning from Bolivia's inauguration - there is so much we can do.
Haiti is beyond what one's spirit can absorb. I am grateful that my former colleagues from ACCION, missing until friday,
are safe.
Best,
Maria

Maria, Anne-Marie and Cheryl,

 March 22 is World Water Day (who knew?) Could we have a policy ready to announce by then? I have some ideas so
