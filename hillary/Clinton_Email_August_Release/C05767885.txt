Thanks for taking my call and it is nice to reconnect with you.

As discussed, I wanted to officially notify you, as a matter of courtesy, that former Secretary Rice will be
traveling to China (Hong Kong, Sanya, Beijing), March 19-23 to participate in a couple of events and for
business/commercial purposes.

In Hong Kong, she will be speaking at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In Sanya, she will be speaking at
the Boao International Tourism Forum. In Beijing, she will call upon current Chinese officials with whom she
worked during her time in office. The Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs (CPIFA) are serving as her
hosts in Sanya and Beijing.

We are not requesting any assistance or support from the US Mission in China. However, if you could let Post
(Front Office / RSOs / Consulates) know of her travel plans we would be very appreciative.

Also, if it is not too much trouble I would like to establish personal contact with the RSOs just as a
contingency. I will be the POC for this trip, so feel free to pass my contact information on to the appropriate
individuals in the event they have further questions, etc.

While in country she will be staying at:

Hong Kong: TBD
Sanya: Sheraton Sanya Resort (basing out of for the day)
Beijing: The Ritz-Carlton, Beijing
