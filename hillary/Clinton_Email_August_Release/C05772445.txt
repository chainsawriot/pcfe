is so wonderful. Brilliant pick. Every time I meet with her I like her more and more and she is really the right pick for
ECA. She brings so much to the table that we need. Everyone here is so pleased with the selection and the fact that R is
equally pleased is even better â€”that we can both think she is "ours" is a testament to Ann. It may have taken a long time
but it will be well worth the wait. She can take ECA in a new direction. And if she has the help of Joe Macmanus she can
do it even quicker and better (I can't pass up a good plug opportunity!).
