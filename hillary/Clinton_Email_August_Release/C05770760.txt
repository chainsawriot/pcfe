A new Buffalo Bill is catching the world's attention.

On the practice field Tuesday afternoon, he was just another Bill, a rookie no less, but he's
catching a lot of attention in his family's homeland.

In China this week, during a speech to dignitaries at the USA Pavilion, Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton said this:

"From Yo-Yo Ma to I.M. Pei to Commerce Secretary Gary Locke and Energy Secretary Chu,
Chinese-Americans have achieved great success in business, government, the arts, sciences and
sports. And to that end, I was pleased to hear that the Buffalo Bills have recently drafted the
first Chinese-American to play in the NFL," said Clinton.

Buffalo Bills offensive tackle Ed Wang said, "It felt good. She's a very important person, and so
for someone like that to talk about me, it just feels good."

Wang didn't know until he heard from News 4 that he was mentioned in Shanghai. The 6'5", 250
pound Bills rookie wasn't born in China, but both of his parents were Chinese Olympians in track
and field, so he loves breaking new ground in football.

>Â»In George's reporter's notebook, he explains why the Buffalo Bills limit media access to the
first 15 minutes of practice

"It is important to me just because I am the first, and I take a lot of pride in being Chinese, but
at the same time, I know that I'm out here to play football," said Wang.

Wang is expected to make the team, and his goal is to make a difference.
