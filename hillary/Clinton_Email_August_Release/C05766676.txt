 Re: NI breakthrough

 Shaun has just called meâ€”about 9 p.m. EST. He says it is very likely that an agreement will be
 announced on Monday. The parties have reached agreement tonight. Shaun will call you on
 Sunday to brief. Gordon will fly into Belfast on Monday for a ceremony if all goes according to
 plan now. He will mention your role. You should be prepared to speak to the parties before the
 event and issue a statement. Hope it doesn't come unraveled over the next 36 hours.
