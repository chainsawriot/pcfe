My mom just wrote me an email about the interview that captured exactly what I thought watching the interview - you
have been through so much and would have been perfectly entitled just to pack it in after the election but instead, in my
mom's words, "instead of feeling sorry for herself she takes the ball and runs with all the energy that she can summon in
the service of her country to the limit of her body ....and she dishes it out frankly without pussy footing around whether
to heads of State or media or major international conferences." I felt VERY proud to be on your team. AM
