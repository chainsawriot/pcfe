Subject: Update on PSA

Morning all, wanted to update you on where we are with the PSA for Pakistan that we produced in conjunction with Ad
Council. You can view the PSAs here: http://multivu.prnewswire.com/mnr/adcouncil/45926/ - please note this is NOT
public yet.

The Ad Council is releasing the PSA @ 1pm today and we will be sending (once approved) a press release out as well
linked to state.gov where the PSA's will live. There are TV, Radio and Web versions of the PSA cut into 30 and 60 second
spots.

We still are working through some music and image questions with the Ad Council to secure international distribution.
We are waiting to hear from them on this. Once we hear, the Ad Council will make some minor edits to the PSA e.g.
removing the Text Donation information as it applies only to Americans and re-send the files with the revised transcript.
Once we have that, then we can move forward translating into local languages. The Ad Council said they will need an
additional 2 to 3 days to make edits but again I am waiting to confirm.

 Hope this update is helpful. Please let me know if you have questions. Best, Katie
