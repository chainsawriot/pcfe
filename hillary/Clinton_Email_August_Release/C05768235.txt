Subject: (AP) Kyrgyz leader: no guarantees for ousted ruler

BISHKEK - (AP) The head of Kyrgyzstan's interim government, Roza Otunbayeva, said the deposed president must face
trial, rescinding an earlier offer of security guarantees for him. Otunbayeva and others had earlier offered ousted
President Bakiyev a safe passage out of the country if he resigned voluntarily. Bakiyev, speaking to Russian media from
his home Jalal-Abad region in southern Kyrgyzstan, urged the United Nations to send peacekeepers to Kyrgyzstan to
prevent unrest from spreading.
