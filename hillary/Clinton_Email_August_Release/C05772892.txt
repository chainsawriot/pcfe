Dear all:

To update you, at G we have been working on water and World Water Day (the event planned takes place at the
National Geographic Building), since I am taking on water as the key issue I am/will working on. I sent S a memo on
water in December outlining our plans. Note that we are mandated to report to Congress annually as part of the "Water
for the Poor" Act.

I have met with Kern-Ann, with OES "water" staff in the last weeks to address this and also with several regional bureau
A/S (Carson, Feltman, Blake so far) on water in the respective regions.
There is a great deal of interest on their part and we have started outlining specific initiatives that we could focus on.

We've also met on the Nile Basin Initiative, with World Bank "experts" leading NG0s, McKinsey, etc. I've also spoken to
Raj (USAID allocated about $480 million in FY 2009 to water, and MCC about $500 million) but of course he has been
unable to focus on this. And Cheryl and I haven't spoken yet about Food Security/water.




Best,
Maria

Maria, Anne-Marie and Cheryl,

 March 22 is World Water Day (who knew?) Could we have a policy ready to announce by then? I have some ideas so
when we all get a chance to breathe, let's discuss. Here's to H20.
