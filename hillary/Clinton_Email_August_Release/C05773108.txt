It has gotten incredibly positive coverage in the region. Hbi just called to praise it, and Hossam Zaki said that Aboul-
Gheit thought it was "perfect". The timing was serendipitous -- the day after the latest Nasrallah screed (where you and
I were mentioned by name), thus pushing Nasrallah aside in the media. Maura Connelly reports that Hariri was pleased.
We got big bang out of this.

This was the written interview where you met the journalist and took the photo.

That's what my clips say. Was this taken from public statements?
