Subject: (Reuters) ROK to hold emergency meet on economy after attack

SEOUL (Reuters) â€”South Korean President Lee Myung-bak called an emergency meeting early November 25 to check on
the economic impact from the worst North Korean attacks on civilians in the South since the 1950-53 Korean War. The
presidential office said the meeting of senior security and economic officials was due to start at 0800 local (2300 GMT
November 24) but did not provide more details. Local media reported the meeting was aimed at discussing ways to
prevent tensions with North Korea from hurting the economy, which is becoming more reliant on domestic consumer
spending for growth as exports are beginning to lose steam.
