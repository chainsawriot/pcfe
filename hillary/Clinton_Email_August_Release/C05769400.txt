Cheryl:

FYI. I understand that Susan Rice and the Secretary discussed UN Haiti operation. Susan subsequently asked me for my
views on the organization of the UN tsunami operation, with a view toward enhancing the effectiveness of the current
effort on Haiti. I have lots of thoughts — as the operation needs to be much, much stronger institutionally — which I will
share with her on Monday.

Eric
