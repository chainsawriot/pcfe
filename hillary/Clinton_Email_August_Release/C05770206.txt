During the past year we have discussed the size of the Germany PD budget and the fact that it did not reflect current
priorities. EUR reviewed the budget and made the decision to cut the German PD budget by 30% and reallocate the
funding to other areas, primarily Eastern Europe. As you will see from the email below and the attached memo, Mission
Germany responded by reviewing all their PD operations and developing an entirely new approach based on the PD
strategic framework we rolled out earlier this year. I think they did an excellent job and we will be using this as a model
for other Missions as we go forward.

Let me know what you think.

As you know, PA Germany has taken a huge budget hit. We have lost one-third of our PD funding and, as a
result, PD LES staffing has been reduced by almost one-third. Dealing with a cut of this magnitude is never
easy — it was particularly tough last month when we handed out the RIF notices — but we are not wasting time
feeling sorry for ourselves. We are viewing this as an opportunity, a chance to redefine and restructure our
entire PD operation.

I want to give you a brief update on the progress we have made.

   •   We have developed a strategic plan (attached) which we have conveyed to Washington. Rather than
       just slicing off pieces of our PD operation, we have focused on our key goals and on how to focus our
       resources to get maximum impact in the areas that are most important.

   •   We are well advanced in creating a new organizational structure for PA Germany in line with our
       strategic plan.

   •   We are significantly reducing and reshaping our PD LES staffing. We began the process with close to
       60 PD LES throughout Germany. We will end up with 41.

   •   Now we are looking carefully at all the positions that remain and, wherever necessary, redefining them
       in line with the principles laid out in the strategic plan. Our objectives include: emphasis on new
       media, elimination of stove piping among the traditional PD elements (e.g. Press, Culture, Information
       Resource work), and creating the capacity to form issue-focused "campaign teams." These teams will
       closely integrate all areas of activity (Press, Culture, Information Services) and link staff resources
       Mission-wide.

Our goal is to create a 21st century PD operation that is lean, quick and flexible. We are well on our way to
achieving that goal. Assuming our new funding level remains stable, I am convinced that we will come out of
this stronger than ever.
