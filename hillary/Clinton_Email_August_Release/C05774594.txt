Dear Cheryl - -

My name is Kris Durmer, and I am the recently appointed (9/21/09) General Counsel of GSA. I am also from NH and a
long-time supporter and acquaintance of Secretary Clinton and the former President. Please convey my best wishes and
congratulations to the Secretary for the recent US-Russia nuclear agreement and her work generally over the last year.
She has been terrific!

My best,

Kris
