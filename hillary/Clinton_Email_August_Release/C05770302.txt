                                                                      RELEASE IN FULL



                 AF/PDPA 2010-2014 Organizational Development Plan

                                        Executive Summary

          To address concerns raised by the OIG in its August 2009 inspection report of the Africa
  Bureau, the Office of Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs (AF/PDPA) has engaged in an
  organizational development process. Over the past few months AF/PDPA has defined the
  philosophy, role, mission, audiences, core functions, and value added of public diplomacy and
  public affairs in the Africa Bureau and set goals and strategies for the AF/PDPA office to excel.

          The Department of State's expertise on public diplomacy programs and activities in
  Africa, on the regional African public and media context, and on the Department's engagement
  with the media and American audiences on African issues should reside in AF/PDPA.

          The mission of Africa Bureau (AF) public diplomacy and public affairs is to support the
  achievement of U.S. foreign policy goals and objectives, advance national interests, and enhance
  national security by understanding, engaging, informing and influencing the people of Africa and
  informing the people of the United States of America in order to create an enabling environment
  and strong relationships for a healthy, mutually-beneficial U.S.-African partnership.

          This four-year organizational development plan lays down specific goals, strategies and
  actions/changes that will facilitate the highest level of performance of the office's core functions,
  address the office's performance challenges, and take advantage of opportunities. Throughout
  this plan is an ongoing commitment by AF/PDPA personnel to a new approach to their work.
  The commitment is to increased initiative, more strategic thinking, more frequent and earlier
  engagement in policy-making processes, and a fuller understanding by every staff member of
  how his/her work contributes to the larger whole. Over the course of the next few months, the
  approach of each AF/PDPA staff member will change as will a number of roles and portfolios.
  This plan assumes that the rest of the AF Bureau not only will be receptive to these changes but
  also will pro-actively seek AF/PDPA expertise and collaboration as appropriate.

          The most visible outcome of this organizational development process will be the physical
  reorganization in the Africa Bureau. As soon as space is available, AF/PDPA will embed public
  diplomacy desk officers in the AF geographic offices. In order to make space available and to
  increase coordination among the bureau's functional offices, all of which do some engaging of
  civil society and private-sector audiences in the United States and in Africa, Assistant Secretary
  Carson has asked the bureau's executive office to conduct a full-bureau analysis of office space
  based on function, size and resource available. This analysis
  will inform the ultimate decisions as to who sits where.          "The U.S. must recognize the
                                                                     necessity of orchestrating
          However, the most significant outcome of this
  process will not be the shuffling of office space, but the         networks of public, private and
  results. The current AF/PDPA team is constantly short-             civic actors to address global
  staffed but at its core is an innovative, talented team of Civil   problems"

  media and building long-term relationships for the United                       -- Anne-Marie Slaughter

 States. With added expertise, further integration with the rest of the Bureau and a 21' century
 focus on networking, AF/PDPA will produce results: more effective public diplomacy in Africa
 and public affairs in the United States and better informed policy-making in Washington.

  III.      The conduct of public diplomacy in Africa and AF's public affairs in the U.S. is
