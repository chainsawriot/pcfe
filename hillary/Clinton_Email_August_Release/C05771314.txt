JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli aircraft struck targets in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip after Palestinian militants fired a
rocket from the territory into Israel, security officials and witnesses said. Early September 4, Gaza militants fired a
rocket into southern Israel, causing no injuries, the Israeli military said. Hours later, witnesses and Hamas security
officials said Israeli aircraft fired rockets at targets in Gaza, including smuggling tunnels along the border with Egypt. At
least two people were wounded, medical workers said.
