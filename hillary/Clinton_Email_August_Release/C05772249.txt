Kris-- can you follow up on these issues and let me know so we can report back? Thx.

  Steve Schwarzman at Blackstone wanted help on a visa for                              and said Mickey Kantor was        B3 INA
talking to Cheryl about it. What's status?
  David Cote of Honeywell wanted help w                                                                         He also      B4
complained about export control regs that intertere w sales. He said the State Dept is the holdup and gave example of
nuts and bolts for an engine being labelled as "dual use and therefore couldn't be exported. Andrew may know about
this.
