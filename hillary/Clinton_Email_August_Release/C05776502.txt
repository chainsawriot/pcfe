CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt's liberal Wafd party, which controls the second biggest opposition bloc in the outgoing
parliament, said on December 2 it had withdrawn backing for two seats won in the first round of elections which it said
was rigged. Wafd and the biggest opposition group, the Muslim Brotherhood, said they were quitting the election race
before run-offs next week after a vote on November 28 they said was marred by ballot box stuffing, thuggery and dirty
tricks.
