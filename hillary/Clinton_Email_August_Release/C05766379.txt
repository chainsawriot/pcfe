FYI — Bill did talk to Senator Specter. It went fine. Specter was glad to hear we had approached the Syrians re: the
hikers.

I talked to Sen Specter, and confirmed that we have approached Syrians (along with others) to ask their help on
hikers. He was appreciative.

Bill — the Secretary asked if you would be willing to call Specter back on her behalf....sorry to drag you into this. Jim
Steinberg tells me we have also just sent (or will send) a dip note to Syria and others in the region on this same subject.

For your review, I've attached Sen. Specter's letter to S about this issue. We just received this fax.

Sir,

Senator Specter just called for the Secretary to discuss the three Amcit hikers detained in Iran —Josh Fattal is a
constituent from Elkins Park, PA. Since S is on travel, he passed his message to me.

Specter wants to know what/if anything the Department has done to enlist the assistance of Syria in obtaining the
release of the Amcits detained in Iran. Specter said he recently spoke with the Syrian Ambassador to the U.S. lmad
Moustapha, who mentioned that Syria helped the UK when five Brits were detained in Iran.

Specter has our information in the office and has made it clear that he would like an answer later this morning. He can
be reached at 202-224-4254.

Sincerely,

Dan
