Gordon was convinced he had to sacrifice himself for any attempt to form a grand progressive coalition with the Lib-Dems.
Clegg had said during the campaign he would not deal with Gordon and he remained adamant. Peter, Alastair, Ed Balls,
and Ed Miliband met secretly with the LD team on Sunday. Gordon decided to fall on his sword today. The negotiations
between Labour and the LDs now are engaged with the same teams. The Tories at the same time also are negotiating.
Both offer competing plans for electoral reform that would give the LDs more representation in the future. If the LDs strike
a deal with the Tories Labour is unlikely to support it and campaign against that referendum. Cameron is strained right
now. His right does not approve of a deal while others push him to make an arrangement in order to attain power.
Cameron may be limited in how far he can go in his offer. But by no means is a Labour-LD deal certain or even probable,
even given Gordon's political suicide. The campaign for leader to replace Gordon begins as soon as the Labour-LD
negotiations are concluded. David is ready to go; he will face Ed Balls and possibly his brother Ed. If there is a coalition
that would tilt against Balls, who is seen as Gordon's heir and as an inappropriate PM, Gordon redux, to work with the
LDs. One of the Milibands will emerge. I still bet on David. So four days after the election, everything is still in play. Sid
