Subject: (Reuters) Russia's Putin warns West over missile defense

MOSCOW (Reuters) â€” Prime Minister Putin told CNN television that Russia will deploy nuclear weapons and "strike
forces" if it is shut out of a Western missile defense system, echoing a warning from President Medvedev. In an interview
with Larry King, Putin said missile threats against Europe must be tackled jointly -- a reference to an agreement reached
at a Russia-NATO summit this month to cooperate on missile defense. But if Russia's proposals are rejected and new
threats appear along its borders, "Russia will have to ensure its own security," Putin said. Russia would "put in place new
strike forces.. .against the new threats which will have been created along our borders," Putin said. "New missile, nuclear
technologies will be put in place." Putin said Russia does not want this to happen and is not threatening the West, but the
remarks underscored the Kremlin's insistence on a significant role in a missile defense system and suggested ties could
sour badly if agreement is not reached.
