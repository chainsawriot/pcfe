A media update, CNN just called for a comment after the British rejected the letter. I told CNN that we
provided the team/delegation the waiver letter earlier this afternoon. I quoted from it that the waiver, which
applied to 28 individuals, was a limited authorization for departure from and re-entry in the United States. I
made clear during the briefing that even though we granted the waiver they needed to gain visas from the UK.
So, there is a sad ending to the story, but I also made clear during the briefing that the unique situation that
they found themselves in stemmed from their decision not to apply for a U.S. passport. I'll keep you updated
on the media play.
