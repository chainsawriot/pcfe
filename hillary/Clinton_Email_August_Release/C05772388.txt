I will have with me a big file on this; I raised the case on the margins of Aboul-Gheit's meeting with you on August 30.
We will work with CA to have a letter prepared to take.

The case is typical in that the U.S. parent has custody that the Egyptian courts have not yet recognized (case is pending).
But it's atypical in that it's the mother who took the kids to Egypt and the father who is in the U.S. We're in touch with
Senator Kerry's office on this.

The Senator called to ask me to raise the Egyptian custody case of the mother absconding w her children from the US
using fake passports. He said he has reason to believe if I ask Mubarak directly, "you could bring the kids home w you."
Do you know about this?

I'd like to have a letter to Mubarak prepared outlining the facts that I could discuss and leave w him, assuming any of
this makes sense.

Pis advise.
