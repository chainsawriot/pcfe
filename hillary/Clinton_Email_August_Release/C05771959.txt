Subject: Iraq government formation


Depending of course on how the meeting goes today, we think it would be very good if the Secretary could attend the
VP meeting tomorrow to make sure that the hard questions about where we are on Iraq government formation are
addressed.


The Secretary uniquely brings the ability to express her instincts on where this process is going (or not going) and she
brings the understanding of the whole region that we must take into account as we push for an Iraqi government. Her
understanding of where we are on the Peace Process, our credibility with the full range of Arab leaders, and our
relationship with Iran, are subjects she can put on the table and make sure are comprehensively considered before any
decisions on a way forward are reached.
