TEHRAN (AP) - Iranian officials are acknowledging international sanctions imposed on the country over its nuclear
program have dramatically increased the cost of living, but the penalties will ultimately prove futile. Commerce Minister
Mahdi Ghazanfari said if the sanctions were really having an impact, then the UN would not have had to impose four
sets of penalties. Chamber of Commerce President Mohammad Nahavandian did say the sanctions have driven up the
cost of imports by 30 percent.
