  Re: Wikileaks


  The Wikileaks documents can be cast as reflecting a positive light on the U.S. government and
  diplomacy. Your statement about how the documents underscored the Iranian nuclear threat is
  headed in the right direction.

      1. The Wikileaks disclosure is the opposite of the Pentagon Papers. The Pentagon Papers
         provided evidence from an internal study conducted by the Department of Defense that
         the U.S. administration was not telling the truth about the Vietnam War. On the contrary,
         the Wikileaks papers prove that the U.S. government today has been telling the truth
         about the threats we face in the world. Our government is telling the truth.
      2. The Wikileaks papers prove that American diplomats are hard at work at the difficult,
         often frustrating job of protecting and advancing our interests in the world. These
         documents are testimony to the diligence, intelligence and clear mindedness of our
         diplomats. Our diplomats are doing their work on the frontlines of national security.
