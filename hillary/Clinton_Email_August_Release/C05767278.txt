Phillippe, Jim has just been in touch with PJ on this.

Jim sent Rogin three emails flat out denying the entire story but Rogin apparently chose to run it anyway. According to
Jim's correspondence with Rogin, there is no truth to this — he has not talked to anyone at Georgetown or the School of
Foreign Service or the search committee and has not expressed interest in the position.

Exclusive: Is State Dept. #2 Steinberg On His Way Out?

Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg is being considered for the job of dean of the Georgetown
School of Foreign Service, multiple sources close to the process told The Cable.

Steinberg, the number-two official at the State Department, is widely regarded as a top-tier academic and
most recently served as dean of the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, Austin, but has
faced some turbulence since landing in Foggy Bottom.

Reportedly disappointed after initially angling for a higher position, Steinberg has taken on a broad
portfolio at State, both as Secretary Hillary Clinton's deputy and focusing on Asia as his personal policy
domain. But some State Department bureaucrats privately gripe about what they see as Steinberg's
sometimes intrusive style, and some of his policy proposals have been seen as poorly coordinated with the
other parts of the policy community. "He's a brilliant guy, but just not a great fit for that job," said one
administration source.

According to two sources familiar with the process, Steinberg has met with the Georgetown search
committee and expressed an interest in applying for the job. The search committee has also met with
individuals close to Steinberg, to hear their recommendations for him. Sources said the search committee
is still narrowing the candidate list and conducting interviews, before making any recommendations to the
university president.

When asked if he was a candidate for the job by The Cable, Steinberg said by email, "It would be news to
me."

The leading contender, according to insiders, is the current acting Dean Carol Lancaster. A graduate of
the School of Foreign Service herself, Lancaster was once deputy administrator of USAID and is a tenured
professor there now. Other potential candidates, according to sources, include former Undersecretary of
State Nicholas Burns, Princeton University professor Tom Christensen, and former State Department
official Marc Grossman. Grossman told The Cable he was contacted about the job, but he is not a
candidate. The others did not respond to requests for comment.

"Carol has brilliantly checked boxes," said Robert Gallucci, the immediate past dean, who now heads the
MacArthur Foundation after stepping down from the School of Foreign Service after 13 years. Gallucci
worked with Lancaster on the State Department's policy planning staff under Anthony Lake, another
Georgetown professor.

Gallucci is not part of the search committee, but talked with The Cable about the process and what the
school might be looking for.

"It's a wonderful, challenging job with great opportunity to impact young people who will be in positions of
leadership in the international sphere," Gallucci said, adding, "Somebody who had success in the policy
world, more likely in government service, could bring something special to the shaping of these minds and
the atmosphere of this school."
