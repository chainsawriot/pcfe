The UK election, I think, reflects lingering fixation on Tony. They just can't get over him. The British public feels like the
wife he abandoned for George W. Bush, wants vengeance, yet still pines for him. Clegg is a Tony stand-in love object,
Cameron a pretender. Alas, poor Gordon, Heathcliffe, unloved, unlovable, suffering.

Next time you feel like stepping all over your story by saying you are tired,

use the line of the black woman in the Montgomery bus boycott who walked to

work: "My feet is tired, but my soul is rested."



On UK: Clegg held his own in the second debate last night. Gordon hit him as

"anti-American." This feels like it's moving to a hung parliament. Cameron can't

break through. Two-thirds of the voters simply hate the Tories. No matter how

well Clegg does the system doesn't allow for any gain in seats to match his

personal poll numbers. UK stunned by its first series of debates and the whole

campaign has atrophied in wonderment, little happening between the debates.

Final one next week, but guaranteed not to be conclusive, just a repetition,
