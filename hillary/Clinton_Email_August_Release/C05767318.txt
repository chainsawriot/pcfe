Subject:                         call w/ Carl Bildt tomorrow



w/o presuming on the content of the call, you might want to remember that Bildt wrote a very good op-ed after your
internet freedom speech suggesting U.S.-EU cooperation in that area; the Swedish ambassador came to see me last
week to follow up and to say that the Bildt would like to host a meeting in Stockholm on the subject that Alec would
presumably go to. If you need a sweetener of any kind, emphasizing our enthusiasm for following up on this would be
good. AM
