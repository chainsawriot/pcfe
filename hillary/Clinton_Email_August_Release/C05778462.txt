Sen. Ron Wyden Has Early Stage Prostate Cancer, Will Miss Votes

Posted Thursday, December 16, 2010 5:06 PM I By David Weigel

Here is the statement -- Wyden caught the cancer early, but will have to miss votes tomorrow and
next week.

       After my annual physical in late November, I was diagnosed with early stage prostate cancer. After reviewing all
       the options with multiple physicians, I decided to take a proactive approach and have surgery, which will be
       performed December 20 at Johns Hopkins Hospital by Dr. Alan Partin.

       Thanks to routine screening, this was diagnosed very early and I expect a full and speedy recovery.

       I scheduled the surgery for the Monday before Christmas anticipating that the Senate would have recessed by
       that time and that there would be no disruption to my work in Oregon or Washington. However, it now appears
       that I will be missing votes tomorrow and possibly next week while I prepare and undergo this procedure. I
       expect to be back to work full-time when the Senate reconvenes in January.

       If anything is taken away from my experience, I hope it is the importance of getting routine physicals. One in six
       men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetimes. Early detection is critical to catching this
       disease when treatment is most effective.

Wyden's vote is one Democrats are counting on for tough votes; he's needed to pass the START treaty, the omnibus, and
possibly the DREAM Act. According to current vote counts, it would be possible for the Senate to repeal DADT without
Wyden's vote -- with the support of key Republicans, vote counters say they're at 61 or 62.
