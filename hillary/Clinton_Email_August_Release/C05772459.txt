Subject: (Reuters) EU to call on Israel to extend settlement halt

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders meeting in Brussels on September 16 will call on Israel to extend a
moratorium on settlement building in the occupied West Bank, according to a draft of the summit conclusions. "The
European Union deems it indispensable that both parties observe calm and restraint and refrain from actions that could
affect negatively the progress of the negotiation," reads the draft, referring to direct Israeli-Palestinian peace talks that
began this month. "In this regard, it recalls that settlements are illegal under international law and, with a view to
ensure that these talks continue in a constructive manner, calls for an extension of the moratorium decided by Israel."
