                                                                         Paris, January 19, 2010


                                             COMMUNIQUÃ‰


      During their telephone conversation last week, the President of the Republic and President
      Obama expressed the resolute commitment of our two countries in Haiti, and decided to
      combine their efforts in order to deal with the urgent humanitarian situation and to respond, in
      the future, to the enormous reconstruction requirements.

      The French authorities have, since then, been entirely satisfied with the cooperation between
      our two countries and, beyond that, the continuous coordination between the Crises Centers of
      the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs and the U.S. Department of State. They want to
      pay tribute to the United States' extraordinary mobilization efforts in support of Haiti and the
      vital role it is playing on the ground.
