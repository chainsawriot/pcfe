Subject: (Reuters) Israel said to reject Palestinian formula for talks

JERUSALEM (Reuters) â€” Israel has rejected a Palestinian proposal to begin face-to-face peace talks on the basis of a
statement by major powers that would set their terms of reference. Reports in the left-wing dailies Haaretz and Maariv
said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told U.S. envoy George Mitchell that he wants direct talks to start immediately
but will not accept any preconditions. Netanyahu spokesman Mark Regev had no direct comment on the reports, which
said Mitchell's mission had "failed." Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas refuses to engage in direct talks before
Netanyahu agrees to a clear agenda.
