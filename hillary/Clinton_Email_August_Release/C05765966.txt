This is probably entirely inappropriate, but I had gathered that you were thinking possibly of taking
off on Dec 21. I would urge you to — for your own sake. The pace is absolutely killing and you
deserve it. But it will also mean that a lot of folks who would like to take some time off with their
family before Xmas (e.g. moms like me who are necessary to make Xmas happen) would feel much
freer to do so. AM
