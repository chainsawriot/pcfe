Subject: Palau Agreement!

Signed by Pres. Toribiong a couple of hours ago after three days of negotiations that I conducted for Palau and DAS
Frankie Reed led for the US. These were the first real negotiations of the process -- a step (which Jake Sullivan helped
get taken) that was as needed as the changes in the US proposal they produced. Thanks for all that you did. It obtained
US objectives as well as resulted in substantially greater fairness for a former territory, now freely associated state. Jeff

conveyed their complaints to him and others to make sure their views are understood. The remaining issues are small --
but significant to them. And the FSOs who've been negative since the Bush Admin. are not the best messengers. I've
advised dialogue at a political level. But this is just FYI.
