Hillary Clinton gave a speech at the American Task Force on Palestine on October 20th. Her speech was the
best speech that any US Secretary of State has given on the Palestine question. What made her speech different
was her emphasis on two concepts that resonate with Arabs and Moslems mirroring justice and dignity. Her
speech was well received and several Arab commentators wrote positively about what she said.
