Subject: Another Rescue--22 year old man by Israeli SAR

From Ha'aretz (NYT also reporting this, but quote about American and French teams failing is of concern):

An Israel Defense Forces search and rescue team extricated a 22-year-old Haitian man on Friday from the
rubble of a three-story building which collapsed as a result of last week's devastating earthquake.

The man was being treated at an lDF field hospital and is currently in stable condition.

Local residents directed the IDF crew to the trapped victim, the lDF said.
"American and French doctors were unable to rescue the trapped man and called upon the Israeli Advertisement
delegation's search and rescue teams who rescued the man within half an hour, from a tunnel,
2.5-3-meters long and were able to release him whole and healthy," said Maj. Zohar Moshe, a member of the
rescue team.
