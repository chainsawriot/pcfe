Subject                             Fw: "Do More"



Fyi - see below. i discussed with Larry. This is not about anything specific you've said, it's the PakMil's general rejoinder to
the American message. But it is worth keeping this critique in mind.

Subject: "Do More"

The expression "do more" repeated incessantly in today's press is essentially a negative characterization of the
Secretary's position. In general, it is code for "After so much cost and so many losses and so many bombs in our cities,
the Americans are telling us we're still not doing enough." This negative interpretation is used by the PakMil to convince
Pakistanis that the U.S. is a malign influence and to avoid taking the steps we seek.

When you brief her this morning suggest the following:

          We avoid literally using the words "do more;" but
          Do not hesitate to specify what we want them to do; and
          Let's push back on this view: We acknowledge their contributions and their losses — and we are helping. We-
          would never ask Pakistan to do more alone —we are doing more, too, including supporting Pakistan militarily
          and economically. Freedom requires constant vigilance and democracy is never "done."
