TEHRAN (Reuters) - Iran has accepted a date for talks with major powers, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said. The
six powers hope the talks -- for which a date of December 5 was previously mooted -- will focus on its disputed nuclear
program, but Tehran has said its uranium enrichment activity will not be up for negotiation. "Two dates have been
proposed, they accepted one of them and we do not have any problem with that," Ahmadinejad told a news
conference, adding that the venue was still under discussion.
