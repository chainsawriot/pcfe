Shaun just called (7 pm EST) to report 100 percent unanimous support in DUP for Peter Robinson's recommendation to
complete devolution. The deal will be agreed with the two PMs at Hillsborough tomorrow morning, 8:15 am (London
time). If you wish you may call Shaun. You can reach him through No. 10 Downing St switchboard. Gordon will mention
your role tomorrow at the event. Hooray! Sid
