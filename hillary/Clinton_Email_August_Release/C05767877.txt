Subject: Trip Postponement

Huma, I wanted to relay to you the sincere sentiments of appreciation expressed by the PM's Office and the MFA for the
very personal touch by the Secretary notifying the PM about postponement of the trip. Not lost on the GPNG is the fact
that the entire trip was postponed, not the PNG portion. As you can imagine that is politically very significant.

Naturally, we stand ready to reconstitute the program or enhance it should the trip move forward at a later date. We
got luck today w/the weatherâ€”not a rain cloud in sight.

Safe travels, and hopefully we will work together at a later date. Best of luck with the Haiti recovery effort!
Regards,


Teddy B. Taylor
