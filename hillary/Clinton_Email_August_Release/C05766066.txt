Hi Cheryl:

Today, I was able to have good preliminary conversations with Jean Bonilla and Lorraine Hariton in EEB. Both Jean and
Lorraine are very excited about the opportunity to partner on this new area for the Secretary and provided me with
some very valuable insight and discussion on how we can partner and collaborate on programming and initiatives
together.

I also included the information from ECA —that we discussed in the document. The INR meeting was cancelled today and
will be scheduled for early next week. As I move around the Department and talk with other officials in the coming
week, I believe we will be able to build out a more robust Work Plan and garner some great collaborations on this
effort.

Additionally, in a recent conversation that I had with Governor O'Malley from Maryland, I shared with him that the
Secretary was launching a new effort that would assist state and local leaders with respect to their global affairs
portfolios. The Governor was extremely excited and remarked that he has some great idea for the Secretary about how
the Department can be a major value-add to local governments. He told me that he wants to be very engaged in what
we do in the Department in this area. I will be scheduling a time to meet with him and his economic team once my
position has been announced. He wanted me to let her know that he had been thinking about her and wanted to reach
out and did not know how and then I walked in and we began to have this discussion and he said — what a way to start
his year for 2010 — something coming to reality that he had been thinking about.

Also, Maura Pally in ECA forwarded me a meeting that I took with the Deputy Director of the National Lieutenant
Governor's Association. They were in town working on their upcoming Washington meeting. They too are very excited
about what we are planning and want to work very closely with us in the coming months as we launch this effort. Lt.
Governor Bill Bolling in VA is the current Chair.
