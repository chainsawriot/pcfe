   Re: Shaun, NI

1. Not only is Shaun eager to come to the NI conference but Ed Miliband also very much would like him to attend. Should
   Shaun contact Jake or DecIan, or should they contact him? Ed M. would like Shaun to establish the channel to you and
   also through me. If you have time the three of us might meet to discuss current UK politics and policies.
2. Joe Wilson is in Washington next week for the special advance showing of the movie, "Fair Game," (starring Sean Penn
   as Joe, Naomi Watts as Valerie). He wants to know if you want to attend one of the showings or whether he can arrange
   for a special private showing for you.
