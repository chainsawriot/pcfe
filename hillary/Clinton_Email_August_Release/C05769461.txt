The Settlement Freeze That Never Was, And Never Will Be

Linda Forsell's June 21 photos of ongoing construction in the Israeli settlement of Har Homa expose the illusion of
Netanyahu's settlement freeze
With the Israeli settlement moratorium scheduled to expire on September 26, the right-wing parties in Israel's coalition
government are exerting maximum pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to block the policy's renewal. "Let's
get rid of the freeze and get back to building," declared Israeli Minister of Public Affairs and the Diaspora Yuli Edelstein on
Israel National Radio yesterday. "It's our land anyway!" (Edelstein lives in the settlement of Neve Daniel).
Back in the US, the former Israel lobbyist and ex-Clinton Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk took to the Washington
Post's op-ed page to praise Netanyahu and Barack Obama for ensuring that "there were zero building starts in the West
Bank settlements."
During the week of June 21, I traveled through the West Bank with Swedish photojournalist Linda Forsell to document
new settlement construction and the settlers' theft of water from Palestinian towns. Forsell took a series of photos at Har
Homa, a massive Israeli settlement towering over the Palestinian town of Beit Sarhour. Her photos show ongoing
construction of hundreds of new settlement units â€” documents of the settlement freeze sham.

announced the freeze in November 2009. He attempted to disguise new settlement construction by drawing a false
distinction between the West Bank and "parts of Jerusalem" like Har Homa that actually lie outside 1967 lines. As Israeli
government flack Mark Regev remarked in December 2009, "We've made a clear distinction between the West Bank and
Jerusalem. Jerusalem is our capital and will stay as such." With a few exceptions, Obama allowed this scheme to go
forward.
According to the Washington Post, Obama's meeting with Netanyahu this week will have more to do with reassuring
Jewish Democrats than with halting the wholesale colonization of the West Bank. As the Post's Anne Kornblut reported,
"The White House meeting will not dwell on some of the most difficult time-sensitive issues, including the expiration of a

moratorium on Israeli settlement construction in September." This may mean an end to the settlement freeze, but it was
only an illusion after all.
