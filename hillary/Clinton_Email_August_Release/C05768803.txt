On the speech it mieht be 15 but not much more. Dan K-P has taken over drafting                                                    B6
             He has been incorporating fine-tuning edits today. I will email you a draft shortly, which will be tweaked
in the am.                                          Unfortunately, there is no teleprompter at the UN.                             B5

On your book, I understand that Huma will bring it out in the morning.

Also, I just saw on the schedule I was expected to speak for only 12 minutes. I think the speech as written is longer but I
haven't seen the final draft. Is there a teleprompter?

I also don't yet have any briefing materials. Will I get them tonight or tomorrow morning?
