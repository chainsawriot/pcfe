Huma, below is a proposed statement on Jones & Donilon.
Dan



General Jim Jones has spent a lifetime serving our country with honor and distinction. In war and in peace, from foreign
battlefields to the highest levels of our government, he has exemplified the best traditions of the Marine Corps and the
United States. I have been honored to serve with him and to call him my friend. As National Security Advisor he brought
a steady hand and clear vision to an unforgiving agenda. His leadership was crucial in winding down the combat mission
in Iraq, refocusing the war in Afghanistan, and advancing our nation's interests and values around the world. America is
more secure and the world is more stable because of Jim's tireless efforts. He will be sorely missed, but I am pleased
that Jim will now be able to spend more time with his wife Diane and their wonderful family.

General Jones leaves Marine-sized shoes to fill, but we are fortunate that a public servant as talented and dedicated as
Tom Donilon has agreed to take on the task. I have known Tom for many years and he brings deep experience and
valuable skills to this crucial job. He has a proven ability to translate big-picture vision into concrete action. As Deputy
National Security Advisor, Tom has been a trusted member of our team and has contributed to every major policy
decision. I appreciate his support for the State Department and our diplomacy and development efforts around the
world and I look forward to working closely with him to implement the President's agenda.
