Newt Gingrich: Hillary Clinton 'Terrific' Defense
Secretary
If President Obama decides to move Hillary Clinton to the Pentagon as part of a mid-term shake-up, he can
count on some unlikely support -- from Newt Gingrich.

"She is knowledgeable, she is tough, I think that she'd be a very aggressive defender of the military in terms of
what it needs, its budgets and its concerns," Gingrich told me.

The Washington rumor mill has been talking about Clinton moving over to the Pentagon for some time -- but
the secretary of state told my colleague Cynthia McFadden that she has "made it clear that I love the job I
have."

The former speaker of the House said he was impressed with Clinton when they served together on the
Transformation Advisory Group for the Joint Forces Command.

"If she would take it she would be terrific," he told me.

"I'm not sure she would have quite as much fun," Gingrich added. "I think she probably would have an even
better time being secretary of state."
