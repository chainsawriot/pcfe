   Subject: Update on your trip to Doha

   Judith,

   Below is a rough outline of your trip to Doha, as it currently stands.

   LOGISTICS:

   You are currently scheduled to arrive in Doha on May 1 at 6:30 and depart May 2 at 7 pm. Traveling with you
   will be Kitty DiMartino, Joe Mellott, Mark Davidson, and GSEC's LTC Eric Schoennauer. Dana Smith will fly
   in from the Media Hub in Dubai to meet you in Doha.

   KEY EVENTS:

   Dinner with Al Jazeera (AJ) staff: AJ Director General Wadah Khanfar will host a dinner on May 1 with
   senior AJ staff, including AJ English Managing Director Tony Burman. We expect 7 people on the AJ side and
   6 on ours. (The dinner is schedule for 8pm in a private room in the Four Seasons; post is making reservations
   for the party to stay in the same hotel.)

   Meeting with AJ Board Members at AJ Headquarters: This will give you an opportunity to engage the
   Qatari leadership of the network. Discussions topics should include the mid-May Washington visit by some AJ
   Board representatives. We expect Wadah Khanfar to also participate in this meeting.

   (TBC) Meeting with Prime Minister Hamad bin Jasim bin Jabir al-Thani (HBJ): As PM, HBJ is the
   ultimate Qatari authority on AJ. The meeting will also allow you to raise bi-lateral engagement issues as
   necessary. We expect to know in a few days if HBJ will be available.

   Meetings with CENTCOM: You will meet with CENTCOM staff at Al Udeid airbase just outside of
   Doha. They will brief you on their                         within their AOR, but with particular B1
   focus on activities ir                                                                           1.4(D)

Feature on AJ Arabic: 15 minute "feature" piece filmed at AJ Studios on the Administration's commitment to
engagement with Muslim communities worldwide. This will be a good opportunity to highlight the
Entrepreneurship Summit. We can expect you to also get questions on PD programs in Afghanistan, Pakistan,
and Iraq. You will be interviewed by one of AJ's "top" journalists; exactly who is still to be determined. The
interview will be in English with simultaneous interpretation into Arabic. It will likely air a number of times on
AJ.

Feature on AJ English: This would be a second 15 minute "feature" piece similar to the one for AJ Arabic. If
we are pressed for time we can consider just doing the AJ Arabic feature.

Roundtable with local Qatari media: This will include journalists from a number of local Qatari media
outlets. This is another opportunity to talk about the Administration's commitment to engagement, but with a
more targeted focus on bilateral engagement and exchange programs.

Note — Wadah Khanfar has been closely engaged on, if not driving, the portions of your program that deal with
AJ. Post reports that he is very pleased to have this opportunity for you to engage with AJ leadership in Doha.

Best,
Ann
