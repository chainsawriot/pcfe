FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 22, 2010

                        GLICKMAN STEPPING DOWN FROM MPAA.
              Will become President of Refugees International in April; Pisano named as Interim CEO
Washington, D.C. — Dan Glickman, Chairman and CEO of the Motion Picture Association of America, Inc. (MPAA) today
announced that he will be leaving the MPAA beginning April 1, to become President of Refugees International, the leading
advocacy organization on refugee crises worldwide. Bob Pisano, President and Chief Operating Officer at the MPAA since
2005, will become interim CEO, while the search continues for Glickman's replacement.

"In making this announcement, I want to thank Barry Meyer, Jim Gianopulos, Brad Grey, Bob Ig-er, Michael Lynton, Ron
Meyer, and the entire MPAA. Board of Directors, for their guidance and leadership. It has been an honor to have worked so
closely with them. I also want to thank Bob Pismo and all the MPAA staff for their dedication during a time of major
transition in our business," Glickman said. "As I look forward to returning to public service and joining Refugees
International, I am proud to look back at what the MPAA has accomplished since I took this job in 2004. We have fought
vigorously on behalf of the 2.4 million Americans and other workers throughout the world whose jobs are based on a vibrant
film and television business. This is a powerful medium that can help make a difference, and I will always value my time
here. For me, perhaps the best thing about the job was the movies. I love movies. And as far as I am concerned, we make
the best movies in the world."

Barry M. Meyer, Chairman and CEO, Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., praised Glickman's leadership. 'Dan has
demonstrated great leadership in his role as Chairman of the MPAA. He has guided the organization during a time of historic
changes and unprecedented challenges throughout the entertainment industry," said Mr. Meyer. `We thank Dan for his
tireless support of the issues facing our businesses, particularly in protecting intellectual property rights in the United States
and around the world. We wish him every success in his new position."

Mr. Meyer continued: "We would also like to express our gratitude to Bob for agreeing to be interim Chairman and have
every confidence in his abilities to continue the crucial work of the MPAA."

"Throughout his tenure at the MPAA, Dan served as an incredibly skillful and dedicated advocate for the issues that are most
important to the film and television industries — global market access, copyright protection and ensuring an overall healthy
future for our collective businesses," said Jim Gianopulos, Chairman and CEO of Fox Filmed Entertainment. "Furthermore,
we look forward to working with Bob and are grateful that he's agreed to serve as interim CEO over the near term."

"Our industry has been well served by Dan's efforts and advocacy worldwide and we appreciate the job he has done on our
behalf. He is a great humanitarian and will be very effective in his new role," said Bob Iger, president and CEO, The Walt
Disney Company.

Glickman, who has held the top position at the MPAA since 2004, had previously announced that he would not be seeking a
renewal of his contract beyond September 2010 and has been working with the MPAA board during its search process for a
new chief.

Glickman presided over the MPAA during a period of unprecedented transition in the film and television industry. The rise of
digital technology has presented both challenges in the form of massive copyright theft and innovative opportunities for
filmmakers to share their work around the world.

Through his leadership, Glickman helped raise awareness of the economic consequences of copyright theft. He also worked
with a broad labor and business coalition to secure passage of the Pro-IP Act, which increased resources and enforcement to
protect intellectual prooerty. And he has vigorously promoted a myriad of legitimate ways for consumers to view movies and
TV shows on the Internet.

Glickman also helped lead the effort to win passage of legislation banning camcording in movie theaters throughout the
United States and around the world. And he worked to modernize the movie rating system, increasing its transparency and
launching a free weekly Red Carpet Ratings email service that makes this resource more accessible to parents.

Bob Pisano has served as President and Chief Operating Officer of the Motion Picture Association of America, Inc. (MPAA)
since October 2005 and brings to the MPAA a wealth of diversified experience in business and legal practice. Pisano is
responsible for all day-zo-day worldwide operations of the motion picture and television industry trade association, and a
member of the Board of Directors.

Prior to joining the MPAA, he was National Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer of the Screen Actors
Guild. Before his tenure with the Screen Actors Guild, Pisano served for six years at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) where
he was first appointed :Executive Vice President and then Vice Chairman and a member of the studio's Board of
Directors. Prior to that, he served as Executive Vice President and General Counsel and Member of the Office of the
Chairman of Paramount Pictures.
