Subject:                         framework for Sarajevo town hall



Madam Secretary,

I'm writing remarks for your town hall in Sarajevo on Tuesday. Jake and Josh discussed having the
speechwriters send you bullets summarizing significant remarks ahead of time, so you can know the direction
we're taking and let us know if we're on the right or wrong track.

Below are the main points for Sarajevo; the draft I'm writing is covering this ground. It will follow the flow of
many of your previous town hall appearances.

If there is anything you'd like me to emphasize, add, or subject, let me know and I'll go for it.

Thanks very much,
Megan
