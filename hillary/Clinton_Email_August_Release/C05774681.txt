Recommend she do it. In fact we had arranged for a meeting in March but Ms. Boyner's trip was cancelled. We can send
up a new meeting request.

Dear Cheryl:




I have been asked by the Turkish Embassy, who I represent, to request a meeting with Secretary Clinton for Mrs. Umit
Boyner, a prominent Turkish business woman. Such a meeting could be whenever and wherever you determine most
convenient for the Secretary -- either in Washington, DC or Turkey.




As you will see from the biographical information below, Mrs. Boyner has had a distinguished career as a
businesswoman, and she has also devoted time to philanthropy as well. Mrs. Boyner was recently selected to be the
chair person of the board of one of the most prominent Turkish business organizations, the Turkish Industrialists' and
Businessmen's Association (TUSIAD) — an organization comparable to the Business Roundtable. I have also attached a
document providing additional background information on TUSIAD.




Mrs. Umit is a great admirer of Secretary Clinton's and would be extremely honored to be able to meet with her. I know
the Secretary is extremely busy, but I hope she can find a window to meet with Mrs. Umit. Thanks for all you help and
my personal regards to Secretary Clinton.




Best;




Dick
