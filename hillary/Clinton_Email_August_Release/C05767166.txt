I AM SO GLAD. If you get a chance remind Sheikha Mosa of me as I am wanting her to support my woman's foundation
so every little reminder helps!

Thanks for your concern.                                                             I'm on the way to Qatar and Saudi
Arabia. I will see the Sheikha in Doha and learn more about her work. I hope to see you soon for a catchup visit. All the
best.
