Subject: Passing of Dr. Peter Andrew Kraemer

The Office of the Historian is saddened to announce the premature passing of Dr. Peter Andrew Kraemer on
April 7, 2010

Dr. Kraemer joined the office in August 2004 as a historian producing volumes in the Foreign Relations of the
United States series, the official documentary history of U.S. foreign policy. He worked on volumes on South
Asia, Eastern Europe, and national security policy. He regularly lectured in the Foreign Service Institute's A-
100 orientation course for Foreign Service Officers. In November 2009, he made a video appearance on the
Department's DipNote blog, where he spoke about the rise and fall of the Berlin Wall. In January 2009, he
participated in an on-the-ground lessons learned project in Iraq, conducting oral history interviews on the nature
of civil-military cooperation.

In addition to his work at the Office of the Historian, Dr. Kraemer was a Professorial Lecturer in History at The
George Washington University, where he taught a course on the political, social, and cultural techniques that
create historical narratives. In years past, he taught History and American Studies at Indiana University and
Indiana University-Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin; served as an editorial assistant at the Journal of American
History; and worked as an oral historian at Indiana University's Oral History Research Center and the U.S.
Holocaust Memorial Museum. He was an active member of a number of professional organizations, including
the American Historian Association, the Organization of American Historians, the Society for Historians of
American Foreign Relations, and the Society for History in the Federal Government.
Dr. Kraemer completed his Ph.D. in History and American Studies at Indiana University in 2004, where he
wrote a dissertation entitled, "Germany is Whose Problem?: American Philanthropy and the German Question,
1944-1964." He took his M.A. in History from Indiana University and his B.A. in History and German at
Dickinson College.

For condolences and information on memorial services and donations, please contact Forrest Barnum at the
