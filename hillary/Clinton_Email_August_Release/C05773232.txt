Dear Counselor Mills:

Please convey to the Secretary my most profound thanks for her contribution to the 'It Gets Better' video series.
                                                                                             appreciated deeply her
actions on behalf of the LGBT community within the Department and USAID, and this latest statement--that gay youth
can count the Secretary of State among their supporters-- is a moving and powerful message for our country.

Again, my thanks,

Kevin McGlothlin
Team Lead, Economic Growth and Environment USAID/Mexico
