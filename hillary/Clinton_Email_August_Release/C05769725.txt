                  Western Europe: Publics Credit U.S. for Relief to Haiti

                  than other countries to assist Haiti following the devastating January earthquake.
                  Though relief efforts in Haiti have not themselves directly impacted opinion of the
                  United States, the belief that the United States generally assists disaster-stricken
                  countries does positively affect US. image.

                  (92%), Germans (85%), Italians (85%), and                        relief. In France, where early editorials were

                  Though certain West European media,                              majorities believe that the United States has
