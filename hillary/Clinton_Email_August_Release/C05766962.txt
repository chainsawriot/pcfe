Cheryl:


Thank you very much for your note. I am enormously grateful for the tremendous support that you and the Secretary
offered me during this confirmation gauntlet. Without that support I have no doubt that I would still be stuck in
confirmation limbo.

I am now looking forward to getting to Brasilia and getting to work.

I hope you and your family had a great Christmas. I am wishing you a happy and prosperous new year.

Tom
