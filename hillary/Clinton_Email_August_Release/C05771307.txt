This is the custody case Dean emailed you about and John Kerry called me to discuss. I personally gave a letter to
Mubarak and asked that the children be returned to their father in the US, or, at the least, be given court ordered visits.
I don't know what, if anything, then happened.

I'm copying Jeff Feltman on this and asking him to have someone follow up w Dean and Kerry and to let us both know
what's happening.

Thx, Jeff and let me know if there is anything more I need to do. HRC

Apparently Secretary Clinton got Mubarak's agreement to release the boys. The father is headed to Cairo on Monday to
pick them up at the embassy. Staff at the embassy and at the State Dept is now saying that this is only a visitation. As
you can imagine the family is really upset and the supporters are livid. They are expecting that Colin will be headed back
to the states with the boys Tuesday. The press wants to know what is going on. Any advice here, because I have no idea
what is going on? Many thanks to you and esp to Hillary for getting us this far. Howard
