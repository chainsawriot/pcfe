It's true you've got to consider the source...

Not a surprising assessment from Embassy.

This is from the political officer in London:

David Cameron will be given the right of reply after the PM's statement this afternoon -- followed by Q&A. UUP MP
Sylvia Hermon is likely to be "unhelpful" during the Q&A.

The Conservatives are becoming exasperated by the rumors that appear in the press and elsewhere that they are
unsupportive of the agreement. Our contacts say the Tories have been completely consistent in supporting the
government on devolution, though they don't believe HMG handled the issue well (i.e. allowing the exclusion of the UUP
and SDLP).

Reg Empey is scheduled to meet his MLAs tonight to review the document and prepare for the working group with
SDLP's Margaret Ritchie.
