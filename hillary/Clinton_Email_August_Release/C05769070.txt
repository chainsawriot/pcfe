Robert,




Are you sure that the USA Pavilion would not be in a sponsorship by Wynn Resorts (specifically Wynn Macau)? There
CFO, Matt Maddox, has expressed strong interest.




The Wynn Macau well known brand in China and Steve Wynn is an extremely popular figure in China. In addition, he is
well respected and well though of by the Chinese leadership and business leaders. A sponsorship by Wynn would be
well received.




I should be able to get an answer by early next week, but don't want to look foolish if they would be rejected.
