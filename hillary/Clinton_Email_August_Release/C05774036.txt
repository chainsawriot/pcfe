Erekat: PA has no plans to request UN recognition of state
By JPOST.COM STAFF
Chief Palestinian negotiator denies reports that he said PA would request the UN Security Council unilaterally recognize
Palestinian state along 1967 borders, says PA will instead demand criticism of settlements.

Chief Palestinian Negotiator Saeb Erekat on Wednesday denied saying that the Palestinian Authority plans to request that
the United Nations Security Council unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state along 1967 borders, Israel Radio reported.

Erekat said that the Palestinians have no intention of presenting such a proposal in the near future and that the earlier
report by Palestinian news agency Ma'an was erroneous.

He explained that the PA plans on demanding that the UN Security Council criticize settlement building in the West Bank.

According to the earlier report, Erekat had said that the PA plan to present a proposal to the UN Security Council on the
unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state. He was also quoted as expressing hope that the US would not attempt to act
against the PA's attempts and also called for South Korea, Japan, New Zealand and Australia to unilaterally recognize a
Palestinian state.

The PA negotiator was speaking at a meeting of Palestinian security officials in the town of Jericho.

Erekat had added that PA President Mahmoud Abbas contacted international and Hamas officials in an effort to prevent
an Israeli attack on the Gaza Strip.

After Erekat denied the report, a senior official told Israel Radio that the negotiator's remarks prove that the Palestinians
are not interested in negotiations but are interested in forcing solutions.

The official said that the US will operate covertly to eliminate settlement criticism from the UN Security Council's agenda.
If they do not succeed, it may be possible to veto the proposal or to present a counter-proposal, the official added.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said the Palestinian efforts do little to promote peace.

"By choosing unilateralism over direct talks, the Palestinians are declaring that they renounce peace altogether," he said.
"The Palestinians are choosing not to renew negotiations and are doing all they can to score minor points. They are trying
everything except to talk."

Erekat: PA to ask UN to recognize state soon

Chief negotiator says Palestinians will submit request as soon as Bosnia take over Security
Council presidency. 'Israeli government is witnessing an international isolation that it hasn't
witnessed before,' he says

The Palestinians will ask the United Nations Security Council to unilaterally recognize an independent Palestinian
state within the 1967 borders early next month, chief negotiator Saeb Erekat was quoted as saying by the Maan
News Agency Wednesday.

Speaking to reporters in the West Bank town of Jericho, Erekat said the Palestinians are waiting for Bosnia to take
the presidency of the Security Council before submitting the proposal.

"The Israeli government is witnessing an international isolation that it hasn't witnessed before," Erekat added. "And
this is due to the efforts exerted by the Palestinian leadership and by President Mahmoud Abbas."

According to the report, Erekat expressed hope that the US would not veto the proposal, and also called for South
Korea, Japan, New Zealand and Australia to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state.

Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador and Bolivia have all recognized a Palestinian stare over the past few weeks.

The Palestinians have recently announced their plan to introduce a draft resolution at the UN Security Council
condemning Jewish settlements in the West Bank.

On Friday the London-based Arabic daily Al Hayat quoted Erekat as saying "the negotiations (with Israel) are over.
Now is the time for decisions, not negotiations."
