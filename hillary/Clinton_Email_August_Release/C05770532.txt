Just spoke to Doug Frantz. A little intel (or not).

As you know, Menendez is driving the train on the June 29th hearing. He will chair. Lautenberg has requested the
opportunity to ask questions from the dais, but right now the Committee is pushing back saying they don't want this to
devolve into a circus.

Committee may ask State and/or DOJ to produce witness/es who can speak to the agreements entered into that
permitted Megrahi to be prosecuted and jailed in Scotland in the first place. From State, they're not sure if that's
someone from EUR, NEA, or elsewhere within the Department. This would be at the Committee's insistence and not
necessarily Menendez's.

I asked who they think Menendez might want to call as a witness. They said Tony Blair. I laughed. They didn't. Am told
the Committee is discouraging Menendez from even making the request. We'll see.
