Dear Cheryl -
He's going to call your             lumber. We're both hoping, on one had, that you're not there and you're at home.
Please feel free to call his cell phone              -- or he'll call you again on Monday. In the meantime, he asked me
to pass along to you this simple but heartfelt comment: "Please tell her I've never been prouder of my government. I
mean that. Sincerely."

Cindy
