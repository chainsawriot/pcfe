Subject:                        thank you



Madam Secretary -

I just wanted to drop you a quick note to thank you again for the great opportunity to be part of
your team over the last twenty months. I can't tell you how much I appreciate it - and how much of
a pleasure it's been to watch you work when I've had the chance.      .

I will definitely stay involved in the Middle East stuff while I'm in the private sector. And - as I
know you know - I hope I have the chance to do more for you down the road.

Please know that you can count on me for anything you need.

Best.

Jonath an
