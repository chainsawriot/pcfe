MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia called on the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
on December 30 to stop "muscle flexing" and begin dialogue, and backed China's call for an emergency
meeting of the six powers seeking to resolve tensions on the peninsula. "It is imperative to stop military activity
... and move from muscle flexing to dialogue between the North and South," Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
