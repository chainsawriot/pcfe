Hooray. 30th looks great (have to go to Edie's on the 29th for Gillibrand, but I can meet you after if that's better).

My other updates are:

With Gina, I'm hosting one of several dinner parties to welcome the new SEIU prez (yes a bit of an unstated message) to
women leaders. I think Wendy S and Judy L are doing the others. It's another of Gina's great ideas.

And we're holding a fundraiser for Bennet on the 27th that is looking really good.




Finally, I did a brief intv with a Center for Public Service rep for their regular feature in the Post abt compelling leaders in
the federal govnt. And this one will be about Kate Beale!
Oh, and after confirming to do so with PIR, did a quickie recalling the thoroughly positive vibes and experiences of you
and Laura Bush to our pal at Politico!!

Finally, finally, and hope I didn't say this already, I started yesterday am sending an anniversary greeting and ode to
Team 9-11 Clinton to everyone there when we waited for you to come in (for the Mrs. Bush testimony coincidentally)

and watched the 2nd plane, and of course the rest was our amazing journey together of work to be so proud of. I even
included Ramon on the chain!!!                                              Impossible it now seems.

Done blabbing. Have a restful Sunday. Everyone, and I mean everyone despite what I recall about some, is singing your
praises.

I'm all updated now! So, I will offer up some dates and you will pick the place for a catchup dinner--sounds like a deal!

I'm looking at 9/29 or 9/30. Do either of those work for you?
