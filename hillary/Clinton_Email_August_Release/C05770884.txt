FW: Just talked to yet ANOTHER....member of the Trans community telling me that she would "crawl through
broken glass" for HRC. A LOT of people are very grateful to her for her support of the travel changes that the
State Dept. has initiated. One more time for me to remind them that she's still "our girl." Have much fun
and a little relaxation this weekend!
