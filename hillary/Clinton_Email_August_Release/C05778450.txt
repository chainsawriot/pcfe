RAMALLAH (AP) - Palestinian negotiators are for the first time asking European countries to recognize a Palestinian state
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, even without a peace deal with Israel. The move is part of growing Palestinian
campaign to pursue statehood outside of peace talks with Israel, which have been deadlocked since
September. Palestinian officials say they asked the consuls general of France, Britain, Sweden and Denmark as well as
the European Union envoy to the peace process to recognize the 1967 borders between Israel and "Palestine." The EU
says it will recognize a Palestinian state "when appropriate," but that negotiations are the only way to peace.
