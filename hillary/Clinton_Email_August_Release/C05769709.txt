 Re: NI/tactic works


 The plan worked perfectly. Gordon made the speech in the late afternoon. Cameron felt
 compelled to support both the deal and the timing. Shaun called Lou Susman beforehand and
 Susman made a helpful call to Cameron "seeking clarification" an hour and a half before the
 event.

 Now, Reg Empey is boxed in. He's considering his position. It may be that you will have to call
 him in a couple days.

 Shaun will call you tomorrow at a time convenient to you.
