Subject: Greetings




                A favor.

                David Montgomery, a reporter for the WP, is (God help
me) doing a profile of me.

               Would you be willing to speak with him for 5 minutes?
His numbers are                        Campaigns, books, friendship, etc.

                I would be very grateful.

                P.S. Remind me when we next speak to tell you about some Palin comments about you.

                P.P.S. Also, about                   social life.

                Miss you. Thank you.
