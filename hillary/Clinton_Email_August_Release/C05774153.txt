Huma - pls see the note below from Mort Halperin. David Ramage, former President of the New World Foundation who
worked with the Secretary when she was on the Board of the Foundation, passed away, and his family wanted the
Secretary to be informed. Would it be possible for you to notify the Secretary?

Mike, I write to ask a personal favor. An old friend of mine named David Ramage died earlier this week
                           David was for many years the president of the New World Foundation. During that period the
Secretary served on the board of the foundation and worked with David. His family would like the Secretary to be
informed of David's death. Incidentally when I worked at the NSC I walked David over to the White House for a private
meeting with the First Lady which was just the two of them. I can provide additional details on the memorial service if
she were interested but the family's concern was only that she be informed. Mort
