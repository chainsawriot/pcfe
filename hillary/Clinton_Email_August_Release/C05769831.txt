Rep. Watson to retire
By Aaron Blake - 02/10/10 11:51 AM ET


Rep. Diane Watson (D-Calif.) is set to announce her retirement, according to Democratic sources.

Watson's central Los Angeles district isn't expected to be competitive in the general election, as it
carries a distinct Democratic advantage as a majority-minority district. President Barack Obama
won it 87-12 in 2008.

Former California State Assembly Speaker Karen Bass is thought to be an early front-runner to
replace Watson.

Watson, 76, has served in Congress since 2001. Prior to that, President Bill Clinton appointed her
ambassador to Micronesia.
