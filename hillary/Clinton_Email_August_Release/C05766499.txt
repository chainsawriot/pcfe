Checked with philippe on plane and he said hes professionally 100% ok for following reasons.
1) We did it for Copenhagen.
2) Condi would be dropped in Crawford on way home from foreign trips.
3) They already know and don't care.
But let me know if you want to change to dc, and I can easily tell Lew.
