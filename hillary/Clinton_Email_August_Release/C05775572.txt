Just read in the Sunday paper that the library was given a reprieve and will last until the end of the Des Plaines fiscal
year. Tuesday will be such a telling day. On paper there is a co-ordinated Democratic campaign in Illinois--however, it
is ghostlike—sort of shimmering in the distance. When WJC was here the other day, they all turned out: Dubrin and "the
other guy", Speaker Madigan, President Cullerton, many electeds and all gathered to have their photos taken with
him. What an assembly of power going nowhere—just finger pointing and hiding. Of course, they all smiled for WJC and
said they were working hard for the party       Is WJC the only one trying? Must be exhausting for him,„and you. Safe
travels. Awaiting the trick or treaters. It's a beautiful day for it. Love you, B

That is a sad sign and I'm afraid more to come.

Happy Halloween from Angkor Wat!

The Des Plaines Public Library Board Tuesday approved closing the library on Dec. 5 if the city of Des Plaines does not cosign a bank
loan of up to $1.5 million and Cook County property tax receipts are delayed.
