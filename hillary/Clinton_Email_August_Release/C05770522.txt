The House Appropriations Committee is apparently going to revise it's allocation for State/USAID — it is reportedly some
$1.3 billion better (!). So, the overall cut would be closer to $2.7 billion, not $4 billion. Will report back when that is
finalized. Some good news for a change.

Rich,


The Committee circulated a suballocations report to Full Committee members in advance of tomorrow's Full Committee
mark-up on the Mil/Qual and Transpo/HUD bills. Adoption of that report will be the first order of business. The S-FOPS
allocation proposed in that report is $53.983 billion, which is $1.327 billion above our provisional allocation and the
Subcommittee mark. We expect that our Minority Members will oppose the additional funds.

Hi Craig —


Am hearing that you are getting a new allocation that would be some $1.3 billion better for the 150
account....any truth to those rumors?


Thx.


Rich
