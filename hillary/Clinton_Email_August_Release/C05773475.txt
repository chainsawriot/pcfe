Subject: ROK army to hold largest ever live-fire drill (Reuters)

SEOUL (Reuters) - The Republic of Korea (ROK) army said it will hold its largest-ever live-fire drill near the
military border with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on December 23 in a show of force in the wake
of Pyongyang's attack on one of its islands last month. The drill, involving artillery, fighter jets and the largest
number of personnel in a peace-time exercise, comes after the ROK's live-fire artillery exercise on December
20 on the island near the tensely guarded sea border and is likely to infuriate Pyongyang. It will take place on
the ROK mainland.
