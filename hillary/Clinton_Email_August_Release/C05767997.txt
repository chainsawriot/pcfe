Subject: Information about                 of Little Rock                                                                    B6

Dear Ms. Mills:

It may be inappropriate for me to do this and if so I apologize in advance but I thought Secretary Clinton might want to
know, and probably didn't, about                         terminal illness. My understanding is that the Clintons' and        B6
            paths crossed in Arkansas politics in the past and in a friendly way.                                            B6

                                                                                                                             B6




I know all of this because I am originally from Little Rock, and have been told of                turn for the worse by a    B6
friend who teaches at UALR and knows                      Additionally,                                    who served in     B6
the state legislature for a decade or so, was my undergraduate advisor at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock in the
1960s.

I am emailing you in your capacity as the Secretary's chief of staff.

Again, my apologies if this is something I shouldn't have done.

Sincerely,

John M. Carland
Senior Historian
Office of the Historian
Department of State
