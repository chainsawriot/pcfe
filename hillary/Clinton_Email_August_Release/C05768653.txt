Jake,
We have one Working Group that will complete their work in 30 minutes or so. No material issues, just proofing
language. Russians will return to their Mission and by pre-agreement from earlier Anatoly will call tonight and confirm
that Protocol is agreed.
We have forwarded Ad Ref Treaty to DC this afternoon. Will forward Ad Ref Protocol tomorrow. Conformed version later
this week. Please let S know. Coming back to DC Thursday.
Ellen
