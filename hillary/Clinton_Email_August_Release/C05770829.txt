This is from Fr. Borys Gudziak, the wonderful priest you met in Lviv. He gave you a tour of the Cathedral and you had a
wonderful chat with him at the time. Since then, much progress has been made there. He became head of the new
Ukrainian Catholic University and has really come in to his own as a respected leader and scholar.
Unfortunately, his situation and that of the Catholic community and academic freedom has come under siege since
Yanokovich became president. I have a series of emails from the US Ukrainian community, in addition to this email
directly from Gudziak, They are alarmed about developments. I've been in touch with John Tefft and sent him everything.
He is aware of recent events.
I will make a folder of the correspondence for you since the community here and in Ukraine sees you as their champion.
This is not a good turn of events.

Subj: difficulties for UCU

 Dear Melanne,

 It has been awhile since we have been in touch. As you now we are under special pressure at the Ukrainian
 Catholic University. It is a question of our welfare and future. But not only. Almost no educational institutions
 have taken a stand in defense of democracy and even western Ukrainian politicians are capitulating under
 pressure. So is business. The approach of the new authorities is quick and systematic. Top and middle positions
 in all spheres of government, administration, state security, police have been rapidly changed and are
 effectively moving in on the freedom of the press and discourse.
 Our students are scared.
 Some are active, but some fear for the university, that it may loose accreditation. A father and his daughter-
 student came to my office in a state of anxiety.
 Some students are afraid to blog and post comments because they fear that they will be traced and that their
 parents will loose their jobs.
 There is clear evidence from one of our banks that the authorities are beginning to dig into the question of our
 finances. Provocations, moral defamation, planting of drugs and weapons in student residences as happened in
 2004 before the election could be next.
 The most effective defense is speaking out.

 I am grateful for your solicitude and wanted to ask for two things.

 1 To ask the Secretary of State to bring this to the attention of the president and vice president and to do what
 she can in our defense.

 2. to help us get the story to some of the main media outlets: New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street
 Journal, CNN, etc. One story by any of these for us and for the people in Ukraine that have the courage to
 speak the truth is invaluable.

We have had some great support already. But I have a sense that this adventure is only beginning and we have
to be ready for everything.

Please pass on my respect to Secretary Clinton.

May God bless you!
Fr. Borys
