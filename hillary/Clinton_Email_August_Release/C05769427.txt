Enforced transparency will countermand it.

I thought Collier's earlier idea of an Independent Service Authority was interesting as long as it was transitional
(toward a strengthened GOH) and had GOH authority from the get go.

I like your idea. At this point a reconstruction authority with Bellefive at its head makes sense. I like your idea
of a donor's coordination mechanism that I saw in your policy review powerpoint, with coordination on 'our'
side under the UN Special Envoy mechanism.

Maybe within the authority, there can be a private sector sub-group coordinated and monitored by the larger
authority? This sub-group might also include non-Haitians, including Dominicans.

Haiti's private sector will be less interested in decentralized investment, I think, especially if it focuses on
intensive labor and providing dignity and liveable wages to Haiti's people. This is a public works/public sector
initiative, in conjunction with international public sector organizations.

Sachs idea of the decentralized growth poles is also interesting - perhaps a way to mobilize decentralized
investment.

  This is helpful but raises the question, what can we do to countermand this.

I'm going to look to see what businesses these folks are in but this speaks more than ever to the need for a Haitian
reconstruction authority with Bellerive at the head with outside key donor or two like in the tsunami that has the
plenary authority to make decisions ideally free from this type of influence. What are thoughts you have heard in that
regard?

General and specific concerns: Specifically heard from Haiti is that Preval has acceded too much authority to
the Vorbe family.

Second, more general, is that the BAMBAM families (the term, I understand, created from the initials of the 6
leading elite families) are gearing up to inflate costs of doing things and to try to monopolize to the extent
they can. Will forward in a separate email one or two articles I've seen on this.

I'm off to Trinity to prepare my classes for this week. (A reality of my full-time teaching load). While check
email later. Thanks for this opportunity to share thoughts. Am very anxious to do this.

Can't miss the NFC game, even though the Eagles (I'm from Philly) already collapsed. I also lived in S.W.
Louisiana during the N.O. "Aints" years.

Best - Bob

  You and our secretary share similar concerns about making sure Haiti's future is decided by Haiti.




  When we met with PM and P, they both indicated they wanted US to play a large coordination role on their behalf
  to ensure their voice, plans and goals were accomplished. We are committed to doing that as they requested.




  I do think fast will mean some will make money they shouldn't — but goal is to have balance so we move with
  enough alacrity to build confidence that things are getting done.




   Who are the Haiti "operator" types of which this concern is being spoken?

I hope the GOH has back-up to hold firm to its positions. Some will want to push it around. Also, while
urgent need for tent cities clear PAP is clear, definitely not part of solution. Fearful of potential
permanance of them unless alternates for rural resettlement along lines of talking points exist.

Am hearing that lots of concern that Haiti's "operators" are licking their chops to make lots of money off
this. Fact of life or need to expand circle of actors?

Hang in there. - Bob

  Cheryl - See below the response of Leslie Voltaire and PM Jean Max Bellerive to talking points for
  tomorrow's Montreal meeting I proposed yesterday. Talking points at the end. Response positive. I have
  also shared these with Paul Farmer. Same response. Sources at the UN fear, however, that the donors
  will focus on PAP and miss this historic opportunity. - Bob

Leslie - First, thank god you were in NYC on Jan 12th. I hope your personal losses were
minimal. Surely, Haiti has lost much. We all have...

Thoughts for Montreal:

1. This offers an opportunity to 'rebalance' Haiti.
2. Pay attention to the exodus from PAP and catch up with it. (The migration to PAP over the past 30
years was an unnatural development, spurred by rural neglect and urban concentration.)
3. A decentralized system of 'welcome centers' in town and villages can assist returnees re-
integrate. Medical and continuing education services should be a part of them. NEED TO ACT NOW.
4. More important, the centers must be equipped to provide work - make them the basis for organizing

the civic service corps. Higly decentralized: work for cash; public works/environmental restoration/food
production; restoration of human dignity; rural-urban partnerships through work;e in Haiti's real
future. Also a chance to begin repairing the social fabric. Will need a 'tough love' approach; disciplined
management. Not the work for NG0s.
5. No investment in rural areas and no response to this opportunity will = back to the future re. crowded
PAP. People will trickle back to the city to replicate past problems.
6. The damage was done before the earthquake by development/investment policies that ignored the rural
areas; saw Haitians simply as sources of cheap labor; denigrated human dignity; failed to strengthen local
institutions.
7. This must stop; can't happen again.
8. This is the time to move forward with the Civic Service Corps - quickly.

kenbe. Pa lage. - Bob
