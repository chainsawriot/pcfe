En route back from India and China. It was good I went to Chennai where I had a full schedule including meeting with
another self-help group like SEWA (500 poor women showed up) It took me back to our trips. Also met with the local
elected village council -- remarkable group of empowered women. I took both experiences to our strategic dialogue
meeting in Delhi where we made excellent progress. We also met with the "cookstove" officials to give them heads up
about your initiative (told Roemer too). SEWA will be on stage with you at CGI!
Other good meetings with SEWA on markets, Afghanistan, and solar lanterns. Vital Voices conf was a huge succss. I
couldn't stay for much but your video was well received, Hormats was terrific (he's becoming a rock star with women!)
And F Secretary Rao did a nice job.

Our China experience provided a lot of insights and we will do a short strategy paper for you. We moved the women's
leadership forum forward. Suifficeth to say, there are so many opportunities that I believe we should be taking
advantage of, (which we are not doing) including in the economics track. The women there are growing in power and
influence. More later.

I'll see you for the NY marathon!
