    How to Friday: How to build a crisis reporting system
    Developers, technologists and volunteers around the world came together to build a crisis reporting
    for Haiti. Here's how they did it

                                   The Ushahidi crowdsourced crisis reporting in Haiti
    Technologists around the world came together and rapidly built a system for Haitians to request help in the wake of
    devastating earthquake. Using the internet to organise themselves, developers, communications experts and
    humanitarian organisations created a system to gather emergency requests using text messages that won praise
    from emergency officials and support from the US State Department.

    Hours after the quake, Josh Nesbit, who heads up a non-profit using mobile phones to help deliver medical care in
    Africa, heads sent this tweet:

Ushahidi is a crowd-sourced crisis reporting platform that was developed in Kenya to gather reports of violence in
the post-election unrest in 2008. Ushahidi, which means "testimony" in Swahili, has been used to gatherreports
about the swine flu outbreak, monitor elections in India and Mexico and to collect crime reports in Atlanta.
The platform can handle reports from a number of sources, via email, the web or via SMS, making it flexible and
very useful even in areas without intemet access. Ushahidi worked with teams in Kenya, Uganda and teams in
Boston and Washington DC in the United States.
Using Twitter, Josh got in contact with Jean-Marc Castera who was heading to the DigiCel command center,
according to Erik Hersman at Ushahidi. Working with the US State Department they were able to get the 4636 SMS
shortcode that had been used for weather information in Haiti. They launched the SMS-based emergency
information system with the support of the Thomson Reuters Foundation and technology disaster relief organisation
inSTEDD five da s after the suake.




Ten radio stations still operating in Haiti helped spread the word about the emergency shortcode. They also quickly
put up posters, and the US Department of State helped publicise it, announcing it via their official Twitter account
and elsewhere.
They worked with 10,000 Haitian volunteers to help translate the messages and other volunteers helped to structure
"mountains of data" coming into the system, Hersman wrote. The volunteers of Mission 4636 posted this on the
Ushahidi blog:
      We are the volunteer translators of Mission 4636. We span six time zones and seven languages on any
      given night. We are students, medics, stay at home mothers, archivists, firefighters, and software
      developers. We are the quiet force behind Ushahidi Haiti & we give a voice to the lost.
San Francisco startups, Crowdflower and Samasource, which specialise in managing tasks for crowdsourcing,
helped organise the volunteer efforts, according to Kim-Mai Cutler at VentureBeat. She also reported that Katie
Stanton, an early Google employee who now works in the Office of Innovation at the State Department, "helped get
emergency responders from the U.S. Coast Guard and Red Cross involved".
Since is started, Ushahidi has received nearly 100,000 reports concerning Haiti, and organisers are working to
create a system, Swift River, to help filter those reports so that the most urgent ones get attention quickly.
One thing that is impressive about this effort is how distributed, collaborated and organised it is, and they have
blogged about how theykept this volunteer project focused. CrisisCamps to help with these projects sprung up in
cities around the world, including here in London.

A decade of crowdsourced crisis projects

Developers also created an application to help collect information on missing people in Haiti. After creating several
applications, they came to a decision to focus their efforts on a single app hosted at Google.

The Haiti Earthquake people finding application is actually the evolution of similar projects that started appearing
after the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US and rapidly developed after the Asian Tsunami in late
2004, Hurricane Katrina PeopleFinder project in 2005, the and the earthquake in Kashmir in 2005. The projects
gave rise to an XML format called the People Finder Interchange Format.
Every time a disaster like this happens, the response has gotten more sophisticated and better organised. The
response in Haiti by this volunteer army has been deeply impressive, and they have built up the expertise so that
when the next disaster happens, they'll have new tools to help speed aid to victims in need.
