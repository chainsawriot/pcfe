JALALABAD (AFP) â€” A Taliban-style bomb attack killed a district governor in eastern Afghanistan on October 22, police
said. Khorsheed, the governor of Dur Baba in Nangarhar province, was driving to work when the improvised-explosive
device often used in insurgent attacks blew up his vehicle, said police spokesman Colonel Abdul Ghafour. Like many
Afghans, the official had only one name. "The district governor has been martyred. Three other people, his driver and
guards have been injured," Ghafour told AFP. He could not say who was behind the attack, but the tactics were typical
of the Taliban.
