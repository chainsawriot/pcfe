Ms Mills,

I got your email address in a message from my good friend, Kathleen Townsend, several months ago but have
never wanted to bother you directly. However, as the former head of humanitarian operations at USAID under
Pres. Clinton, I thought it appropriate to commend you and your colleagues on the excellent job that is being
done in the early days of the USG response to the tragedy in Haiti. The deployment of Coast Guard and
SouthComm resources, the immediate organization of an interdepartmental group to coordinate USG efforts,
the deployment of multiple USAID urban search and rescue units as well as a DART, and the ability to make
these decisions without delay is impressive. Managing information flow with early statements by the Pres. and
Sec. followed by your press conference on relief plans effectively focused attention on the US leadership
role. Please pass on my "good job" to whomever has been leading this effort. It's as good as I have seen from
the USG. Let me know if there is anyway I can be of help.

Hugh
