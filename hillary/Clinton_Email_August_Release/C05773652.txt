Subject: Bolivia sends formal letter recognizing Palestine (AP)

LA PAZ (AP) - Bolivia has formally declared its recognition of an independent and sovereign state of Palestine.
President Morales says his government "could not continue waiting with its arms crossed given the problems of
human rights, territory and sovereignty." A Foreign Ministry official later confirmed that Bolivia sent a letter to
Palestinian Authority President Abbas declaring its support. She spoke on condition of anonymity because she
is not authorized to talk to the news media. Bolivia joins the governments of Argentina, Cuba, Brazil and
Venezuela in supporting a sovereign state of Palestine with borders recognized prior to the 1967 Mideast war.
