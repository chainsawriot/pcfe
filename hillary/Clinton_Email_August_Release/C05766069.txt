Hi,

Attached is a new draft in which I have tried to pack in the changes/additions you requested yesterday (as well
as Cheryl's and Lissa's suggested edits).

To use a metaphor (or rather simile) of the season, we are at the stage where it's a bit like decorating a
Christmas tree: trying to hang the ornaments so no branch bends too much, and so the whole tree stays upright.

I wanted to get it to you first, but will circulate to the others now, and can send to Oscar if that's helpful in terms
of getting you a hard copy.

Dan
