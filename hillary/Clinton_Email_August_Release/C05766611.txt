Subject: Latest on Goldman Decision

Ops just passed us the following on latest developments in the Goldman case, courtesy of our Embassy in Brasilia:

-- David Goldman's Brazilian lawyer and the family's attorney are currently attempting to negotiate a "voluntary return."
--If those talks fail, Goldman will request the Brazilian police execute the involuntary return ordered yesterday by a
Brazilian judge. This outcome would create a negative PR climate.
--Brazilian police "think" they know the boy's whereabouts.
--Return to US likely will occur on an NBC News-chartered aircraft, as Goldman has inked some sort of exclusive deal w/
NBC for the story.
--Post has been working with WHA and PD on a possible S statement.
