Subject:                           Feingold letter



Rich is going to talk to Feingold's COS and walk him through the reasoning/defense of our policy. Since this is a classified
letter, you couldn't talk about it in open session tomorrow in any event, but if he asks you can say that we have had
substantive discussions with his staff on the concerns raised in the letter and you're happy to discuss it further in closed
session.
