                               Moments of imperial and economic decline
                               -- according to a recent poll, 65% of
                               Americans now believe this country to be
                               "in a state of decline" -- can also be periods
                               of cultishness, even of madness
                               incarnate. Such a mood now seems to be
                               spreading through the United States. It's
                               not so surprising, really: Since the attacks
                               of September 11, 2001, fear has
                               been iniiecttcl into this "homeland" like a
                               drug and a penumbia of official secrecy has
                               settled over the land in a way that makes
                               the secrecy of the Cold War years (when
                               this country faced a superpower, not a
                               ragtag set offihadis, guerrillas, and
                               terrorists) seem like an era of sunshine.
                               In an atmosphere of swirling fears and
                               hysteria amid declining living conditions,
                               "explanations" that at other times might
                                have remained confined to tiny crews of
                               conspiracy-mongers can suddenly gain a
                                patina of plausibility and so traction. No
                                wonder then that, as hard times hit, as the
                                financial system seemed on the verge of
                                collapse, as unemployment soared and a
                                massive wave of home foreclosures swept
                                into view, increasing numbers of
                                Americans became prey to any wacky
                                explanation for our troubles, none more so
                                than the idea that Islam was somehow

                            its way into state teal systems, or that

                                 It was at this point that the

                                 Project, the organizers
                                 settled on a campaign of
                                 years of nuisance lawsuits,
                                 along with accusations that
                                 the center had received
                                 foreign finding from "the

                                 rabbinical texts to declare
                                 that gentiles could be killed
                                 in order to "curb their evil
                                 inclinations." "There is
                                 justification," the rabbi
                                 proclaimed, "for killing
                                 babies if it is clear that they
                                 will grow up to harm us, and,
                                 in such a situation they' may
                                 be harmed deliberately, and

                                 for urging his supporters to

                                 raided his settlement

                                  candidate who has already
                                  been demonized as a crypto-
                                  Muslim runs for reelection,
                                  the country's most vocal
                                  Islamophobes could once
                                  again find a national
                                  platform amid the frenzied
                                  atmosphere of the campaign.
                                  By now, the Islamophobic
                                  crusade has gone beyond the
                                  right-wing pro-Israel
                                  activists, cyber-bigots, and
                                  ambitious hucksters who
                                  conceived it. It now belongs
                                  to leading Republican
                                  presidential candidates, top-
                                  rated cable news hosts, and
                                  crowds of Tea Party
                                  activists. As the fervor
                                  spreads, the crusaders are
                                  basking in the glory of what
                                  they accomplished. "I didn't
                                  choose this moment," Geller
                                  mused to the New York
                                  Times, "this moment chose
                                  me."
