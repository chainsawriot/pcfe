Subject: Your meeting with Simoes

Cheryl:

I met with Simoes last week, and he expressed his appreciation for your willingness to meet
with him. He has a high regard for you, and sees today's meeting as evidence of our respect
for and interest in Brazil's role in Haiti.

He is in D.C. trying to get IDB funding for an energy production project in Haiti. He
expressed frustration at the slow pace of decision-making            on nearly all issues                   1.4(B)
related to reconstruction and development, and also at the discrepancy within the                           1.4(E)
international community between pledged monies and actual obligation of funds.                              B1

Several other issues that you should be aware of.




Not good. I can fix all of this, and I have been working with Patriota and Simoes to keep
our conversations                                 on a positive plane. Again, I don't think
Simoes will raise this, but you should be aware that there is friction.

Finally, regarding your trip here, the second round of the elections is all consuming. Until
the outcome of the October 31 vote is in hand, I don't think you would get done here what you
would like to accomplish. You might want to raise this with Simoes. The polls still point
to a Dilma win, but it will be a fight to the finish. Could we think about a November or
December trip?

Happy to talk about any or all of this.

Regards,
Tom
