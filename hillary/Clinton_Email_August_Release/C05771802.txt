Here is the latest (as of Saturday at 12:30 am). This reflects the changes we discussed in our call on Wednesday, as well
as feedback from assorted vetters. I've also trimmed and tweezed it down to about
6,100 words. We should probably attempt to trim some more if we can.
It's a very long piece. -- Lissa
