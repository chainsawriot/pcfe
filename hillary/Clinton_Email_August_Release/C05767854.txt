Madam Secretary-

A few very quick notes for your visit here.

 -- Chileans of all stripes are still recovering physically and emotionally from
this earthquake.

        Bachelet's team initially underestimated the devastation in the affected
        area, but have moved quickly in the past 24 hours to restore public order
        which remains a major challenge.

         While Santiago looks superficially normal, there is still a huge cleanup
        effort ahead in the city and emotions are running high. Restoring
        services to Concepcion, Maule and the other affected areas will take
        weeks if not months. Without electricity there is no water or
        telecommunications.

        Chileans are proud and reluctant to accept much external support for the
        recovery effort. While they have grudgingly opened up to international
        offers of assistance, their wish list is short, and limited to very specific
        items. I believe they need to be much more expansive in their outreach
        to the international community. But this is a hard sell.

        With Bachelet, you should express condolences, review current and
        pending U.S. support, and seek out her views on how we can be most
        helpful moving forward. You should also compliment her on her social
        legacy and her record of leadership in the region. If there is time, you

      should also seek out her views on how the U.S. should position itself in
      the region in the next year.

      With Pinera, you should seek out his views on the current crisis
      (including the economic impact), and outline U.S. support. He will want
      to discuss his plans to support democracy strengthening in the region and
      raise his upcoming trip to the U.S.

      With the Embassy staff, you should express appreciation for their
      herculean 24/7 efforts to track down all Embassy staff, restore Embassy
      services, support and locate U.S. citizens throughout Chile, and
      coordinate immediate U.S. assistance with the Chilean government.

Many thanks!


Paul E. Simons
US. Ambassador
Santiago, Chile
