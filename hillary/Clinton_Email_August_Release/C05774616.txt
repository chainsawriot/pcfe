Subject:                           Scheduling



Here are a few odds and ends:

Since I'm going to the Bahrain Manama Conf in December, I want to decide where else I might go. The. climate conf in
Mexico will be held Nov 29-Dec 10. There is also a Dec 10 conf on trafficking in Luxor sponsored by Mrs. Mubarak that
Melanne hopes I could attend.

Add to list of meetings the following--

Ron Kirk
Hilda Solis
Walter Isaacsonâ€”high priority
Sandy Levin
Loretta Sanchez
Max Baucus
Eliot Engel

Ben Cardin wants me to come give a speech about the 35th anniversary of the Helsinki Accords on the Hill so I thought If
I'm going back to Helsinki for a speech about the Helinski Accords in July maybe I should do the Hill speech around that
time.

Also, Cheryl wants a staff retreat/meeting so what about May 14 or 28?

Did you get info about the Vietnam symposium the State historian, Carland, invited me to open on 9/29?

I want to plan to go to the Arctic Council in Greenland next April.

Did you find out when Cong Reyes's conf on border security was in August?
