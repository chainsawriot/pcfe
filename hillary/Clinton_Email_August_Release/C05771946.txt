  Re: GOP unpopularity, Boehner unpopularity, stealth agenda for campaign and beyond


     1. The Republican Party, despite everything, remains deeply unpopular. (See the second
         Ohio poll below.)
     7. The Republicans have made the election a referendum on Obarna and the Democrats,
         succeeding beyond their wildest dreams. (See the first poll below on Obama-Bush
         matchup and question 12 in second poll on Ohio voters' recall on who they voted for in
         2008, giving McCain a three point margin.)
     3. The Republicans have managed to hide their own negatives through the negative
         campaign against Obama.
     4. The campaign is not being conducted as a contest. The Republicans have succeeded in
         making it only about approval of °barna.
     5. The GOP is hiding John Boehner, who is unpopular in his home state of Ohio, where he's
         best known. To the extent he is known, he is disliked.
     6. The Republicans are pretending they offer something new and not really the same old
         Republicans, to the extent they make any sort of offer.
     7. The Tea Party is deliberately trying to hide its extremism behind a mask of novelty and
         now religious rhetoric. (The right wing strategy has been spelled out in detail to a friend
         of mine,



     8. So far, there is no Democratic campaign to focus on the Republicans and, therefore, no
        contest. Republicans are not being exposed for their increasing dependence on extremists.
        They are not being pressed for their refusal to denounce extremism. Nor is the Tea Party
        being revealed as an extremist takeover movement. Nor is the Republicans' motive for
        smearing Obama being identified as a cynical strategy to put Boehner in power.
     9. Whatever issue ginned up by Republicans—from illegal immigration to the "ground zero
        mosque"—is not about the issue itself. Everything, but everything, is about making John
        Boehner, that old scandal ridden hack Republican, the Speaker. No matter what the
        Republicans say, the ultimate issue is the Boehner power-grab.

     10. The Republican Party is the same old party. It's unreformed. It hasn't learned anything. It
         can't control its extremists.

  Previewing Ohio

  We'll start rolling out our Ohio poll results tomorrow but there's one finding on the poll that
  pretty much sums it up: by a 50-42 margin voters there say they'd rather have George W. Bush in
  the White House right now than Barack Obama.

  Independents hold that view by a 44-37 margin and there are more Democrats who would take
  Bush back (11%) than there are Republicans who think Obama's preferable (3%.)

  A couple months ago I thought the Pennsylvanias and Missouris and Ohios of the world were the
  biggest battlegrounds for 2010 but when you see numbers like this it makes you think it's
  probably actually the Californias and the Wisconsins and the Washingtons;

 There's not much doubt things are getting worse for Democrats.. .and they were already pretty
 bad. Somehow the party base needs to get reinvigorated over the next two months or there's
 going to be a very, very steep price to pay.

 GOP Leads OH Generic Ballot, Boehner Not Popular
 Raleigh, N.C. — Despite expanding their lead to 47-41 over Democrats in the generic
 Congressional ballot, only 29% of likely Ohio voters approve of the direction of the
 Republican Party, with 55% disapproving, suggesting that their preference for the GOP is
 simply a vote for change, not a vote of affirmation or a mandate. Also supporting that
 notion: a 43% plurality finds the GOP to be too conservative, with only 29% seeing their
 views as "about right."
 And in bad news for Minority Leader John Boehner, only 28% of his home-state voters

 want him to become Speaker if Republicans take back the U.S. House, with 44%
 preferring "someone else." GOP voters do support Boehner for Speaker, but only by a
 54-15 margin. Democrats, who would not vote for a Republican majority anyway,
 oppose him, 73-6, and independents, 41-22.
 In June, Republicans were favored for Congress only 44-43 among registered voters, but
 the six-point shift in the partisan makeup of the likely electorate corresponds almost
 exactly with the shift in the generic ballot. On top of that, Republicans are united around
 their party's candidates 94-1, versus Democrats at 89-6. Democrats have actually
 improved slightly among independents, though Republicans still lead 36-23. There is
 considerable room for Democratic House candidates to make up ground by appealing to
 the 41% of unaffiliateds who are undecided and by boosting turnout among their voters.
 While Republicans approve of the direction of their party, 59-20, independents
 disapprove, 61-13. 31% of Republicans and 20% of independents find the GOP too
 liberal, but 76% of Democrats and 43% of independents find it too conservative.
 There has been no change in the race for Attorney General. Mike DeWine leads
 Democrat Richard Cordray 44-40 after leading 44-41 in June.
 PPP surveyed 475 likely Ohio voters from August 27th to 29th. The margin of error for
 the survey is +1-4.5%. Other factors, such as refusal to be interviewed and weighting,
 may introduce additional error that is more difficult to quantify.

  racism leading up to election. (Thus theme of Faith, Hope, Charity.) Americans for Prosperity
  (Koch group) made sure there were no signs, etc.

  No love lost for post-1996 Republican hacks, among whom he numbered Gingrich, DeLay,
  Hastert -- and Rove who is on the outs with his people.

 Oversight committees will take lead in House after GOP victory, with a particular focus on
 Holder and Justice Dept. and KSM decision. Purpose will be to keep Democrats on defensive
 for whole 2 years leading up to 2012 election. (Obama, you recall, nixed investigations of Bush
 administration because he wanted to unite the country.) Would there be an investigation of
 Obama citizenship?? couldnt say b ecause he is now totally focused on the election, not what
 comes after.

                   My take: Of course House will vote to repeal health care reform (despite no
 chance of senate passage) ; funding dozens of EPA initiatives in Appropriations Committee, and
 there will be stand-alone vote to block EPA from implementing carbon rules (even though EPA
 is only acting as a result of a Supreme Court decision); and budget legislation that adopts part of
 the Ryan plan (tho not privatization of SS.)..
