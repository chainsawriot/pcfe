Subject: FW: Secretary Clinton video helps recruit host families!

The Secretary did such a mitzvah by recording a video message for us encouraging American families to host
exchange students. In a few short days the video has had a tremendous impact. We have heard from so many
people who work to recruit host families about what a major effect the video will have on their efforts. One
person even described showing the video on her mobile phone to someone who then agreed on the spot to host
an exchange student for the first time. In addition to the anecdotal stories we are hearing, the video has had
almost 6,500 views on our YouTube page, which is unheard of for an ECA-related video—especially one that's
only been up 2 days!

Recruiting host families and schools is a continual challenge, and is it imperative to the success of our programs
so we are so grateful for her contribution. This little bit will go a very long way. Please pass on our
appreciation to her.

I thought you might appreciate knowing that within the first hour of the video release by the State Department featuring
Secretary Clinton we found a host family! I appreciate the endorsement and recognition from the top at the State
Department for the incredible contributions American families make to youth exchange programs.

I am sharing the message below that we sent this afternoon to our thousands of host families, volunteers and alumni.

Kind regards,
Mike



Subject line: Secretary Clinton, my physical therapist's office, and YFU...

Dear fellow YFU'ers,

Earlier this week I was in my physical therapist's office filling out volumes of paperwork. I happened to be wearing my
YFU polo shirt, and the receptionist asked what Youth For Understanding was all about. While I was telling her, my Palm
beeped that I had a new message — it happened to be an email produced by the State Department of Secretary Clinton's
endorsement of hosting and international exchange. I opened the email and clicked on the link. The two receptionists, a
nurse and I huddled around my phone and watched Clinton speak to the importance of global exchange.

Luckily, I had saved several student profiles in my phone and was able to show the receptionists some of the unplaced
students right then and there. I am not sure whether it was the video or the profiles but once I told her my own YFU story,
one of the receptionists was hooked. She already has a student picked out, and her host family application is being
completed today! It feels wonderful to change the life of a teenager thousands of miles away and a newfound friend in my
own backyard.
