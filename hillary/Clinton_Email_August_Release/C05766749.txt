Subject: UNICEF chief Veneman won't seek second term

UNITED NATIONS - (AP) Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says UNICEF chief Ann Veneman will not seek a second
term. Ban expressed "great regret" Veneman was stepping down and praised her "immense dedication ... and
determination to improve children's health, education and well-being." Before being appointed to head UNICEF in
2005, Veneman was the first female U.S. secretary of agriculture in the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush.
Her term ends April 30, 2010. In a letter to friends and colleagues, Veneman said she was stepping down with "a
heavy heart," but gave no reason for her decision.
