Dear Burns:




It has been some time since we spoke so I wanted to start by wishing you a happy new year and thanking you for your
assistance in placing our corporate contribution for Haiti Relief through the Clinton Foundation.




My hope is that you can further help me with two very different requests related to the Haitian tragedy:




1.            After the tsunami devastated parts of Indonesia in 2004, I felt strongly that the CEOs of American
corporations involved in the planning, construction and operation of civil, energy, water and telecommunication
infrastructure should lead a charitable effort involving human as well as financial resources to develop an
implementation plan for the rebuilding of the country once the Red Cross, the Military and the other "first responders"
had stabilized the situation. I think the concept is even more relevant in 2010 with respect to Haiti which obviously is
much closer to the United States and has much less indigenous skills and resources of its own to apply to the rebuilding
effort. Given President Clinton's normal powers of persuasion and his passion for improving Haiti even before the
earthquake (it was the only thing he wanted to talk about when Isabella and I met with him in November), he would
have little difficulty recruiting a group of appropriate CEOs to form an "advisory council on Haitian infrastructure" (which

then could springboard to greater things and deeper commitments). If you could reach out to the appropriate person on
President Clinton's staff, we of course would be available to assist in giving shape to the concept, compiling a list of
names of infrastructure CEOs, etc.

2.           On a much more personal note, two friends of Isabella and mine,                      were in the final            B6
stages of adopting two infants out of a Haitian orphanage when the earthquake struck. Since that time, the process has
obviously stopped and they have had no word on the fate of these two babies, their welfare or the prospects for getting
them out of their earthquake-ravaged environment into their new home and family in the United States. I have attached
a significant amount of detail about the babies, the orphanage, etc.




Burns, I know President Clinton is devoting all of his herculean energy to humanitarian relief for Haiti at the macro level,
but knowing his humanistic approach, there must be someone on his staff who can help with these t â€¢e of individual
situations. Is it possible for you to find that person so that I can make the request and so our friend              can
provide him/her with any additional information that they might need?




I really appreciate your assistance with respect to both of these matters. Please do not hesitate to contact me night or
day on my cell phone




Come visit us in Princeton.




Best regards,




David Crane
