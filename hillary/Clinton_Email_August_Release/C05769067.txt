The regional psychiatrist is coming in tomorrow. I will meet with him as soon as he arrives and lay out the situation for
him and ask for his advice. It is clear that we need to start rotating personnel out soon even if it is just for a couple of
days. I will work on Consular and the Control Room team to start these rotations. We will need to see if our
medevacuees will become permanent before looking for replacements.

In the end they only medivaced one today. The other two still under observation. We could probably use good
replacements. David? KM

Gentlemen,

I believe we need a psychological specialist sent here as soon as possible. We're having to medivac two folks due to
nerves and high blood pressure and another one is simply not able to function (psychevac).                    I am
worried about the Consular staff as well: very tired, stressed and overworked. I hope you could get someone down here
tomorrow if possible.


We also need to get some people out of this building (my problem, I know). It's a real ant farm and a health disaster
waiting to happen.

Thanks.
