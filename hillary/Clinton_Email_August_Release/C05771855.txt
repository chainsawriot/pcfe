Subject: (AP) McCain: Time to discuss regime change' in DPRK

WASHINGTON (AP) - Sen. John McCain said it was time to discuss "regime change" in DPRK, but the former Navy combat
pilot didn't say how he advocates changing the government in the repressive and secretive dictatorship. McCain said he
was not suggesting military action against the North. He said the Chinese, the DPRK's closest ally, should rein in its
neighbor, and he accused Beijing of failing to play a responsible role in either the Korean peninsula, where tensions are
high because of a recent attack by the North, or the world stage. "The key to this, obviously, is China," McCain said on
"State of the Union" on CNN. "And, unfortunately, China is not behaving as a responsible world power. It cannot be in
China's long-term interest to see a renewed conflict on the Korean peninsula." The Arizona Republican added: "They
could bring the North Korean economy to its knees if they wanted to. And I cannot believe that the Chinese should, in a
mature fashion, not find it in their interest to restrain North Korea. So far, they are not." McCain said the Chinese
government's call for emergency talks was a "fine first step," but he questioned whether DPRK would stop its long
history of confrontation without significant penalties. "I think it's time we talked about regime change in North Korea,
and I do not mean military action, but I do believe that this is a very unstable regime," McCain said.
