The family visit was Respectful and alowed the families to have some closure.

Very shortly after arriving at the site I believe the families understood the magnitude of the devastation at the Hote
Montana and the reality of surviving such devastaion.

They thanked the Ambassador and Rescue teams, Consulate, etc who were Searching for their loved ones.

Given the sad situation - the families were greatful to speak with people who were searching for their children.

I am around tomorrow if you have any questions.
