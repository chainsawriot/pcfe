Fibi Netanyahu
In 2001, PM boasted of manipulating Oslo accords

BY LIEL LEIBOVITZ I Jul 15, 2010 4:03 PM I


Meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu last week, President Obama could not have been more effusive. "I believe Prime
Minister Netanyahu wants peace," Obama said. "I believe he is ready to take risks for peace."

A newly revealed tape of Netanyahu in 2001, being interviewed while he thinks the cameras are off, shows him in a
radically different light. In it, Netanyahu dismisses American foreign policy as easy to maneuver, boasts of having
derailed the Oslo accords with political trickery, and suggests that the only way to deal with the Palestinians is to
"beat them up, not once but repeatedly, beat them up so it hurts so badly, until it's unbearable" (all translations are
mine).

According to Haaretz's Gideon Levy, the video should be "Banned for viewing by children so as not to corrupt them,
and distributed around the country and the world so that everyone will know who leads the government of Israel."

Netanyahu is speaking to a small group of terror victims in the West Bank settlement of Ofra two years after
stepping down as prime minister in 1999. He appears laid-back. After claiming that the only way to deal with the
Palestinian Authority was a large-scale attack, Netanyahu was asked by one of the participants whether or not the
United States would let such an attack come to fruition.

"I know what America is," Netanyahu replied. "America is a thing you can move very easily, move it in the right
direction. They won't get in their way." He then called former president Bill Clinton "radically pro-Palestinian," and
went on to belittle the Oslo peace accords as vulnerable to manipulation. Since the accords state that Israel would

be allowed to hang on to pre-defined military zones in the West Bank, Netanyahu told his hosts that he could
torpedo the accords by defining vast swaths of land as just that.

"They asked me before the election if I'd honor [the Oslo accords]," Netanyahu said. "I said I would, but ... I'm going
to interpret the accords in such a way that would allow me to put an end to this galloping forward to the '67 borders.
How did we do it? Nobody said what defined military zones were. Defined military zones are security zones; as far
as I'm concerned, the entire Jordan Valley is a defined military zone. Go argue."

Smiling, Netanyahu then recalled how he forced former U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to agree to let
Israel alone determine which parts of the West Bank were to be defined as military zones. "They didn't want to give
me that letter," Netanyahu said, "so I didn't give them the Hebron agreement [the agreement giving Hebron back to
the Palestinians]. I cut the cabinet meeting short and said, 'I'm not signing.' Only when the letter came, during that
meeting, to me and to Arafat, did I ratify the Hebron agreement. Why is this important? Because from that moment
on, I de facto put an end to the Oslo accords."

President Obama, and anyone else concerned about Israel's commitment to the peace process, may watch the tape
online here.
