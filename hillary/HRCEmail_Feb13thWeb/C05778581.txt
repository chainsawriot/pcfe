Subject: Japanese Nuclear Fuel Rods Fully Exposed (SBU)

(SBU) Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) stated fuel rods at reactor No. 2 of the Pukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power
plant were once again fully exposed hours after authorities were able to stabilize a similar emergency, according to press.
Embassy Tokyo comments both TEPCO and the Japanese Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency confirmed to the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission the fuel rods were exposed at 1020 EDT/2320 Tokyo due to a valve closure blocking the
injection of sea water.
