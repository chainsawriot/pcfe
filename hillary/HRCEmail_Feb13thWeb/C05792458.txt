Sounds apocryphal, but there some kernel of something there, and at the core Bibi and Barak are at
war. Apparently Barak has crossed a red line.

Subject: H: a story. Sid

My son, Paul, the one who covers money & politics at the Huffington Post, last night, to break the
settling gloom as we watched the "debate," told me the following story:
According to Paul, another reporter at Huff Post told him that he was informed by a staffer on the
NSC that Barak was at the White House recently having a secret meeting with the President. At the
same time, Michael Oren had finished some meeting at the NSC and somehow heard that Barak was
in the building. Oren raced around the West Wing searching for Barak, opening doors and looking in
rooms. Donilon heard about Oren's frantic snooping and raced after him, catching him, and escorted
him out. Apocryphal? True? If false, it still reflects the split between Bibi and Barak. What is true is
that a reporter at Huff Post was told this story by an NSC staffer.
Biden has to save the day. Who knew?

Here's a tweet from Michael Moore last night during the "debate":

"Is Bill Clinton coming in to sub for the next quarter? 0! Wake up!
Attack! That is not john McCain over on that podium!"
