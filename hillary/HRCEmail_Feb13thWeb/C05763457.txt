Subject: FW: Rahm Emmanuel Political Hit List from Politico..


...Sources close to the White House have reported that Rahm Emanuel
maintains a political hit list, identifying legislators who might stand
in the way of the President's breakneck-speed agenda of outright        .
fascist austerity.

When Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton recently announced plans
to bring in a former top campaign aide and close friend, Sidney
Blumenthal, as a personal advisor at Foggy Bottom, Emanuel lashed out,
warning that BlumenthaPs appointment would be considered a "personal
slap in the face" to the President—an incredible act of chutzpah.

Some of the people on Emanuel's Congressional hit list, among them
Representatives with the greatest seniority, and the strongest "FDR
Democrat" credentials, have surfaced as recent targets of relentless
FBI investigation and a barrage of media leaks. Rep. John Murtha
(D-Pa.), Chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee; Rep.
Charles Rangel (D-NY), Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee,
perhaps the most powerful body in the House, responsible for all tax
legislation; and Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), Chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, who has championed a single-payer universal health
insurance plan, that was instantly deep-sixed by the President, are but
three leading elected officials who have been politically targeted by
the FBI—and are considered as potential obstacles to President Obama
and Rahm Emanuel's agenda.

Oindependently confirms that the FBI
is "out of control" and targeting leading members of Congress. "The
Bureau learned some lessons from their 1980s Abscam program, which was
a centralized sting operation, targeting a pre-set list of Congressmen
and Senators," the source elaborated. "Now, there is no code-named
centralized program. They are going after a similarly
politically-motivated list of targets, one at a time. They are
exploiting the extraordinary domestic spying powers they got after
9/11. It is very scary."
