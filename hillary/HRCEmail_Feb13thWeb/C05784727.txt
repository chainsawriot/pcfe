Thanks. Cable on my meetings with Bashir and Malik on the way soon (Jonathan drafting); no real specifics about their
reaction yet. ODRP reports Torkham is closed to NATO trucks, Chaman apparently open (though it's closed on Sunday,
so we won't know policy until Monday).

Ambassador Munter Expresses Regret for the Loss of Life in Cross-border Incident

Quote from U.S. Ambassador Cameron Munter:

"I have seen press accounts of an incident on the Pakistani-Afghan border in which Pakistani
soldiers were reportedly killed. I regret the loss of life of any Pakistani servicemen, and pledge
that the United States will work closely with Pakistan to investigate this incident."
