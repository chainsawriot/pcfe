Ok. Declan and I will give you more color on the Brown meeting when we pre-brief in the am. The advice below is
consistent with our recommended approach.

Hillary:

1. Everything went very well at the CGI N.I. event. Now, notes from a conversation with Shaun after he was in the
negotiations with Brown, Robins and McGuinness this evening:
2. In the meeting with Robinson in the morning, Shaun tells me that Robinson is nearly there but needs to be coaxed
along the line because he's more a manager than a leader and is filled with anxiety. The London papers on Thursday am
are splashed with front page stories on Obama's rebuff of Brown, refusing to meet with him, which has somewhat
transfixed Brown in his negotiations with Robinson last night, discombobulating him in his meeting.
                                                                                                                        1.4(D)
                                                                                                                        B1
                                                                                                                        1.4(B)




                                          Good luck.
