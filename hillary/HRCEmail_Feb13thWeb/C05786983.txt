Just got off the call with DG Ntsaluba. Will put the following in a cable as well. There is no confirmed
time for his departure. The only certain thing is that he needs to land in Haiti during the day time. It
appears at this point that he will be on a private charter. It could leave this afternoon or tomorrow—
no decision has been made yet and the flight path is also uncertain at this time. At a minimum he will
be accompanied by Danny Glover, Katherine Keanu (sp?), Amy Goodman, and James Early plus
some reporters plus one SAG official. Maxine Waters and at least one other member of the CBC will
be waiting for him on arrival in Haiti along with the SAG Ambassador.

                                                                                                                         1.4(B)

                                                                                                                         B1

Yes, what the latest rumors are that he will fly out on a plane arranged by Danny Glover (who just
landed in Joburg and is organizing the return) and Trans Africa at 3. They will have reporters on
board as well. I am supposed to get a call from the SAG in a half hour confirming this.. .will see if they
actually call.
