(LEAD) N. Korea says Bill Clinton visiting Pyongyang

SEOUL, Aug. 4 (Yonhap) -- North Korean state media said Tuesday former U.S. President Bill Clinton has arrived in
Pyongyang, a visit believed to be aimed at securing the release of two detained American journalists.

 "Bill Clinton, former president of the United States, and his party arrived here Tuesday by air," the official Korean
Central News Agency said in an unusually prompt report.

 The report said Clinton was greeted by Yang Hyong-sop, vice-president of the Presidium of the Supreme People's
Assembly, and Kim Kye-gwan, the North's vice foreign minister and chief nuclear envoy, at the airport.

  "A little girl presented a bouquet to Bill Clinton," the report, also broadcast by Radio Pyongyang and other state media,
said.

 The report did not state the purpose or length of Clinton's visit.

  Clinton, who served as U.S. president from 1993 to 2001, was to negotiate the release of the two journalists, Laura
Ling and Euna Lee of the San Francisco-based media group Current TV, sources said.

  The two were arrested in mid-March on the China-North Korea border while reporting on refugees fleeing the
impoverished North. They were sentenced to 12 years of hard labor by the North on charges of illegal entry and "hostile
acts."

Bill Clinton off to North Korea to discuss U.S. journalists
Mon Aug 3, 2009 9:04pm EDT


SEOUL (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Bill Clinton is on his way to North Korea to try to negotiate the release of two
American journalists convicted by the communist state of "grave crimes," South Korea's Yonhap news agency said on
Tuesday.

Clinton had already left for the North but had not yet arrived in Pyongyang, Yonhap said in a report from Washington
quoting a source familiar with the issue.

"As soon as he arrives, he will be entering negotiations with the North for the release of the female journalists," the source
was quoted as saying.

South Korean Foreign Ministry officials declined to comment, saying any announcement would come from Washington or
Pyongyang.

The journalists were sentenced last month to 12 years' hard labor by the North after they were arrested at the border with
China in March, accused of illegal entry and being "bent on slander."

The journalists, Euna Lee and Laura Ling, of U.S. media outlet Current TV co-founded by former U.S. Vice President Al
Gore, were arrested when working on a story near the border between North Korea and China.

Ling has told her sister by telephone that she and Lee broke North Korea's law. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the
former first lady, has urged Pyongyang to grant them amnesty.
