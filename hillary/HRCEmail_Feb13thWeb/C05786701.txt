(SBU) Embassy Kabul notes the vehicle-borne improvised explosive device targeted a three vehicle coalition forces
convoy traveling in the Darulaman area. The ultimate target was a U.S. military Rhino vehicle that appears to have
suffered significant damage. Initial information suggests there were multiple casualties, all of whom are reportedly
American military personnel or Department of Defense civilians.
