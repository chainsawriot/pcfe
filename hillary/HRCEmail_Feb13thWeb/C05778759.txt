Libya

(SBU) Benghazi DART: Due to the deteriorating security situation in Benghazi, USAID has
decided to pull the plug on the DART, which is currently positioned in Malta. AID/OFDA staff
will be heading back to Egypt and Embassy Tripoli staff serving on DART will return to
Washington.

(SBU) Regime Counter-offensive: Following their March 13 capture of the oil port of Marsa
al-Brega, pro-regime forces paused to resupply before continuing their eastward march towards
Ajdabiya, the next opposition-held town along the Gulf of Sirte, which is located 100 miles
west of Benghazi. Unconfirmed reports indicated that fighting has already begun in Ajdabiya
and state-run television is announcing that the regime has captured the town. Along the
Tunisian border, regime forces have also reportedly re-taken the town of Zuwara. The western
city of Misrata remains contested, with opposition forces holding the heart of the city, but pro-
regime forces regaining control of the airfield.

(SBU) LNC Outreach Update: An aide to Libyan National Council (LNC) chief Omar al Hariri
called Embassy Tripoli today, anxious about press reports stating that the Secretary told
Mahmoud Jibril in their March 14 meeting in Paris that no weapons would be provided to the
opposition. Embassy Tripoli explained that the Secretary's message was more nuanced, but
that we could not go into details over an open line. An envoy affiliated with Hariri was in
Rome on March 15 and our envoy plans to meet him on March 16.

(SBU) Russian Sanctions: On March 15, Moscow declared a travel ban and asset freeze on
Qadhafi and his family.
