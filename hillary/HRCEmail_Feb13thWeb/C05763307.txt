Sorry, I was tied up in meetings. I did not include everything, but only what I thought most important. I included a
readout from the 9:15 in case you wanted that as well.

SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED


Here are the highlights of the 8/4 Senior Staff Meeting:

        Cheryl Mills

             •     Noted the mission of former President Clinton to N. Korea and stressed the need for all statements
                   pertaining to this to come out of the White House. Robert Wood (PA) said he was planning to brief
                   today, but would refuse to answer any questions on this matter and refer journalists to the W/H
                   statement.

        Jack Lew

             •     Reported that Nita Lowey had released the hold on land in Afghanistan for the Ministry of Health. She
                   voiced concern, however, that the Department was using various means to circumvent limits Congress
                   is imposing on land acquisitions. Pat Kennedy insisted that this was not the case, adding that there are
                   clear legal restrictions on what we can and cannot do with real property abroad. (An example he cited
                   is the property associated with our old Chancery in Port-au-Prince where we cannot legally give the
                   property away, but the only real potential buyer is the Government of Haiti which has yet to make an
                   offer.)

        Rich Verma

             •     Said the SFRC Business Committee meeting today should report out 22 nominees. Noted a problem
                   with Mike Posner, but said he was working to keep him on the agenda. There are holds still on 17

                nominees, mostly by Senator Kyle, but Carlos Pascual seems ironically now to be free of all holds. The
                ambassador-designate for Canada, Jacobson, has a hearing scheduled for tomorrow, but we were
                unable to pair anyone with him.
            •   Jack Lew asked Rich where we are with respect to the report to Congress needed to allocate the
                remaining 15 percent of the Merida Initiative money to Mexico. Rich said that the report should be
                presented to Congress by August 13, after consultations with human rights NG0s. (Sheba Crocker
                indicated that Jim Steinberg's office has been hearing steadily from the NGO Community, including the
                head of Human Rights Watch, Tom Malinowski. Malinowski insists there would be no harm in
                withholding the money for now, since the Mexican Government is not in a position to expend the funds
                yet, and since it is not yet clear whether there will be civilian trials of military personnel accused of
                human rights violations.)
            •   There was a brief discussion of whether the titles of the nominees for E and EEB could be changed after
                their nominations and/or confirmation. M undertook to explore this further with L.

       Harold Koh


            •   Noted that he was reviewing a statement that AF wanted to put out in advance of the Secretary's arrival
                in Kenya

                                                      Harold said that L
                          Cheryl asked to see the statement before its release.

        Dan Smith


            •   Noted apparently no American Citizens killed or injured in today's air crash in Thailand.
            •   Said that both he and Pat Kennedy had flagged for Lew Lukens in the context of the Secretary's current
                travel the issue of airplane fuel shortages in South Africa as a result of labor unrest.

Here are the highlights of the Deputy Secretaries 9:15 chaired by Jack Lew:

        Curt Campbell


            •   Reiterated the need to maintain radio silence on former President Clinton's private, humanitarian trip to
                N Korea.

        Jack Lew


            •   Said we are in the home stretch on the senior reviews and hope to have a package ready for the
                Secretary upon her return from Africa. Indicated that overall OMB will likely think we are "aggressive"
                in our budget request, but that reflects the reality of the challenges we face in places like Afghanistan
                and Pakistan.

        Jeff Feltman


            •   Noted that the family of missing American Citizen Robert Levinson have now asked whether former
                President Clinton will travel to Iran to obtain the release of Mr. Levinson, even though the Iranians have
                never acknowledged holding him.
            •   Said it was clear after the visit of the Kuwaiti Amir that we have a lot of work to do on the Kuwaiti-Iraqi
                border issues.
            •   Noted that Abu Mazen had made a two-hour speech at the Fatah Party Congress that will provide plenty
                of grist for Israeli complaints.

     •   Said that the Israelis were already complaining about our statements with respect to the Shepherd's
         Hotel in Jerusalem.

 Craig Kelly

     •   Noted that Arias and Insulza are trying to arrange for a visit by Central American Foreign Ministers to
     •   Honduras to meet with Micheletti and associates. We think this is a good idea.

 Dan Fried

     •   Said he had met with the Uighurs in GTMO and six were inclined to accept the Palau offer. Also
         reported that 8 other detainees were in various stages of getting ready to be transferred.

 Dan Russell (EUR)

     •   Reported that there are continuing small incidents in Georgia similar the weekend flurry over S.
         Ossetia. Reported that we are urging restraint on all sides, but especially encouraging the Russians to
         make use of existing mechanisms to address any issues, noting that the Russians on the ground had not
         been available to answer the phone during last weekend's events.
