Readout of November 30 Security Council Discussions on Eritrea

After lengthy Security Council discussions, Gabon -- the principal sponsor of the new UNSCR to impose
sanctions on Eritrea -- decided not to call for a vote this evening, as originally planned, but rather to delay
adoption until Monday December 5.

During morning Security Council consultations on the draft UNSCR, several delegations said that they needed
more time to digest recent changes to the text. Russia/China made clear that if the UNSCR were brought to a
vote today, they would veto it on "technical" procedural grounds (i.e., rather than for reasons of
substance). South Africa further complained that the Council had not adequately considered its amendments,
which South Africa had only given to Gabon the night before. In light of these concerns and without
withdrawing its request for a vote later this evening, Gabon agreed to convene an experts meeting at noon to
review the South African amendments and other feedback. Gabon made clear that they were unwilling to
accept any substantive amendments to the text "in blue", although they might accommodate cosmetic
changes to show good faith.

As anticipated, South Africa, China and Russia used the experts meeting to seek deletion of key
provisions. Gabon, supported by the P-3 and Germany, pushed back against these amendments, but signaled
an openness to a few cosmetic edits. The UK also proposed a few purely technical changes to correct drafting
mistakes.

After the experts' negotiation, the Council held afternoon consultations to discuss the way forward. Gabon
announced that they would be willing to delay a vote until Monday December 5 -- but no longer -- in the
interests of goodwill and harmony and to give delegations more time. Gabon further explained that they
intended to circulate a slightly modified text later this evening that reflected only cosmetic changes from the
experts' discussion.

The Council then had a long discussion on the timing and procedure for a vote, with South Africa -- supported
less robustly by Russia and China -- attempting to postpone a vote indefinitely. Gabon held firm and said the
vote would be held Monday. Gabon won sympathy from some other delegations who were grateful for the
extra time, making South Africa appear even more isolated and inflexible. The Council agreed to the
Gabonese plan for a Monday vote.

The Council also discussed Eritrean President Isaias's repeated request to address the Council. Some Council
members argued that such a meeting (originally requested in late October) should occur just before adoption
of the UNSCR. Amb. Rice reiterated our view that such a meeting would be redundant and counterproductive,
but added that in light of the overwhelming support of Council members for such a meeting, the United States
could not block such a decision (a procedural matter to which the veto does not apply) and would fulfill its
host country obligations to grant Isaias entry. The Council President said that he will therefore extend an
invitation to Isaias and other heads of state in the region (Ethiopia, Uganda, Djibouti, Kenya, Somalia) to
meet with the Council at 10:00 a.m. on Monday December 5. A vote on the sanctions UNSCR will occur after
this meeting, no later than 3:00 p.m. Monday.

USUN will circulate the slightly edited text to Washington as soon as we receive it. It will not contain any
substantive changes.
