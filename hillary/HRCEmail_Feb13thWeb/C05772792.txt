Here is our last one for tonight. Looking better for New Democracy, but key will be Venizelos' insistence on SYRIZA's
participation. I think he will have to back off, but he fears the political consequences of leaving SYRIZA in the opposition.

(SBU) Key points:
    •    The projected returns based on 50% of ballots counted and the projected number of parliamentary seats (in
          parentheses) is as follows:
                  New Democracy (ND): 30.26% (130— includes 50-seat bonus for party receiving the most votes)

             o Radical Left Coalition (SYRIZA): 26.31% (70)
             o Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK): 12.66% (34)
             o Independent Greeks: 7.46% (20)
             o Golden Dawn: 6.95% (20)
             o Democratic Left (DIMAR): 6.06% (16)
             o Greek Communist Party (KKE) 4.43% (12)
   •     These projections may shift slightly in the next several hours, but should not change significantly.
   •     No party will have an absolute majority. President Papoulias can begin coalition formation negotiations as soon
         as tomorrow by inviting ND leader Antonis Samaras to take up to three days to form a majority coalition (151+
         seats).
             o If Samaras does not succeed, SYRIZA leader Alexis Tsipras will have up to three days to form a
                 government before the mandate would pass to PASOK leader Evangelos Venizelos.
             o If Venizelos does not succeed in three days, President Papoulias would have two days to try to forge a
                 viable coalition.
             o Were President Papoulias to be unsuccessful, a third round elections would be called.
   •     PASOK leader Venizelos said he believes President Papoulias should go directly to an all-party conference. He
         seeks the formation of a four party government, consisting of ND, SYRIZA, PASOK, and DIMAR.
             o Continued PASOK insistence that SYRIZA be part of the next government would greatly complicate
                 coalition negotiations.
   •     ND leader Samaras tonight called on parties that have "similar objectives to ND's" to form a government of
         "national salvation," stressing that "the country needs to be governed."
   •     SYRIZA leader Tsipras said tonight that SYRIZA will remain in opposition, and he called rejection of austerity
         measures as the only "viable solution" not only for Greeks, but also for Europeans.
