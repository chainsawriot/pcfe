Madame Secretary:

USAID's Nancy Lindborg and I are finishing a two day visit to Tunisia. We spent most of yesterday at the
border crossing of Ras Jdir, where we witnessed a well run operation supported by international organizations
and Tunisian officials. The willingness of the Tunisian government and people to respond generously to needs
in this crisis has been impressive. At this point there are probably upwards to 20,000 third country nationals at
the border, the majority of whom are from Bangladesh. Our $13 million contribution to the IOM is playing an
important role in helping to move this population out, and the hope is that they will be moved over a period of
ten days.

Nancy and I, accompanied by Ambassador Gordon Gray, had meetings today at the Foreign Ministry, Social
Affairs and Public Health. There were no significant developments out of those meetings, but we expressed our
deep commitment to continue to support the Tunisian government in efforts to meet this humanitarian
challenge. All the officials with whom we met were very appreciative.

Media interest in the visit has been substantial. Nancy and I will give a press conference shortly today, at which
we will announce an additional $17 million in USG support, including assistance to WFP, UNHCR, and ICRC.

We will also indicate that that brings our total contribution to nearly $50 million, on top of U.S. military support
for transport of Egyptians, and the deployment of several Disaster Assistance Response Teams.

We travel to Cairo tonight, and will return to Washington on Saturday.

Best,

Eric
