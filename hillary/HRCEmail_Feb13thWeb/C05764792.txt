I'm in touch with Shaun directly and will let you know once I get his account and UK reaction. On
Blair, you could still arrange this through press question at airport, or in Moscow have a member of
the press ask you a question about EU presidency. It's important to say this about Blair on European
soil. Sid

Sid--I just got this as I am heading for the Belfast airport. Not sure I could

have arranged it anyway. But, if I get a chance, I will certainly say something

positive. Let me know what you hear about today. Thx.

Re: Tony Blair/EU presidency



Jonathan Powell just sent me the note below, a message from Tony. My views are

below the note.



Jonathan's note:

Sid

If Hillary had a chance to say something* about TB being a good President of the

European Council if asked about it during her remaining time in Europe that

would be v helpful. The Austrian Chancellor has said today he doesn't want TB

because he was for Bush rather than the new Democratic Administration. So

something that indicated the new Administration would work with him - without

trying to interfere in internal European processes - would be very helpful.

Jonathan




My views:



1.         Even those Europeans who might want Blair as EU president might take

offense at a direct US endorsement, considering it an intrusion on a strictly EU

only decision. The Europeans, for example, constantly resent US endorsement of

Turkey's membership in the EU.

2.         But Europeans would not take offense at nice words said by you about

Blair without an explicit endorsement. The rap against him is=2

Othat he's "Bush's

poodle," and your positive comments would help erase that taint.

3.       You can have a member of the press ask you about the Austrian comment

about Blair or simply about the EU presidency. Then you can say that this is a

decision reserved for EU members but that you have strong and positive feelings

about Blair as an experienced and skilled statesman who has proved he is devoted

not only to Europe but also to strengthening the Transatlantic partnership.
