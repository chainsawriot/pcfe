Subject: MEK dept meeting

Dan Benjamin chaired an intra-Dept session on the MEK/Ashraf today, and the group will gather again on
Monday, following a meeting by UNHRC/UNAMI at Ashraf on Saturday and an Embassy meeting with the
MEK on Sunday. Main points:
  • UN: The UN is primed to register (at Ashraf) and interview (away from the camp) the 3200 camp
     residents, but needs: Iraqi approval of an interview location, Iraqi approval for the residents to return to
     camp (or, alternately, GO! and MEK agreement that the residents would relocate elsewhere in the
     country — as put forward by the Embassy earlier in the "Butler Plan"), MEK agreement that Iraqi
     nationals can participate in the process (i.e., in a support function — not as interviewers — which they
     currently reject), and materiel support (helicopter lift). PRM used the visit of UNHCR Guttierez this
     week to push hard for close UN coordination and appropriate resourcing of the operation.
  • Iraq: The GO! has as its main goal the dissolution of the camp and does not want the residents to return
     to Ashraf following interviews. It is not clear where the GOI would want the residents to go — to take up
      residence in an Iraqi urban center, to reconstitute elsewhere in Iraq, or to depart for Iran (although
      Maliki and other continue to say there will be no forced returns). 122 camp residents have warrants
      against them in Iraqi courts. Iraq has signed an agreement with Iran on the repatriation of residents to
      Iran, with ICRC attempting to track down a copy.
  • ,ICRC: has overseen the repatriation of 500 residents to date (over the last years). They are prepared to
      facilitate voluntary returns, including arranging modalities and monitoring treatment afterwards. The
      Regional Director will be here next week.
  • Returns: The 50 or so residents with other, non-Iranian passports, are beginning to empty out. 11 to
      Canada; 5 to the US (including 2 with U.S. criminal indictments, who will be met by law enforcement);
      7 to Italy; 3 to Australia; 3 to the Netherlands. The EU Special Adviser will be here next week and we
      can reinforce message on need for other countries to step up.
