Mike and Gayle:

I wanted to reach out to you to share that the Secretary would like to recommend               to serve on the
President's Global Development Council now that
              She was sorry to miss his last meeting yesterday.

As Gayle knows well, he has been a great partner                    Given his terrific work         and his previous
advisory roles for the UN, IFC, and international development organizations, he would be a strong addition to the
Council. I checked with him yesterday so I know he wants to continue serving the Administration in a development
support capacity.

 Below is his bio for your reference.

 Let me know if we can provide any additional information on his candidacy. I am also asking Heather to follow-up with
 PPO.

 Best.
