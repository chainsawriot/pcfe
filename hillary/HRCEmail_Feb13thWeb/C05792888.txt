L/H -

                                   meeting for Thursday afternoon, we're going to pull down the speech (Lona, I know you
sent out invites with all of our collective blessing) and reschedule it for Sept. We can promise the Asia Society that they
will get their speech. Philippe is cool with it. You guys cool?
