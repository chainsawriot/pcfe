I like the alternative if maximalist can't be gotten.

I've just hit up              again. If that fails - which it may - you'll have to appeal. One potential compromise is
flipping       and RCH, so RCH is in the bilat an       s in the lunch. RCH could then take the ministers not in the lunch
to lunch.

But I'm pursuing the maximal position.

Bot           and RCH should be in both.

I haven't seen the draft communique yet. I will see it today.

       s the guy that Eikenberry wouldn't allow to see Karzai - you and Leon and others had to fix that.

I talked to                last night - pushed the issue. Told them it was in their interest as much as ours to include RCH.
              is in bilat but not the lunch and RCH is in the lunch but not the bilat. I said, can't you add a chair in the
back corner - they weren't moved.

Before you call                     let me go back to them today.

Who knew that who sits in which meeting would occupy so much of our time!

Richard â€” the Palace called an hour before the NSC this evening and said that they had received a call from State Ops
informing them that SEN Graham wanted to speak to President Karzai, subject unknown, and relayed that President
Karzai wanted me to clarify.




Best,




Karl
