The Elysee announced on Friday that President Hollande has asked Jean-Marie Guehenno to lead France's defense
posture review. This was picked up by Inner City Press (UN-based blog) yesterday.

JMG confirmed to me that he has accepted the offer and it was a contributing factor in his decision to withdraw his
name from consideration for head of UNSMIS, upon MG Mood's departure. The UN is looking at alternative names now
for head of UNSMIS (if extended).

Even though the assignment with the French government is unpaid and only part-time, JMG is planning to step down as
Deputy JSE fairly soon. No decisions yet on if/how he will be replaced.

The UN has not formally announced JMG's departure yet, so pls protect until it does so.
