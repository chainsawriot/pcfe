Just what you wanted to see and needed. Nice picture, made up quote, but when asked in Israel whether I thought he
should be released, I said yes. Too bad there is no one out there wanting to quote from my speech at the Peres
conference on peace where I said it was necessary to change the dynamic given the lack of belief that both publics have
in the other side's commitment to the two state outcome. Since Israelis believe that Palestinians talk of two states in
terms of one Palestinian and one bi-national and Palestinians believe that Israel will never surrender control over them,
it will be hard for any political process to have credibility if steps are not taken by each side to demonstrate, "we are
actually committed to a two state outcome."
