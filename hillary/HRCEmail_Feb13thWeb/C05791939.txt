Hi all. Copying in Protocol Officer Nick Schmit and Embassy Addis control officer Shannon Cazeau.

I confirmed with the GOE this morning it is likely they will ask Amb Rice to speak for 5 minutes at the funeral — probably
at the first portion of the service at Meskel Square, which is a large open area in the center of the city where mass
events are traditionally held. Following that event a smaller group (including the USG del) will likely travel directly to the
Holy Trinity cathedral.

•The GOE is looking for our delegation list as soon as possible to facilitate with planning. Hadisse Tedesse, the head of
 the Gates Foundation office in Ethiopia, told me that Bill Gates will not/not come as originally suggested, but Joseph
 Stiglitz and Jesse Jackson are still in play as other distinguished Americans planning to attend.

Thanks and best regards, Molly

 I just returned from a meeting called by Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Berhane Gebrechristos (a senior party
 official who was with Meles in Belgium when he died). Berhane spoke to the diplomatic corps about the funeral
 planning. The funeral will be on September 2 in Addis likely from 0900-1300. Details to be confirmed. Delegations are
 welcome to begin arriving on September 1. The condolence book will be open from 1200-1600 on September 1 for
 visiting delegations. (The condolence book is now open for Ethiopians, who are allowed to come at specified times
 based on profession and affiliation, and there are crowds of people entering and exiting the PM's compound.)

 The Ugandan, Djiboutian, Kenyan, Rwandan, and South Sudanese Ambassadors all spoke and said their presidents
 and first ladies would be attending. SPLM will also join the South Sudanese delegation. The MFA had earlier asked me
 to speak to announce we would be sending a senior-level delegation to encourage others to follow our lead, but as we
 are in flux I did not speak publicly (nor did any other western diplomat). I've told the government and other diplomats
 we will be sending a large senior-level delegation likely headed by a cabinet official and including other officials from
 State, the NSS and Congress.

I spoke to Berhane afterwards and delivered our condolences personally — I couldn't get to him at the crush at the
airport on Monday night. I recalled that POTUS, 5, Amb Rice and Raj Shah had all issued statements of condolence, and
that he should expect us to send a large and senior delegation commensurate with our partnership and our respect for
Meles's achievements. He pulled me to him and hugged me and kissed me in front of everybody, which I believe
suggests a)                         and b) the GOE's great appreciation for the USG statements and the POTUS call            B6
yesterday.

The MFA wants to know ASAP who our delegation is for planning purposes.                  s and the Sheraton have been very
helpful in offering to set aside rooms, but the earlier we get in the better it will be.

Thanks all, Molly
