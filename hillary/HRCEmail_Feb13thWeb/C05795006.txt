How do you spell "relief"? "GLOCS"....

Thanks for all your support. And good work on Burma.

Happy 4th to you and yours.

Thanks for sticking with the Pakistan "apology" issue. We're in a much better place today, and it wouldn't have
happened if you hadn't persisted.

Jake will update you on a few other issues, including John Kerry's latest from his Gulf friends.
                                         Niâ–  lich sets the stage for a solid announcement when you're in Cambodia next
week.

Have a great Fourth.

Bill
