GM spoke with Levitte at 5:45 EST. GM made the same pitch as he made to Hague, Moratinos, and Frattini.

Levitte said that if tomorrow is successful, they will get a simple restatement of the December EU conclusions.

                                                                                                                          B1
                                                   ILevitte also said that Sarkozy will call Netanyahu tomorrow.          1.4(B)

This email is in the same spirit as Julia's previous readouts:

GM spoke to FS Hague at 1615 EST. GM raised tomorrow's EU FM meeting in Brussels and on the idea discussed earlier
with                      re: a re-affirmation of the principles of the EU December 2009 statement./



                                                                 Mitchell also mentioned that the Secretary spoke with
 Ashton earlier today.

 Hague referenced PM Cameron's conversations with both Netanyahu and Abbas, at our reuest, to urge serious and
 credible direct negotiations. He said a readout should be circulating among the USG (note: Mitchell indicated that he
 had not seen it. If you have it, please circulate).
