I'm so happy things have worked out thus far as they did in Lybia, Harold -- happy for the people there, happy for NATO,
happy for the administration, and happy for you personally. It's true that I was among the people who were
unpersuaded by your and the WH's legal view of what constitute "hostilities," and I know hindsight can be 20/20, but in
retrospect I have to say that your view of the matter may have been the wiser one. We obviously can't know precisely
what the future there will hold, but thus far it's a marvelous triumph and one that sacrificed no American lives and
relatively little American treasure.
