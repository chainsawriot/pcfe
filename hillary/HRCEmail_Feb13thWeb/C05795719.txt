My apologies, it is still on -- I believe we said 6:30pm start time on Tuesday with you joining when the PC concluded.

Just got the line and don't see a mtg w        for the 14th. That's the only day       will be in DC which is why we have   B6
to do it then. flwanted it late in the day, so maybe it could start at 6:30 w CVC and I could join as soon as PC is over
around 7?
