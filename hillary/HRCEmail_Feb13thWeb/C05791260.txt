All: Had a phone conversation            this morning.




Given this, she said she intends to proceed as follows:




2) Tomorrow morning here she will have a formal discussion with her party on the matter resulting in a press release.
The public announcement will convey her/the NLD's renew and waive position, her reasoning, and reiterate her
concerns about responsible international engagement and need for enhanced transparency. She will make known again
her concerns about MOGE and ask that all nations that work with MOGE publicize the extent of any financial
transactions involved. (NOTE:



3) Late morning during a break in parliamentary action she will convey her views to the speaker's office.
