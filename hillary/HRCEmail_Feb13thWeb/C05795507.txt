   I think I'll leave to when we talk someday what all we champions have been learning about the
   ways of DeMint and his crew, but as a citizen and human being, it has been profoundly
   depressing.

   I was part of a roundup by Kerry joined by Lugar, Warner, Breaux, Lott, and a top lobbyist for the
   Chamber, last evening after the votes, and everyone decided to press on making the case with
   the hope of a post-election changed terrain where facts and the like just may prevail. I think
   we're all doubtful of that, but I know my own boss and leadership agree with pressing on
   because of our belief that ratification is the noble and right thing to do for the country. At a time
   when everyone claims the economy and jobs are at the top of their list, it is beyond depressing
   and confounding that this "jobs bill" is being spat on and losing potential votes to threats of
   "being Lugarized" and more.

   To switch Pew-related topics, I also wanted to let you know that we published today a full-page
   ad with the President's photo, page A9 in the NYT, signing the food safety law last January with
   his tag-line "We Cannot Wait," because of the enormous frustration over the WH not issuing the
   proposed rules to implement this historic law. As you can imagine, talking with Jack and Nancy-
   Ann and others who are friends and allies on almost everything has been painful, but I joined my
   workplace's allies on this issue in concluding that if the President's people are so fearful of
   criticism that they won't act to protect public health that we owe it to the public to showcase the
   support for those actions and that the support includes most of the food industry along with what
   every poll tells us about public passion for safe food. Just wanted to let you know.

   Safe travels home, and hope to see you soon. Sighs galore. Love, T
