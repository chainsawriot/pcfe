I hadn't heard that! As a Minnesotan, I'm offended.

Treasury is on the ground in Strasbourg (apparently your co-signed letter to Buzek really got Geithner's head in the
game, so Treasury is now actively engaged). Our European ambassadors and DCMs are calling parliamentarians across
Europe. Bill Kennard and Phil and his team are working the EP crowd.

Apparently late in the evening Brussels time the sponsor of the bill offered a deal to postpone until June, but EUR says
we are by no means out of the woods yet.

Hopefully by 9 am our time tomorrow we'll have a better sense of the vote count. EUR will make further
recommendations on your engagement tomorrow.

But I just heard that federal agencies will be closed again tomorrow! What are we doing to avoid or win the EP vote on
2/11?

Phil got a readout from Ops following the call. Memcon will be done tomorrow because of the snow day.
