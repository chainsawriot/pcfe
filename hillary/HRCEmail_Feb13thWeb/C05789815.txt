Jake,
Johnnie and I spoke and we all now agree that we should suspend assistance and have Toria say so from podium
today. Maria checked with L and there is no formal determination needed. If SPth floor are agreed, Toria can
announce. Please affirm by way of this email that Toria can do so. Thanks very much.
Wendy
