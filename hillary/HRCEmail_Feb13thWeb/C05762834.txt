Got it, Hillary. Thanks. Here are the items I was trying to get to you on
via Cheryl so as not to bother you directly:

   1. I wanted to take a quiet sounding with you about possibly getting a
      bit of your time for the Brookings board of trustees and International
      Advisory Council during the day on June 4. As you know, we've got
      a very distinguished board which you met a week after the 2004
      election, plus a group of 20+ high-level international types (an
                                            etc.). We could do what I'm
      hoping for in a way that minimizes the imposition on your time—i.e.,
      by bringing the group into the department an assemble in the Loy
      Henderson auditorium (or whatever it's called these days, or a similar
      1st floor venue), and you'd come down and talk to us for 15 minutes
      and take 15 minutes of questions—over and out. (We'll be having
      dinner that night with Ban Ki-Moon, and they'll be having sessions
      with Kissinger and with some other Administration folks.)

   2. I've got mounting concerns about what's likely to happen with regard
      to the White House's inclinations on US ambassador to Tokyo—and
      my concerns are occasioned in part by increasingly nervous, worried
      calls and visits from Japanese. You got the relationship off to a very
      reassuring start with your going to Tokyo at the beginning of your
      Asia trip. I'd hate to see that diminished by an appointment that falls
      way short of the Reischauer/Mansfield/Mondale/Tom Foley/Howard
      Baker tradition.

  3. Finally, I heard great reports on your Town Meeting in Iraq over the
     weekend, both from Chris and from another friend and former
                            who's slated to go to       as ambassador.

    Once Cheryl and your team are accessible by e-mail, I'll go back into
    those channels so as not intrude on your corner of cyberspace.

    Warm regards, Strobe
