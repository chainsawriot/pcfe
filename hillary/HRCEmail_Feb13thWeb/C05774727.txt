I'm not, unfortunately. Easter interfered with my plans to stay for the championship!

I'm in the office, just trying to keep up as usual.

A few things to report:




                                                                                      Will fill you in at your convenience.




4.
                                                that we should discuss with Huma and Lona.


5. We're working on a draft of your speech for Friday and should have something to you tomorrow end of day to react
to.

6. I'm about to get on secure call with the Israel crew. Will report.

7. I've sent Huma the AfPak weekly -- we're hoping to send it over to the NSC tonight if you get a chance to review.

8. Finally (sorry for the list!), Paul talked to Lute today, who said they would rework the Pak Strat Dialogue proposal and
revert.

 Are you still in basketball-crazed Indianoplace?

I did not mention this because not sure how I felt about it, but if all agree it would help, I will call her.

Hi Jake,

You'll see that the Secretary's points for Ashton mention the idea of our sending an inter-agency expert team to Brussels
for the next few months to improve US-EU coordination on Iran sanctions prep. EU officials had been receptive, but
now the bureaucrats are saying this would be "counter-productive", and instead prefer more regular videoconferences.
Which is probably OK. Anyway, I just wanted you to know the background, in case it comes up in the Ashton meeting.

Steve
