 Re: Saudi Arabia/Iran/Turkey

 Hekan was speaking in relation to the Iranian assassination plot against the Saudi Arabian
 Ambassador to the United States, Adel Al-Jubier, reminding Erdogan that earlier in 2011 King
 Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and his closest advisors had raised the possibility of Turkey
 replacing the United States as the security guarantor for the Kingdom, particularly in relation to
 Iran. According to this source, he added that reporting from clandestine sources and other
 liaison services, including the Saudi Government Intelligence Presidency (Rilsat Al-Istilchbarat
 Al-'Amah - GIP), indicated that it was not clear at what level of the Iranian Government the
 operation was approved. That said Hekan believes the details of the operation were certainly
 known to Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commanding General Mohammad Ali
 Jafari, and the commander of the IRGC QUDS Force, General Qassem Soleimani, as well as
 senior officers in the Ministry of Intelligence and National Security (MOIS).

  (Source Comment: Hekan added that in the opinion of TNIO analysts, influential individuals in
  the leadership of the Iranian Government believe that the time has come to establish themselves
  as the dominant power in the Middle East. By the same token, the commanders of the IRGC and
  their political allies in the Iranian regime are convinced that Saudi Arabia has been weakened by
  the pro-democracy movement spreading through the Middle East. In addition, these sources
  believe that the IRGC commanders are confident that Saudi Arabia's increasingly complicated

 relationship with the United States will make it difficult for the Saudi royal family and their
 allies to manage events in the region. In the meantime, these individuals added that the IRGC
 and MOIS are operationally active in carefully selected areas such as Bahrain and Eastern Saudi
 Arabia, where they can count on large Shiite populations to support their goals. He noted that
 although Saudi and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) troops were able to save the Sunni rulers of
 Bahrain, they have been unable to wrap up the MOIS/IRGC clandestine operational networks
 throughout the country. These operatives are in a position to stir new unrest when the situation
 allows.)




 (Source Comment: According to this knowledgeable source, Hekan is concerned that an attack
 against a high profile target like Jubeir could lead to a Saudi reprisal, with subsequent retaliatory
 attacks against the Saudi's and their allies by the IRGC and Hezbollah. In the same context,
 Hekan is concerned that the IRGC commanders and others in Iran are convinced that the United
 States will not react with military force to such an attack. In this scenario, the TNIO commander
 warns, an incident in the region could easily lead to a series of events that will ultimately involve
 Turkish forces in direct conflict with the Syrian Army, the IRGC, or in a worst case scenario the
 Iranian National Army. )

 In conclusion, these knowledgeable individuals are concerned that Western business and banking
 interests in the Middle East will become targets of opportunity for the IRGC, Hezbollah, MOIS,
 and their local supporters in this rapidly developing situation. In their opinion, these firms must
 take all possible steps to protect their interests and personnel over at least the next year.

 (Source Comment: A separate knowledgeable source commented that in looking at the Jubeir
 plot, it is not unusual for the IRGC, the MOIS, and even Hezbollah to use local criminals to carry
 out attacks on selected targets.)

 Re: Hezbollah & Cuba


 During the week of September 5, 2011 extremely sensitive sources reported in confidence that
 the Israeli Intelligence and Security Service (Mossad) has informed the leadership of the Israeli
 Government that Hezbollah is establishing an operational base in Cuba, designed to support
 terrorist attacks throughout Latin America. While this operation is aimed particularly at Israeli
 diplomatic and business interests, these sources believe that Hezbollah supporters have been
 instructed to also begin casing facilities associated with the United States and the United
 Kingdom, including diplomatic missions, major banks, and businesses in the region. These
 individuals believe that the Hezbollah military commanders in Lebanon and Syria view these
 U.S. and U.K. entities as contingency targets to be attacked in the event of U.S. and British
 military intervention in either Syria or Iran, at some point in the future.

 (Source Comment: One particularly sensitive source noted that during the 1980s reliable
 information indicated that Hezbollah carried out similar contingency casing operations against
 U.S., British, and Israeli facilities and businesses in Latin America, Europe and North Africa.
 This source also notes that there is at least one precedent for operational use of these contingency
 plans: On March 17, 1992 the terrorist group Islamic Jihad destroyed the Israeli Embassy in
 Buenos Aires, Argentina with a bomb hidden in a small truck; acting on behalf of Hezbollah in
 retaliation for the death of Hezbollah General Secretary Abbas al-Musawi in February 1992 at
 the hands of Israeli forces. In the opinion of this sensitive source Hezbollah operatives cased the
 Israeli Embassy at an earlier date as part of a contingency plan of attack that was activated
 following Musawi's death.)

  The Hezbollah office in Cuba is being established under direct orders from the current General
  Secretary Hasan Nasrallah, who replaced Musawi in 1992. According to the information
  available to this source, in preparation for establishment of the base, Nasrallah, working from
  inside of Lebanon, carried out secret negotiations with representatives of the Cuban Government,
  particularly the Cuban Intelligence Service (General Intelligence Directorate — DGI), agreeing to
, maintain a very low profile inside of Cuba. Nasrallah also promised to take measures to avoid

  any trail of evidence that could lead back to Cuba in the event of a Hezbollah attack in Latin
  America.

 (Source Comment: According to this knowledgeable individual, it is not clear that the DGI
 assisted with either the establishment or development of cover for the Office.)

 In the opinion of these individuals, Nasrallah hopes to link future terrorist attacks in Latin
 America to the February 12, 2008 assassination of Hezbollah senior military operative Imad
 Mugniyeh in Syria. While many knowledgeable individuals in the Middle East believe that
 Mugniyeh was killed by his rivals inside of Hezbollah, Nasrallah wishes to link the death to
 Israel. According to this sensitive source, Nasrallah believes that an attack in Latin America
 would be an excellent symbolic gesture for such a statement, since Mugniyeh is credited with
 organizing the 1992 Buenos Aires attack on the Israeli Embassy. (Note: As mentioned above.)
 This same source indicated that the Hezbollah military planners believe their operational and
 support cells in Paraguay, Brazil and Venezuela are best prepared to carry out active operations
 at this time, if they can receive effective support from the base in Cuba.

 (Source Comment: In the opinion of a particularly sensitive source, these Hezbollah cells in
 Latin America are relatively small, and maintain low profiles in their home countries. According
 to this individual, these cells draw their base of support from the Lebanese communities in these
 countries.)
