Hillary, I've been trying to get a couple of reasonably time-sensitive messages to you for a
couple of weeks via Cheryl's State Department e-mail, and I've heard nothing back. Is there a
different channel I should use? Strobe

PS: here's the last one I sent, with an attachment of the earlier one.....


Cheryl, I'm resending a message that I first sent on April 14. I can imagine how flooded your
inbox is, but I'd be grateful if you could give me some idea of whether what I'm proposing
below might work. If there's any chance, I'll send you the full list of people from the Board
and Int'l Advisory Council.
  BTW, I've heard terrific reports about the Sec's Town Meeting in Iraq yesterda , including
from my friend                                   , who I gather is slated to go to       as
ambassador. He's as good as they get.
  One other thing (speaking of ambassadorships), I'm concerned about what I gather may
happen with regard to the Tokyo embassy—not least because the Japanese are getting
concerned. I realize the locus of decision-making there is the White House, but given the
terrific start the HRC gave to the US-Japan relationship by going to Tokyo first on her trip to
Asia, I'd be sorry to see any setback there.
   Here follows my earlier message....



Hi, Cheryl. I wanted to take a quiet sounding with you about possibly getting a bit of time for
the Brookings board of trustees and International Advisory Council on June 4. If there's any
possibility at all, I'll come in, via any channel you suggest, with a formal request, but here's the
essence of it: we've got a very distinguished board which she's met with before (a week after
the 2004 election), plus a group of 20+ high-level international types (
                              etc.). We could do it in a way that minimizes the imposition on her
time—i.e., bring the group into the department an assemble in the Loy Henderson auditorium
(or whatever it's called these days, or a similar 1st floor venue), and she comes down and talks
to us for 15 minutes and take 15 minutes of questions, over and out. We did this with Condi
and it worked well. Just so you'll know, we'll be having dinner that night with Ban Ki-Moon,
and they'll be having sessions with Kissinger and with someone high up either in the Intel
Community or Defense.
  Regards—and congrats on how well things seem to be going.
