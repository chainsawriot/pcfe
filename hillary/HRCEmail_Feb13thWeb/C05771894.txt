I hope you had a good Thanksgiving.

Below is a quick update on Sudan:

For a couple of weeks now we have been waiting for the North and South to meet with Mbeki to negotiate a resolution
to Abyei. On November 27th, Bashir and VP Kiir met with Mbeki (along with a couple others from each side) to discuss a
paper prepared by Mbeki, which he presented for the first time at the meeting.




Best,
Mike
