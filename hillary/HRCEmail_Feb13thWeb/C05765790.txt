 SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED

 Palestinian Authority Assistance

     •     Jack reported that the Palestinian Authority is running out of money and we need to determine what we can do
           and when. He noted that we can provide up to $75 million under the Continuing Resolution, but the PA needs
           $180 million. The idea would be to use our offer to get others to fulfill their commitments.
                                                                                                                            1.4(D)
                                                                                                                            B1

 Somalia

     •                                                                                                                         B5




 Honduras

     •     Bill noted that Craig Kelly will be heading back to Honduras tomorrow to continue efforts there.

 Russia

     •     The President's meeting with Medvedev had been good with respect to Iran.

 India

     •     Bill said he will speak to Indian Foreign Secretary Rao tomorrow and review where we stand prior to PM Singh's
           arrival on Sunday. In the subsequent meeting, Bob Blake indicated he thinks we will have credible deliverables
           in all five pillars. P and SCA will send a note to the Secretary after the conversation with Rao tomorrow.

 Congressional Issues

     •     Late Friday, Senator Lugar lifted his hold on agricultural assistance to Afghanistan.

     •     Raj Shah begins an aggressive round of Hill meetings this week.

     •    Rose Gottemoeller indicated that the visit of Senators Feinstein and Kyle to Geneva had gone well.

     •       Senator Lugar is introducing legislation that would provide a "bridge" if START is not signed on time.



     •       Still looking at Afghanistan/Pakistan rollout and possible hearing for the Secretary with Gates and Mullen on
             December 1.

Legal Issues

     •       Harold noted he was following up on the Secretary's decision to let the court know of general U.S. interests that
             could be affected by the Gilmore case involving a default judgment against the Palestinian Authority. DOJ
             seemed to be balking, however, so it is not clear whether we will have to escalate.

     •       With respect to the upcoming ICC conference, Harold noted that we would "be present and be low key,"
             although DoD is attempting to "micromanage" things, a reflection of their general hostility toward the ICC.

     •       There will be a filing today in the DC Circuit Court on Bagram arguing against the right of habeas for prisoners
             there. So far, the NGO community has been remarkably quiet.

Public Affairs

         O    There will be an IAEA report on Iranian compliance this afternoon that will likely leak out quickly.

         O    Expect questions on Palestinian request for unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as
              its capital.
