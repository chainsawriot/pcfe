Subject: view from the field on emerging arguments tor a Syria no-fly zone

Dear all,

For the last several weeks, we have had a team in northern Syria, documenting government attacks,
monitoring opposition conduct, and establishing relationships with rebel commanders. Unlike in Libya, we've
not been able to do this until recently, which is why we have been cautious in making recommendations to
you. But now that we've spent some time on the ground, I wanted to convey some of our team's initial
conclusions on what is to be done. In short, they went in extremely skeptical about the merits of any sort of
military intervention, but have come to believe that the situation is evolving in ways that argue strongly in
favor of establishing a no-fly zone.

First, as we've all seen, the regime has significantly increased its use of air power. It has done so not just to hit
FSA positions on the front lines in cities like Aleppo. Of even greater concern, while our team was there, they
recorded daily strikes on smaller towns and villages in the countryside across northern Aleppo province, as
well as Idlib, Homs, the Lattakiya mountains, etc. These strikes kill scores of civilians (see our report on the
strike in Azaz, in which jets used extremely heavy ordnance and flattened a residential block the size of a
football field) and do not give government forces any immediate, direct military advantage. Their aim appears
to be to draw FSA fighters away from front line positions in places like Aleppo city — all of them have families
in the countryside, and when bombings happen the fighters rush back home to help.

Second, though of course we cannot be certain of this, it is our team's assessment that the rebel forces are
now strong enough, due to their numbers, growing experience, and sheer determination (despite
disorganization and lack of heavy weapons) that they could hold significant amounts of territory in northern
Syria if regime air power — and air power alone -- were taken off the table. Air power — fixed wing and
helicopter — is allowing the regime to strike in places behind the front lines that its ground forces for now
cannot penetrate. Many strikes have targeted opposition "headquarters" that are in fact buildings used by
newly established civilian administrations, relief committees, courts, prisons, etc. They are making it harder

for the opposition to establish governance over territory it would otherwise securely control. And as
mentioned above, they divert rebels from front line positions, so that air strikes in one location potentially
allow regime ground forces or militia to move in for the kill elsewhere.

A few weeks ago, we would have said that a no-fly zone alone would be useless in Syria; that any military
intervention, to be effective, would at least have to establish a no-drive zone, taking out artillery and tanks
being used to besiege opposition strongholds. Having spent time with numerous opposition leaders, and seen
how rebel forces have held out in Aleppo neighbourhoods despite constant pounding, our team came away
with the sense that this has changed —that taking out air power alone could allow the opposition to establish
and consolidate a true safe area in the north. This would bring tremendous benefits — protection from
atrocities, security for humanitarian aid (of which we've seen virtually none), space for the opposition to come
together politically, with international support, on Syrian soil, and a place for IDPs from other parts of Syria to
go.

Third, the window for establishing a healthy relationship with the emerging rebel leadership in the north is
now very much open, but won't be forever. A while back, when they were advancing in Aleppo, the rebels
were feeling that they could win on their own. They realize now, in part because of the regime's use of air
power, that it won't be that easy, and that they need help. At the same time -- indeed, as a result -- anti-
American sentiment is growing, much more now than at the start of the uprising. One of our folks
reports: "We could feel this in all our meetings with them over the last weeks. When we were talking to the
head of the Revolutionary Council in Northern Aleppo about the Geneva Conventions, he cut us off, saying
'don't come here offering us your western values after you haven't done anything to help us." We were still
able eventually to get on more reasonable grounds with this commander, and others —these guys are still
willing to listen and to learn, in part because they still haven't given up on western support. But any hope of
persuading them on this or other issues we all care about will diminish if help is not forthcoming; they'll listen
more to the Saudis and Qataris, and, yes, to the jihadis. BTW, our team reports that the jihadi influence is
minimal for now —the FSA is using them "because they are crazy fighters," but they agree with the general
assessment that the longer this goes on, the stronger radical forces will become.

My own sense is that nothing would more effectively establish American and international support for the
opposition, and the influence that will bring, than a no-fly zone. You can send in all the comms equipment, or
guns and ammo, in the world, and still not get credit, given the hands that stuff passes through — not to
mention that you can't control where it all goes. Planes in the sky, as we saw in Libya, would send a
dramatically stronger signal (in addition to tangible force), while allowing the Syrian rebels to retain ownership
of their struggle on the ground. This should be accompanied by working with rebel authorities in the
protected area on institution-building, justice, and humanitarian assistance. Whoever will deliver this
combination will have influence over Syria for years to come.

I recognize that the cavalry is not suited up and ready to ride, and that the mission would be far from simple
or cost-free, even if limited to no-fly. But in the meantime, even maintaining a credible threat of action would
have a positive impact. Our team reports that Secretary Clinton's visit to Turkey produced not just hopes on
the rebel side, but also apprehension on the gov't side, including a lull in air attacks (indeed, our folks used this
window to move around more freely). But then the attacks — especially aerial bombing — seemed to spike
again after Secretary Panetta said that a no-fly zone was not on the front burner. Local activists and leaders
we work with were upset — not so much by the substance of this statement (they don't expect immediate
action), but by the fact that he made it publicly, which, they felt, suggested to government forces that they
could carry on.

In conversations with many of you in the last year, you have understandably expressed concern about taking
any dramatic action to intervene in the Syrian crisis without knowing what would come next. I can't chart a
definitive path from the establishment of a no-fly zone to a political transition in Damascus and a stable
Syria. But one might also ask: Could a limited military intervention (in this case more limited than what you
carried out brilliantly in Libya) achieve limited objectives that would do more good than harm in Syria,
consistent with American interests, even if it had to be sustained over time? I think that the answer to that
question is more likely to be "yes" today than it was a few weeks or months ago, because of the evolution in
the conflict described above. A safe zone, protected by grounding Syrian air power, would bring immediate
and tangible benefits for hundreds of thousands of threatened people and secure U.S. influence with the
rebels and in a post-Assad Syria. And every scenario we can imagine for finishing the job — whether an
agreement brokered by the UN or the Russians, or accelerating defections leading to a regime collapse, would
at least be more likely if there were a dramatic shift in the balance of forces on the ground. The alternative is
to hope for the same outcome, but with less chance of success in the foreseeable future, and far greater loss
of life and of U.S. influence over what Syria will become.

Best,


Tom
