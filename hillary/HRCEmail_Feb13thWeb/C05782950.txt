Ran it down. EEB leading effort with Treasury and others. Appears UK has enough info on 3 of 5 to move on sanctions.
More info being sent on 2 others in time for UK meeting at 9am their time Monday. Should be no problem but have
asked that EEB let me know when all info has been passed.

Wendy--

I just spoke w Hague who said UK was awaiting info from our govt so it could move forward w pressing EU sanctions at
the EU Council mtg in a week. Do you know who is handling this request and if we can fulfill it? Obviously would be good
to get strong EU position which Hague suggested would include the designations we made.

Also, I asked him to press Saudis to go to GCC and Arab League and to be more proactive in seeking
condemnation/action v Iran.

All best, H
