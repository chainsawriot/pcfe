Subject:                          Wikileaks



Madame Secretary, we have seen in the past hour release of stories on three outlets — the New York Times, Guardian
and der Spiegel —that summarize military documents about the campaign in Pakistan and Afghanistan. We have had
several meetings and calls anticipating these stories. The good news is that they don't appear to reveal anything that is
not publicly known or understood. Also, the documents detail what occurred between 2006 and 2009, prior to our
revised strategy. So far, no documents originate with the State Department. They are mostly field level reports and of
uncertain veracity, which the media openly acknowledge. The White House answered three questions for the NYT
yesterday — about the difficulty of the campaign, ISI complicity with the Taliban and the potential impact of the leaks —
and just issued a statement condemning the leaks as endangering sources and methods. I anticipate that our greatest
challenge will come tomorrow as the Afghans and Pakistanis react to this. As Judith has mentioned in our conversations
over the past couple of days, on both sides of the border, there will be strong suspicions that this was a deliberate leak.
We have cued up posts overseas with top line points and they are closely monitoring the overseas reaction. In addition,
as we head towards Congressional testimony this week, there will be significant questions about what kind of partner
Pakistan is. Our posture will be that Pakistan has in recent months turned a corner as it understands that the insurgency
is a risk to Pakistan itself, but that more needs to be done. But this will definitely challenge our public posture of
progress made through the strategic dialogue and Kabul Conference. Pat, Rich and I will update you again following an 8
a.m. SVTS.
