MS— here is the final statement.

Readout of Telephone Call Between Secretary Clinton and Pakistani Foreign Minister Khar

This morning, I spoke by telephone with Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar.

I once again reiterated our deepest regrets for the tragic incident in Salala last November. I offered our sincere
condolences to the families of the Pakistani soldiers who lost their lives. Foreign Minister Khar and I
acknowledged the mistakes that resulted in the loss of Pakistani military lives. We are sorry for the losses
suffered by the Pakistani military. We are committed to working closely with Pakistan and Afghanistan to
prevent this from ever happening again.

As I told the former Prime Minister of Pakistan days after the Salala incident, America respects Pakistan's
sovereignty and is committed to working together in pursuit of shared objectives on the basis of mutual interests
and mutual respect.

In today's phone call, Foreign Minister Khar and I talked about the importance of taking coordinated action
against terrorists who threaten Pakistan, the United States and the region; of supporting Afghanistan's security,
stability and efforts towards reconciliation; and of continuing to work together to advance the many other
shared interests we have, from increasing trade and investment to strengthening our people-to-people ties. Our

countries should have a relationship that is enduring, strategic and carefully defined and that enhances the
security and prosperity of both our nations and the region.

The Foreign Minister and I were reminded that our troops — Pakistani and American — are in a fight against a
common enemy. We are both sorry for losses suffered by both our countries in this fight against terrorists. We
have enhanced our counter-terrorism cooperation against terrorists that threaten Pakistan and the United States,
with the goal of defeating Al-Qaida in the region.

In addition, I am pleased that Foreign Minister Khar has informed me that the ground supply lines (GLOC) into
Afghanistan are opening. Pakistan will continue not to charge any transit fee in the larger interest of peace and
security in Afghanistan and the region. This is a tangible demonstration of Pakistan's support for a secure,
peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan and our shared objectives in the region. This will also help the U.S. and
ISAF conduct the planned drawdown at a much lower cost. This is critically important to the men and women
who are fighting terrorism and extremism in Afghanistan. Foreign Minister Khar has informed me that
consistent with current practice no lethal equipment will transit the GLOC into Afghanistan except for
equipping the ANSF. In concluding the call, I reiterated our deep appreciation to the Government and the
people of Pakistan for their many sacrifices and their critical contribution to the ongoing fight against terrorism
and extremism.
