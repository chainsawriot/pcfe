For your situational awareness, the USG is taking considerable criticism for this today. Twitter CEO likened the action to
crackdowns in China. He said that Twitter would "lash out" at anything that prevented them from their mission of
"connecting people to useful information."

LONDON (AP) â€” U.S. officials have issued a subpoena to demand details about WikiLeaks' Twitter account,
the group announced January 8, adding that it suspected other American Internet companies were also being
ordered to hand over information about its activities. A copy of the court order, dated Dec. 14 and posted to
Salon.com, said the information sought was "relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation" and ordered Twitter
not to disclose its existence to Assange or any of the others targeted. The order was unsealed "thanks to legal
action by Twitter," WikiLeaks said. Others named in the order include Pfc. Bradley Manning and Birgitta
Jonsdottir, an Icelandic lawmaker and one-time WikiLeaks collaborator. The U.S. is also seeking details about
Dutch hacker Rop Gonggrijp and U.S. programmer Jacob Appelbaum, both of whom have previously worked
with WikiLeaks.
