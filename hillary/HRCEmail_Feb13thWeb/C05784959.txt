Subject: Arab League Approves Sanctions Against Syria (SBU)

(SBU) The approved sanctions include a ban on flights to and from Syria, a travel ban on top Syrian officials,
freezing assets related to President Asad's government, halting financial dealings with Syria's central bank, and
stopping investments in Syria, according to press. Iraq, Lebanon, and Algeria voted against the measure.
Embassy Cairo comments it is not yet clear when these sanctions go into effect.
