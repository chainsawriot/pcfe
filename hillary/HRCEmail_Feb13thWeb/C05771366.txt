Hi Frank

Less to this than meets the eye. I just said that 2014 was a goal not a guarantee and that the Nato mission would continue thereafter,
focused on training etc. But inevitably some of the more excitable journalists decided that I was predicting combat for years.

Mark,

I am travelling with Secretary Clinton and read a statement in the press attributed to you that characterized 2014 as an inflection point
for transition to Afghan security forces lead, and that full transition could go beyond 2014. I had not heard that formulation before. I
assume it was mis-reported, but wonder if you could clarify.

Much appreciated
