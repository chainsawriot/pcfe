25, where they plan to review the way ahead post-Doha.

I asked Erekat about today's AP report, in which he is quoted as saying that the Pals will go to UNGA, and that the timing
will be decided in Doha. Erekat said the report is a mischaracterization, and that he told the journalist that the substance
and timing of an UNGA approach will be discussed in Doha. The journalist reportedly pressed him, "But when will the
decision be made? Will you decide the timing in Doha?," to which Erekat said he replied, "maybe."
