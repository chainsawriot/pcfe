Forgot to add you both. Pls follow up w invites. And, Lona, I will need at least a half hour for my part and may want to
leave the others to continue.

Gary,

I'm looking forward to seeing you too,

For the substantive discussion, I'd like to invite the first ever State Dept Economist and the head of our first ever Energy
Bureau along w our economic team from Policy Planning to discuss the economic and energy issues you are raising.

One of my missions has been to help better coordinate all aspects of our international economic and energy policies
across the whole government. I think the global reach of State's presence can assist other agencies in meeting their own
objectives.

I'm copying Lona and Jake to coordinate attendance on our side.
All the best, H

Hillary,

I look forward to catching up with you when we see each other this coming Tuesday.



On the work front, if it is of interest, I would be glad to share with you my current thoughts on European economic and
financial challenges; and a brief update on what we have been doing over at the CFTC with regards to financial reform as
well as what we have been doing to coordinate reforms internationally.

In a nutshell, on. Europe, though Mario Draghi and the ECB have relieved considerable pressure from the banking and
financial sector by injecting 1 Trillion Euros of 3 year loans into the European banking sector and Greece has recently
restructured its debt, I remain concerned about the long term viability of the monetary union. The steps forward in the
direction of more centralized fiscal discipline, in my opinion, still do not address the fundamental challenges of
comparative competitive capabilities across a common currency union. Given the realities of politics, culture and
language, the free flow of labor and fiscal transfers are not likely to be significant enough to relieve the pressures that
have already built within the Euro zone and surely will be exacerbated over time from different growth rates across
Europe. As a point of reference, when East and West Germany were unified and adopted a common currency, it took

the migration of millions of Germans to the West and transfer of 100s of billions of DMarks to the East to help stabilize
their economy. The result has been largely successful, but only after many years and only based upon a common
culture, language and heritage. In comparison, Euro zone migration and fiscal transfers are likely to be limited as
measured in relation to their overall economy. Thus, I fear that the less competitive parts of Europe are likely to be
shackled with high unemployment rates for many years and be challenged by attendant social and political unrest.

I have a better view on the International coordination with regard to financial reform as it relates to the OTC derivatives
markets. Admittedly, it is a far easier challenge. With the passage of Dodd Frank, The CFTC, SEC, Treasury and the Fed
have been coordinating with our European and Asian partners for several years to bring about as similar reform as
possible. Europe is on the cusp of finalizing their legislative package (so-called 'EMIR') for much of the 2009 G-20
commitment in this area. (central clearing, data reporting and higher capital charges) The rest of the package (public
transparency of trading) is being considered by the European Parliament and possibly will be enacted early next
year. (in so-called 'MiFir' and 'MiFid') I just had a trip to Basel and Brussels last week on which I can brief you if it is of
interest. At the CFTC we have proposed our full set of Dodd Frank rules and have finalized about half of the needed
reforms. Our expectation is to finalize the remaining rules this year.



                                   I attach it for you if interested.

Again, I look forward to seeing you later this week.

Gary
