Subject: Further thoughts on QDDR

After some more thinking and conversation today I have another suggestion for the link b/w diplomacy and
development on the QDDR. Suppose we say that the point is to elevate both diplomacy and development relative to
defense and thus to look at how development can strenthen our diplomacy and how the tools of diplomacy (direct
negotiations w/ govts, work thru international and regional organizations, tools of 21st century statecraft) can
strengthen development. If we emphasize the tools of diplomacy it is more tied to resources -- eg what we fund and
develop and what we don't.

I think that w/ that formulation jack has to be a leader and S/P is his natural partner given that this is really a policy
planning exercise w/ very big implications for how we allocate our resources. If I co-lead I can also make sure that we
keep pushing the ball forward by convening meetings when jack is inevitably swamped w/ more operational issues.
Best,
AM
