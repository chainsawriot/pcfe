Noises of resolve w/out greater success on the ground v Q's forces will not sound convincing. Who's coordinating the
parallel military discussion about what more will be done by whom?

FYI.

After some back and forth on the below, we will use UK draft on principles as a coordinating tool for a small group (such
as US-UK-Qatar-Fr-Italy-Turkey-UN), and reflect only the broad outlines in co-chair's statement.          concern abc1 .4(B)
an overall message of resolve is important.                                                                           1.4(D)
