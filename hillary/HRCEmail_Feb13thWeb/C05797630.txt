Understand sensitivity -- while we sort that out with WH, let's send Charge now. Wendy reminded me that Roberta has
suggested several good names.

I have been trying delicately to change that with obvious understanding for the political sensitivity.

Cheryl and Bill,
In my weekly meeting with Roberta, we both realized that we did not know where things are regarding a Charges or
COM for El Salvador. Have any final decisions been taken? I assume even if COM is not yet resolved that we want to
send a charges. Appreciate any update. Thanks.
Wendy
