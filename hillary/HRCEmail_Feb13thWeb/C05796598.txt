Background on Rohingya in Burma: Approximately 800,000 predominantly Muslim Rohingya live in
northern Rakhine State near the Burma-Bangladesh border. Citing restrictive citizenship laws, Burma
denies the Rohingya citizenship, rendering them stateless. The Rohingya experience severe legal,
economic, and social discrimination. The government limits their ability to travel, marry, study and
work. Perhaps as many as 1.5 million Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia,
Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand. Clashes in June between Buddhist Rakhines and Muslim Rohingya
left at least 78 people dead and tens of thousands displaced.

In response to press coverage of Thein Sein's remarks, a UNHCR spokeswoman said: "There are no
ground for us to set up refugee camps inside a country where they are supposed to be citizens."

Thanks in advance for your help!

Subject: UN refugee chief rejects call to resettle Rohingya (AP)

YANGON, Myanmar - (AP) A U.N. official has rejected a suggestion by Myanmar's president that the world refugee
agency resettle or take care of ethnic Rohingyas who live in the Southeast Asian country.
  U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres told reporters Thursday it was not his agency's job.
  Myanmar denies citizenship to the Rohingya and considers them illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Some have lived
there generations.
  President Them n Sein's website said he told Guterres in a meeting Wednesday that the solution to ethnic enmity in
Myanmar's western Rakhine state was to either send the Rohingya to a third country or have the UNHCR look after
them.
