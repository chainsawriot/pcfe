Subject: Senator Mitchell's conversation with FM Moratinos

Dear All,
Senator Mitchell asked that I share the message below regarding the conversation he had with FM Moratinos this
afternoon.
Thanks,
Julia

From Senator Mitchell:
Moratinos said he talked with with Abbas and Erakat (and will see them in Amman on Tuesday; he thinks the meeting in
Brussels tomorrow will last only one day)

                                                                                                                           B1
                                                                                                                           1.4(B)
       I told him that I would report to you and get back to him; he requested that the Secretary call Ashton; I said I
                                                                                                                           1.4(D)
would pass along the request (Note: S has spoken with Ashton at this point).
