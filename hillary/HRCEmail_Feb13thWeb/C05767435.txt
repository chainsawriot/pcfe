RCH — A quick recap of a very busy Tues:

        Af/Pak Roll-Out. The meeting at the WH went very well. I arranged with Ben Rhodes to be invited, as well as
        Vikram. Verma and Turk also attended from State. We played a key role there; in fact, Denis and Ben asked us
        to kick off the conversation, so we detailed our ideas on outreach to allies at the outset, which were very well-
        received, including by Tien. We deferred to Rich and the WH re Hill strategy, but then also made a number of
        suggestions for outreach to media and opinion leaders. WH asked us for our draft plan, which they suggested
        would become the basis for the roll-out.                                                                              B5




                                                                       We also discussed the optics of presenting this as a
        joint civ-mil strategy, and not just as a troops decision. At the end of the meeting, WH said they would take our
        inputs as well as any by DOD and others, and start aggregating all suggested calls and meetings into one
        centralized database. They plan for several follow-up meetings of this core group before the
        announcement.




        China planning. I was in touch with Dave Shear today on this, and our team worked with the China desk on
        pushing this proposal forward. Shear spoke with the Chinese, and thought there were positive signs that this
        could happen in Beijing before the POTUS visit. He will be meeting with the Chinese DCM tomorrow about this
        and other issues. The Chinese MFA formally replied to our invitation for two days of technical Af/Pak
        consultations with a counter-proposal for one day of meetings that are quite general —

-    South Korea. ROK had sought our help over the past few days in getting a formal invitation from the Afghan
     government to ROK for the PRT, in all likelihood so that ROK could announce this during the POTUS visit. We
     have been working with Embassy on this, and learned tonight that Emb had successfully been in touch with the
     Foreign Ministry, and the ROK received what they needed. ROK was in touch with us to offer thanks.

- LeT Arrests. I attended a meeting called by Cheryl and Jim on this before the documents were unsealed by
    DO.J. Per my earlier email on the subject, we are referring all press inquiries to Dal.

                                                                                                                        B7(A)
                                                                                                                        B7(E)




-    Trafficking Story.




                      The quote CdeBaca ultimately gave to Time, posted immediately, was "Debt bondage is not a relic
      of history; it continues to exist in communities in South Asia. We are exploring ways we can help Pakistan to
      confront the scourge of captive workers, to deliver freedom for these workers and realize the promise of
      Pakistan's 1992 Emancipation law."

-     OSCE Summit. I spoke with Phil about this, and told him that we didn't want to foreclose any options before this
      was discussed at a higher level. He agreed, and said he would gauge WH interest in some sort of Afghanistan-
      focused summit hosted by Kazakhstan, and would also ask Moscow for its views.

-     Defense Authorization Act. POTUS will sign this on Wednesday, delivering brief remarks, and be joined by
      SecDef and Members of Congress. This may or may not trigger some additional news coverage in Pakistan.

-     IRI. I spoke with Lorne. IRI is planning on sending 8-10 people to Kabul for the second round, primarily to
      observe the counting process. NDI will also organize something for the second round, but Lorne thought it
      would focus more on Afghans reporting from the field. Lorne would also like to come in next week with Ken to
      meet with you about funding more democratization programs in Pakistan, including through KLB money. He and
      Ken are having lunch tomorrow, and I told him that if they each wanted to send me a brief (1-2 pg) proposal, I'd
      be happy to circulate it, including to Robin, whom Ken had previously reached out to.

-     Civilian Surge. I spoke with Jack about his concerns that we are continuing to get hammered by the civilian
      surge story,
                                                                      He's meeting with Reps Lowey and Granger about
      this this week, and he tied this story into others as well, including (a) Matt Hoh story (which we worked with him
      on TPs about); (b) broader concerns about role of USAID expressed by Lugar and others (Jack will be meeting
      with him this week); (c) procurement issues, etc, and the ongoing briefings on those (I'm doing another one
      tomorrow for Senate); and (d) casualties. In short, Jack wants us to take the lead on figuring out a much more
      robust communications/Hill strategy on these issues, whether that involves more/different briefings; media

        appearances (Sunday shows, etc); targeted op-eds, etc. He also said we should think about using something like
        the Vilsack trip to flag the role of civilians, and perhaps include reporters on that plane. Vikram et al will work
        this.

    - Ag. Given conversations with both Jack and Verma, we need to be careful about how we portray the Ag/USAID
        relationship,




    - Trip to Pak. And, lastly, it seems that Derek's trip to Pakistan has now been postponed due to Embassy
         constraints, so I'll likely be here next week after all thootah I had told him that I'd like to PO with him 7e may
         take the trip in Dec/Jan instead, with Sham ila,

Hope all's well with the trip thus far.

Dan
