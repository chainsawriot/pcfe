Wendy--

I just spoke w Hague who said UK was awaiting info from our govt so it could move forward w pressing EU sanctions at
the EU Council mtg in a week. Do you know who is handling this request and if we can fulfill it? Obviously would be good
to get strong EU position which Hague suggested would include the designations we made.

Also, I asked him to press Saudis to go to GCC and Arab League and to be more proactive in seeking
condemnation/action v Iran.

All best, H
