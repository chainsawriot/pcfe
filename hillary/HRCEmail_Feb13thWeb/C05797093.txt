space.

My recommendation for their notional schedule is:

0900 Personnel with cdm/jjs

1000 Meeting with Bill

1045am Meeting with H on confirmation matters

1200 Lunch with some subgorup of FPAB

1400 Regional Bureau briefing (NEA)

1530 Regional Bureau briefing (SRAP)

1700 Wrap UP

Any thoughts/concerns? Going to have John Bass coordinate.
