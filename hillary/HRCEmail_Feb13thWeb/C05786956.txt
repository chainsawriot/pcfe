Cheryl,
                                                                                                      B1
I took a call around noon from Dieuseul Valcin who asked that I schedule a meeting with him, youi 4(DI
and me this Friday afternoon to talk about a $30-$35 billion dollar oil refinery that the Saudis want Id
build in Haiti to service the U.S. market. He said he represents a French Company involved in this
PFC; SA




Valcin said he was of Haitian Origin, did not work for PEG, SA, but was helping them with this refinery
project.

Krish found the attached link on Google, citing PEG SA's man in Haiti, Marc Antoine Destin (an
apparent Haitian Presidential candidate in 2005):

I told Mr. Valcin that I would get back to him. Do you know anything about this, want to meet with
this guy or should I offer to meet with him alone? If any addressees know anything about this, please
let me know.

Tom
