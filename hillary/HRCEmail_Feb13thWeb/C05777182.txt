When I told Nancy that the fees were left out of the rule, she said she was surprised and would ask what happened
because "they were looking out for you." She also said she was sure they were in since she wanted to tell Conrad and
the Senate to go forward. So, who knows.

Berman went to the leadership meeting yesterday to make his case for fees - that's what they must be referring to. It
was after that meeting that the blue dogs and hoyer told him no.

Copying Rich -- I cannot explain. He was with us until 6 pm yesterday when he reached the conclusion that it would
bring down the rule.

She and George Miller were adamant so what could they mean? They said Berman pushed it thru.

Just got an email from S saying that Pelosi just told her fees are in. Can we check the actual conf rept to let her know for
sure if this is correct or not. I responded that we understood they were out but would check. Thx
