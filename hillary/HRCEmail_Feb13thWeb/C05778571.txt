Subject: GCC Peninsula Shield Force Enters Bahrain (SBU)

(SBU) Embassy Manama reports the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Peninsula Shield Force, currently including only
Saudi elements, departed King Khalid Military City in northeast Saudi Arabia along with the Third Riot Control Battalion of
the Saudi Arabia National Guard and are now crossing the King Fahd causeway into Bahrain. Consulate General
Dhahran confirms the causeway is now closed to regular traffic and adds some trucks are moving across but post does
not yet have the composition details of the GCC elements. In response to reports of possible GCC intervention in
Bahrain's domestic situation, the Bahraini opposition groups including the largest Shiite party Wefaq said any intervention
by Gulf Arab forces in Bahrain is a declaration of war and occupation. Embassy Manama confirms the Bahrain
International Airport is still open and operating. Post notes Assistant Secretary Feltman's scheduled arrival at 1545
Manama/0845 EDT would not be affected.
