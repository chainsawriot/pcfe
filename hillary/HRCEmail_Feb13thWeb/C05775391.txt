See notes below from yesterday's meeting with DoD.




I strongly recommend that we focus all our efforts on immediately strengthening State's capacity in this area. Starting
this week the PD/DAS's in NEA, EUR and AF will begin daily conference calls with the PAO's in their regions to track what
is going on in all critical countries and to ensure that we rapidly respond to attacks and mis-information. We are also
developing a strategy to push out the "positive" stories about all we are doing.




As a first step in the process, yesterday we directed all posts to push a response to the Uganda bombing focusing on the
attacks, less from a US perspective, and more on the attacks on innocent soccer fans celebrating Africa's shining
moment as host of the World Cup. As part of that approach, one person from AF/PD suggested reaching out to FIFA to
get them to issue a statement condemning the attacks.




A key factor in our ability to do all this will be to ensure that we have the right people in the right places. This is no easy
task in a system which rewards longevity over performance. I will have a proposal for a proposed solution to this
challenge for your review later this week and no doubt will need your support to push it through.




In terms of the interagency, we should take advantage of Panetta's offer and figure out a way to work with the IC on CVE
related issues. At the same time, we can continue the other inter-agency discussions.Hopefully our position in those
discussions will be strengthened once we can demonstrate our capacity to pull this off.
