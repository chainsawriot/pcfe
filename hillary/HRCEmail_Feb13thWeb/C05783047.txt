Obama to decide Keystone XL project
By: Dan Berman
November 1, 2011 06:26 PM EDT
President Barack Obama indicated Tuesday hell be making the final call on the proposed
Keystone XL oil pipeline that would run from Alberta to Texas.

In an interview with Omaha, Neb., station KETV, Obama said the State Department —
which was expected to make the decision on the pipeline — will instead deliver
recommendations to the White House on the proposal.

Obama said he will then consider a variety of factors, including environmental concerns,
public health, jobs and energy independence, before making a decision.

"The State Department's in charge of analyzing this, because there's a pipeline coming in
from Canada," Obama told KETV's Rob McCartney in the White House. "They'll be giving
me a report over the next several months, and, you know, my general attitude is, what is
best for the American people? What's best for our economy both short term and long
term? But also, what's best for the health of the American people? Because we don't want

for examples aquifers, they're adversely affected, folks in Nebraska obviously would be
directly impacted, and so we want to make sure we're taking the long view on these
issues.

"We need to encourage domestic oil and natural gas production," Obama added. "We
need to make sure that we have energy security and aren't just relying on Middle East
sources. But there's a way of doing that and still making sure that the health and safety of
the American people and folks in Nebraska are protected, and that's how I'll be measuring
these recommendations when they come to me."

McCartney asked Obama if the promise of job growth will affect his decision.

"It does, but I think folks in Nebraska like all across the country aren't going to say to
themselves, 'We'll take a few thousand jobs if it means that our kids are potentially
drinking water that would damage their health or rich land that's so important to agriculture
in Nebraska are being adversely affected," Obama said, adding, "because those create
jobs, and you know when somebody gets sick that's a cost that the society has to bear as
well. So these are all things that you have to take a look at when you make these
decisions."

On Monday, White House press secretary Jay Carney had answered a question on the
Keystone project by stating "the fact that this is a decision that will be made by the State
Department, or is housed within the State Department."

Carney's statement led to headlines in the D.C. media such as: "Carney distances Obama
from looming Keystone pipeline decision" and "White House washes its hands of
Keystone XL decision."
