Jake,
Johnnie and I spoke and we all now agree that we should suspend assistance and have Toria say so from podium
today. Maria checked with L and there is no formal determination needed. If 5/7th floor are agreed, Toria can
announce. Please affirm by way of this email that Toria can do so. Thanks very much.
Wendy
