We have 3 $1 million donors: Caterpillar, Citigroup and Coca Cola; and
$100,000 from Motorola Solutions and USCET. Coke is new (2 mins ago!) Can we make sure S knows this in case she
wants to thank them? Thanks!

Carola, sorry for the late notice. I just heard that Coca-Cola has approved a $1 million gift for the 100,000 Strong
initiative, and Muhtar Kent or Clyde Tuggle will inform State of this decision at the lunch today or State dinner this
evening. Would it be possible for coca-cola to be added to press about the initiative in conjunction with the visit?
Thanks very much for working with us on this. all best, amy

Got it. We are sending back edits to the FLOTUS press release, but I am sure we can add an extra $1 million if Coke
comes through by the end of the day! Thanks for your help.

in response to my request for update. if I hear anything will let you know.
