and I feel VERY blessed. And still receiving continual bouquets of praise on your behalfâ€”everyone of every description
tells me how much they appreciate the job you are doing for the country. It's actually very heartening to hear,
particularly across the political divide.
All best,
AM

Please let me know if any of this resonates, if you want to use any of it great, but if not, I really
want to write it myself as an op-ed or couple of posts.
