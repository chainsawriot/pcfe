European and Canadian Sanctions on Iran




    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770717 Date: 02/13/2016

The United States welcomes the strong steps taken by our European and Canadian partners to implement UN Security
Council Resolution 1929. Consistent with the Security Council's mandate, these measures go beyond the provisions of
Resolution 1929 and impose additional sanctions against Iran's financial, insurance, transportation, trade and energy
sectors, as well as the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. The new measures contain important restrictions on Iran's
ability to support its nuclear and missile programs through energy proceeds and its transportation network. The strong
restrictions and prohibitions on Iran's ability to access Canada's and Europe's commercial and banking systems
significantly increase Iran's isolation from the international financial system. These steps underscore the steadfast
European and Canadian leadership in holding Iran accountable to its international obligations.

These measures, combined with the new and existing U.S. sanctions, underscore the international community's
deepening concerns about Iran's nuclear program and refusal to live up to its international responsibilities and set a high
standard for global implementation of sanctions. We have already begun to see their impact, as companies around the
world refuse to do business with Iran rather than risk becoming involved in Iran's nuclear program and other illicit
activities.

Moving forward, the United States will continue to work with the European Union, Canada, and our allies and partners
around the world to put additional pressure on Iran and ensure that existing sanctions are vigorously enforced. The
message to Iran's leaders is clear: Meet your responsibilities or face increasing isolation and consequences.

We applaud the EU and Canada for these decisive actions, but regret their necessity. The United States remains
committed to a diplomatic solution that resolves the international community's concerns regarding Iran's nuclear
program. We will continue to work with the European Union, Canada, the P5+1 and all of our partners to pursue our
dual track approach of engagement and pressure to achieve this objective. We once again urge Iran's leaders to pursue
a path of cooperation and responsibility rather than confrontation and further isolation.
