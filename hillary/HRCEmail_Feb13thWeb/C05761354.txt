Hello all:
Just a heads up — earlier today, the WH notified Congress that Eric Goosby will be nominated for the position of Global
AIDS Coordinator. The official announcement will be made on Monday, but the news is largely out and in the
community, with Representative Barbara Lee already doing a release. I know that the WH is coordinating with Speaker
to save her official release for Monday, and I think it's good for us to wait until it's completely official to announce as
well, but wanted to give heads up that people will likely be getting press questions about this.
Thanks,
Ann

Great — we actually will want to do a bit of press around Eric                             — can it be held until Monday   B5
to prep?

Adding Ann, Jake and Philippe/Pi who should get prepared.
