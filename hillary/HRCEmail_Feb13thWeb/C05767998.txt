Jake,

FYI — I have just returned from a meeting at DOI. This was a scheduled meeting with Tom Strickland (A/S for
Fish/Wildlife and National Park Service) to discuss our efforts on many topics — e.g. CITES, Biodiversity, etc. Tom
brought Sec. Salazar in to meet us and discuss a few topics. There are two issues you should know about:

       1) Arctic — Sec Salazar plans to join S in Canada next week at the Arctic-5 meeting. (He is still very interested in
          engaging in the Arctic and does not seem to be a big fan of the Arctic Council — suggesting it is too low level.
          ) Regarding the meeting in Canada, we are looking for a role for Sec Salazar and think the best issue for him
          might be the outer continental shelf. We are going to check into this based on the current meeting agenda.

       2) Sec Salazar is interested in pursuing a "peace park" linking Big Ben National Park in Texas to land in
          Mexico. From our discussion it seems that the land in Mexico is not yet owned by the government. Sec Salazar
          indicated that he has had discussions with the NSC about this, specifically in terms of President Calderon's visit
          in May and the state dinner. He suggested that this would be a subject of discussion during the visit. He is
          already planning meetings with DHS on this topic. (We are tracking down more details on the potential park.)

I am passing this on to you as Sec Salazar mentioned that he would be discussing the park and the upcoming Arctic
meeting with S soon.

Best Regards,
Kern-Ann
