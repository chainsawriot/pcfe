Cable to follow, but given interest a low-side initial readout:

I saw Egyptian Amb Auf today. His assessment very upbeat: Positive press coverage reflects substance of
meetings. SAG chose to engage with Morsi as President of Egypt, not MB figure. Most meetings were just Amb, Morsi,
FM and EGIS chief. They talked prisoners; SAG will release some in Ramadan. They talked investment and trade; Saudi
Trade minister will go after Ramadan to Egypt, both sides highlighted importance of resolving trade disputes and
clearing the way for more investment opportunities. Morsi emphasized non-interference in internal affairs, standing
with Saudi and the Gulf in the face of Iran, deep respect for the Kingdom as reflected in choosing to come to Saudi on
first overseas trip. Meeting with CP Sa!man focused mostly on econ issues, again very positive. Egypt and Saudi as twin
pillars of the Arab world, when they agree all will follow. Importance of relationship affirmed all around, groundwork
laid for strong future ties that will be demonstrated in a slew of post-Eid bilateral visits. Asked about financial
assistance, Auf simply said the Saudis have delivered fully on their promises to date.

Morsi also met with Egyptian citizens here, they are demanding a parliamentarian be specially elected to represent
them, also want customs and educational concessions. Morsi (who is popular with Egyptian expats here) enjoyed the
meeting, which went well — real constituency politics in action, something he seemed to enjoy.

Our Pol section went over to MFA today to see Arab Affairs Director (I'll see Deputy FM Prince Abdulaziz bin Abdullah
tomorrow in Jeddah — he was in the meetings with Morsi (and with Abu Mazen)). MFA official said this was more of a
get to know you meeting than anything else. Egyptians asked for more money/financial support —Saudi response on
this, as in much else was "we'll wait and see."                                                                         'B1
not necessarily a successful pitch.) Generally positive meetings, but                                                    1.4(D)
                n added layer of potential problems. Nothing wrong with the visit so much as nothing particularly right
about eitrie. Protocol and honor were served on all sides, but how much upside there is to this relationship depends
on what Mors' does....

That's the initial snap-shot from here. Saudi line does seem to have switched a bit from                                B1
(which was very much where Naif was, and other senior Saudis as well) to a more guarded/nuanced,                        1.4(D)
                                there seems to be some emergent faith that now in government Morsi will have to tack
more pragmatic and less ideological, though the Saudis are cautious and will likely play a bit of a wait and see
game. There is considerable                                              although whether that's                 Dr not
is a different matter.

More once I talk to AAA.

I will say that Morsi took the unusual step after his mtg with the king to say how good the meeting was, and that cp
salman confirmed that this was the case. Everyone at pains to present correct public image. Won't know the backstory
until I can get in to see Deputy FM, who was in the mtg...
