military operations have gone beyond whatthe Arab League backed.               Moussa has told reporters Sunday that
"what happened differsfrom the no-fly zone objectives." He says "what we want iscivilians' protection not shelling more
civilians."        U.S. and European strikes overnight targeted mainl Jeffrey Feltman
