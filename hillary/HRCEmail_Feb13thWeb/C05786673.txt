Subject: 50th Anniversary event on November 3rd

Cheryl,

Raj told me that the Secretary was willing to ask the President if he would attend our 50th Anniversary celebration on
morning of November 3rd.

I have attached the invitation that we sent out.
Below it is the anticipated run of show for the event.
Obviously we would revamp event to accommodate the President's schedule.

Thanks so much for helping us make the 50th event memorable.

Margie
