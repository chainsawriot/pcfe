(SBU) Embassy Kabul notes press accounts of the Taliban claiming responsibility are unconfirmed, but that it does
appear to have been a suicide attack. Initial unconfirmed reports indicate between five and ten DoD personnel were
killed. The Embassy is finalizing accountability for Chief of Mission personnel, but does not believe COM personnel were
involved. The Embassy has cancelled all movements to the area of the attack for today.

American military personnel or Department of Defense civilians.
