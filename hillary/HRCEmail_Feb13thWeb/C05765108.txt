Congressional Issues

    *   Rich flagged that the climate bill was supposed to be marked up starting today, but the Republicans were
        rumored no shows. Health care is stalled in the House because of abortion provisions; they were taking 72
        hours to work it and that meant the House discussion may not start this week.

    *    Senate was looking at more cloture votes for next week (Arturo?). Rich was going to take Tom Shannon up to
         see DeMint



    •    Some discussion of what the strategy was on               omination;

Public Affairs

    O   Ian said he would follow up explaining the programs the Secretary had announced in Marrakesh and thought
        that Iran should not be such big news, but her statements on Iran were useful.

Legal Issues

    *    Harold flagged that Karadzic was showing up now at ICTY; highlighted that the Uighurs are doing well in Palau



Deputy Secretaries Meeting Highlights

EU Meetings

    •   Phil confirmed that yes, the EU was good to go forward with Jim chairing tomorrow's events and a possible
        Secretary phone call in to the meeting at the top which he said he had run by Huma.

10 Issues

    •    Esther said the GA resolution on Goldstone wasn't as drastic as it could have been, though it still crossed our
         redlines; New York was working it. Austria is the November UNSC chair and their theme for the month will be
         protection of civilians. She also highlighted discussion in the Security Council about a statement welcoming
         Afghanistan's elections results; Jim said NY reps seemed disconnected from capitals since most capitals had
         independently welcomed the results already, so he didn't understand why it would be controversial at all.



    •    Esther said El Baradei's farewell speech was pretty neutral in tone about Iran — he had said they needed to
         provide clarification.

GTMO Detainees

    O    Dan F highlighted the Uighurs, who are going with the Palawan President to his favorite scuba diving spot; said



                  He is ott to Slovakia tonight.

Sri Lanka

    •    Bob B flagged that                                                                                             B3 INA

                    The information could have domestic political implications in Sri Lanka.

    •    Jim noted the EU was not shy about explicitly linking Sri Lankan IDPs to EU trade preferences.                    B5


Africa Issues

    •    Johnnie Carson flagged that a senior-level Ethiopian delegation will be in town Thursday to review bilateral
         relations; Jim will participate,

    •    Johnnie also highlighted thE             ssues.



WHA Issues

    •    WHA noted Craig Kelly is en route to Honduras with Labor Secretary Solis and an OAS / Latin delegation.

    •    Southcom is hosting a COM conference with our Caribbean and Latin posts to talk regional security.

    •    The Mexicans are hosting a meeting on Haiti and ways to stabilize further the situation there; we're
         represented. (NFI — I'm following up with WHA on this.)
