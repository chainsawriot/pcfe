Subject: Israeli demarche on Jerusalem statements

Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren called me today to complain about our comments today on the Jerusalem
housing evictions. Saying that he was calling under instructions, he made comments on three basic themes:

1) The evictions of the Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah were purely a legal matter. These were illegal
squatters. The case went all through the Israeli court system and was decided by the Supreme Court. This
was not a provocation. If there was a provocation, it was when the illegal squatters stopped paying their rent.

2) Israel objects to the suggestion that this was a violation of the roadmap. Israel requests clarification of
what part of the roadmap obligations the U.S. believes were violated.

3) Israel rejects the suggestion that the timing was connected to the Fatah Party Congress. There is no
connection.

I undertook to convey the demarche and made our response about how this really is unhelpful, especially at
this time.
