Yes I will do tonight along w Egyptian PM and FM.
Could you work w Monica to get them scheduled?
I'm copying Monica.

But, Mbeki has been difficult to schedule. Pls see if Johnnie can help.

Also, I do not want to call Lavrov to discuss the Berengia park since I would have to raise other matters. How about a
letter?

I think we're good for now. But depending on how this plays out, Krishna may reach out to S.

Geoff,
I think we are good for today between your work with Arun all day, my call to Rao,
let Jake know if you think any need for S call to FM given time zone differences in Africa. Thanks very much.
Wendy
