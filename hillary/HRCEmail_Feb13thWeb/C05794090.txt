UN's Commission on the Status of Women.

It's held every year for 2 weeks from end of Feb to beginning of March.

Melanne and Susan Rice will co-lead the U.S. delegation. Each year we select public delegates to accompany the
delegation.

Here is the final list, including WH's suggestions that Melanne is okay with moving forward.

Let me know if you have any concerns before I reach out to the top three.
