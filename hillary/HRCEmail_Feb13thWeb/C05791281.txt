Here is the link to the HQN legislation the House will be voting on tomorrow:
http://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20120716/BILLS-112s1959-SUS.xml

This version includes a Sense of Congress, unlike the Senate-passed Burr bill, that 1) HQN
meets the criteria for designation and 2) the Secretary should designate HQN as an FTO. And
that Sense of Congress language is stronger than the original offered by Rogers/IRL/McKeon,
but is not as strong as Feinstein's language. We expect this to pass.

H is trying to get a copy of the Burr legislation that the House is scheduled to consider tomorrow.

On the Feinstein legislation, it was introduced but there hasn't been any other movement yet. H has not heard
that it has been amended from "shall" to "should." Our sense is that this legislation won't move.

Correct. The language would require S to issue a report on whether HQN meets the criteria for designation, but would not compel her
to designate. The Rogers language is the same as Burr's except that it included a non-binding "sense of Congress" statement that S
should designate. In order to get the legislation through the House, Rogers will likely drop the "sense of Congress." I'm not sure
where the Feinstein language stands. I understand that DoJ is examining whether her language, which compels S to designate, is
constitutional.

The desk and H sent in a very good Note on this on Friday. From what I understand, this is likely to be the Burr language, amended to
be very close to the Rogers language, and would not require S to designate. It may very well be a different revision though, so H and
Amy, please chime in.

Thanks,
Kate

H team -- I heard from a House staffer over the wknd that the Haqqani designation legislation was back on the House schedule for
Tuesday. The notice evidently says "Burr as amended." I'm not sure how the Burr language may have changed (is it still distinct from
the Rogers bill, and what's the status of that?), but can you try to get some clarity for us early on Mon? Would this require that S
designate? And if so, is it constitutional? And is DiFi still offering her mandatory language on the Senate side, or was that amended,
changing "shall" to "should"? Thx.
