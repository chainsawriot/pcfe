Attached and below is a draft "terms of reference" for the QDDR. Cheryl and I propose that — if the opportunity arises —
                                                                                 We look forward to discussing the         B5
terms of reference after you've had a chance to review it.

On a separate matter, we've had S/P working on Cairo follow-up memos. They don't have enough concrete progress to
report yet, but they have been tasked with producing a memo for next week's meeting with POTUS that shows real
movement. I propose that you provide monthly updates, with the first one coming next week. If you'd like to do it
more frequently, we can make that happen.
