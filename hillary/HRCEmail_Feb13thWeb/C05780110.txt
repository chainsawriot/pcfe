Dear Cheryl,
I know Bob had intended to reply to you on this, but he has just stepped into.a meeting and asked
me to follow up. We have been working hand in hand with Post on the Grameen matter for
months.                                                                                                          B5




We're holding a brainstorming meeting later today at 3pm to think of further ways we can work on
the Grameen issue. And we're sending out points for Amb Roemer to use in seeking the
engagement of India, specifically Finance Minister Mukherjee (Bengali speaker), as well.

I'd be happy to answer any other questions at your convenience. And I look forward to meeting
you at some point after hearing such wonderful things about you from my former boss, Mack
McLarty!

Best,
Alyssa Ayres
