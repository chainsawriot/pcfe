Extension of the Designation of Haiti for Temporary Protected Status - DHS will announce tonight an extension of the
designation of Haiti for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 18 months from January 23, 2013 through July 22,
2014. The extension will allow currently eligible TPS beneficiaries to retain TPS through July 22, 2014. DHS, in
consultation with DoS, determined that an extension is warranted because the conditions in Haiti that prompted the
initial 2010 TPS designation and the 2011 redesignation continue to be met. OMB will publish a notice in the Federal
Register on this in the next few days.
