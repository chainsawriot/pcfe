              called me today. Very nice.

    I gave him an overall lay of the land — 70/30 split between career and political, still assessing which political
    ambassadors want to stay/go in a second term and only one post on his list is currently vacant, etc.

    He noted his "package" is currently with Valarie, Jim Messina and Alyssa and was told by them that S's recommendation
    would be a "gamechanger."

    Informed him we are just registering interest and sharing with the WH at this time as it is ultimately a WH decision, but I
    would let both of you know and to keep me apprised of his current status.




    Thx
