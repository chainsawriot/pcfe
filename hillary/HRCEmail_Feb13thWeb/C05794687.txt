     ill Clinton's ego could cost I ama in November
By Suzi Parker

On Tuesday in a CNBC interview, Clinton seemed to differ with Obama again by endorsing another extension
of the Bush tax cuts across the board.

Just last week, Republicans seized on another Clinton interview, on CNN, in which he said Mitt Romney's
business career had been "sterling." And in late May, he sent encouragement to Republican Wisconsin
Congressman and GOP Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan.

After his "sterling" remark, he made amends, appearing at three fundraisers for Obama and proclaiming that a
Romney presidency would be "calamitous for our country and the world." But he couldn't leave it at that, could
he?

When his words of praise for the GOP come back to bite him, Clinton always has excuses, like insisting he is
not an Obama campaign surrogate, but a free agent who happens to be a Democrat.

While he may be right about the economy, Democrats want to see a unified front on the campaign trail. And
that's hard to get when Clinton is involved. Remember how he undermined Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential
race with some of his off-the-cuff remarks? Some Hillary supporters still blame him for her loss. One thing was
guaranteed when he went off-message: He got media attention.

That's likely what is at play here — ego. No other politician loves attention more than Clinton, and yes, that's
saying something. While a part of him really wants to see Obama win, another part of him doesn't. This is a

man who loves to remind people that he is the only Democrat to be re-elected as president since Franklin D.
Roosevelt.

At one of Monday's fundraisers, Clinton told the crowd, "Remember me? I'm the only guy that gave you four
surplus budgets out of the eight I sent."

Certainly, Clinton is brilliant. He may, indeed, be right about tax cuts. But as an Obama adviser, he would never
stay behind the curtains for long. And in November, the former president could cost Obama. If you don't
believe me, just ask Hillary.
