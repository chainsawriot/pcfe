Marc,

I would think that Protocol would know the most about that, but I'm copying Nathan in L/EMP in case he (or one of his
colleagues) can advise. (Nathan -- Marc is the director of the Japan desk.) Thanks, Jesse

Jesse — do you or does one of your colleagues know the process of vetting individuals to serve as special envoys? We
may have a need to vet someone (s) in the near future and want to make sure we understand the process so we can
move quickly. Thanks,

Marc
