Re: Petraeus/October Surprise


My operative theory on Petraeus scandal is that it became an October Surprise that failed. Forcing the
scandal public and his .resignation would have been the trifectaâ€”leaks, Benghazi, then Petraeus--
allowing Romney to argue that Obama had created a national security collapse. It would have
overtaken the end, of the campaign.

My thought is that Leahy should be in this now and that Feinstein should be made aware, if she is not
already, of the October Surprise scenario.



Some questions:

Are there agents and other employees at FBI in regular contact with Republican members of the
House outside the regular channel of the House Intelligence Committee?

Exactly how soon was Cantor contacted by FBI sources after Petraeus was exonerated by the
investigation?

What was the decision making process of those involved in contacting congressmen Reichert and
Cantor? Who exactly in the FBI was involved in that discussion? How many people? What was their
connection to the investigation? Or was it a single rogue individual?

Did Cantor ever notify Speaker Boehner that he had been contacted and that he had contacted
Mueller? Why not? What does Boehner have to say about what Cantor did?

Did Cantor or any House staff member speak about the matter with any member of the Romney-Ryan
campaign?

Claims that Cantor was*simply alerting the FBI of the investigation by contacting Mueller are absurd
on its face. The FBI knew it was conducting the investigation. What is Cantor covering up? Was he
attempting to create pressure to force Petraeus' scandal into the public and his resignation before the
election?

What was the connection between those involved in contacting Cantor and those involved in
contacting Bob Woodward about a "Benghazi" story?

If there were irregularities in the investigation, the disgruntled FBI agents or employees should have
contaeted the FBI Inspector General. They did not. Was it because there were no irregularities? No
one has suggested any. Did they know it is a felony to disclose an espionage investigation?

Will the FBI agent(s) and employee(s) who leaked the espionage investigation to congressmen
Reichert and Cantor be the targets of a Justice Department criminal investigation? Will a grand jury
be empaneled?
