This is huge. We have effectively "untied aid." We cannot beat drums about it because we do not want a negative
congressional reaction but its one of the things S could be proud of having done when we were told we could never
make it work. © Raj

Subject: NEWSFLASH: IMPLEMENTATION AND PROCUREMENT REFORM - NEW REG ON SOURCE AND NATIONALITY

I am pleased to announce that on January 10, 2012 USAID published in the Federal Register (77 FR 1396) a revised,
final regulation concerning source and nationality requirements for procurements. The revised regulation is a further, and
far reaching, step toward simplification of USAID's procurement procedures and toward achieving Agency Implertientation
and Procurement Reform Objectives 1 and 2, Strengthening Partner Country and Local Civil Society and Private Sector
Capacity, and Objective 4, Use USG resources more efficiently and effectively. You can access the new rule by clicking

10%5C%2F3%2FAgency+for+International+Development&granuleId=2011-33240&packageId=FR-2012-
01-10&fromBrowse=true


The new regulation

 -Establishes a new, default geographic source code which tracks USAID's statutory authority by permitting
procurements, without preference, from the United States, recipient country, or developing countries. This new code will
permit for the first time procurement from the recipient country and other developing countries on equal footing with
procurements from the United States, thereby facilitating USAID's efforts to make the foreign assistance dollar go further
and do more in a time of budget constraints.

 -Preserves existing geographic source codes (110, 935) which reflect additional statutory authority to procure under the
Development Fund for Africa and for the New Independent States

  -Deletes the concept of "origin" from the rule (no more "systems determinations"!) and clarifies and simplifies the source
and nationality requirements

  -Streamlines waiver procedures, to reduce costly and inefficient bureaucratic processes

Because of the significant changes in the new regulation and at the urging of several commenters in the public rulemaking
process, the new regulation will not become effective until February 6, 2012. This "lead time" will enable USAID to revise
and issue related and supporting guidance (please look for future Agency notices about issuance of a revised ADS 310 on
Source, Nationality and also Office of Acquisition and Assistance guidance concerning administration of existing and
future contract and grant awards under the new regulation). USAID will issue a further, updated Agency Notice
concerning the effective date of the new regulation in the first week of February, 2012, and before the effective date of
February 6th, 2012. •
