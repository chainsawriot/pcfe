I met with Dave Obey and talked to Nisha right before I left. Nisha said that they would want our priorities to deal with
an allocation that is very low if there is no new budget resolution. The 2011 column of the 2010 resolution is $20 billion
below the presidents budget overall. In comparison all of the cuts in the senate resolution totalled $11 billion below the
pres bud (4 from us and 7 unallocated). I thought it was a bit early to start giving a list of what we would cut if the
allocation is very bad, but will have people work on some recommendations for us to review while Congress is away.

Jack--

When I called Nita last night to brief her on the UN action, she told me her staff and she had been trying to reach you to
get our ideas about what can be cut from our budget as part of the House's required "cutting exercise". I told her you'd
been out of the country, and, in fact, had been our point person on getting Israel into the OECD.

She made clear she wasn't enthusiastic about the process but believes we need to work together to manage. Do you
know about this? And, do you have a plan about how to respond? H
