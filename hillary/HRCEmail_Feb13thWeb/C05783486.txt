Richard (and Carlos)

Thank you for this note on Iraq energy engagement.

Apart from its substance, It prompted me to want to set a time for all three of us to meet in the interest of
organizational clarity for ENR going forward.

                                                                                                                                 B5




We are getting ready to publicly roll out the ENR                                                                 shortly so I   B6
would welcome the three of us finding a time to speak next week.                                                                 B5

I am copying Joanne to find a time.

Thanks so much.

Best.
