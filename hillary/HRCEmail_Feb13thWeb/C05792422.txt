Madam Secretary,

Your recent meetings with the Japanese and Chinese foreign ministers underscored the
substantial risk of miscalculation between the two sides and the urgency of careful and
thoughtful diplomacy. We assess that the Chinese and Japanese positions are hardening due to
a variety of factors despite a shared understanding that prolonged friction would be harmful to
regional stability and the global economic recovery. We are now engaged in delicate diplomacy
with both sides (and Taiwan) that seeks to de-escalate tensions and find an acceptable, face-
saving route out.

At the IPC we held this morning, there appeared to be broad interest in augmenting our own
diplomacy by sending a small bipartisan group of esteemed former policymakers, respected in
both countries, who would speak candidly to our key themes of cooling tensions and finding a
pragmatic resolution. Such a group might include                                          , and
                who could spark ideas for managing or resolving the problem. Sending this
group carries the advantage of showing our proactive efforts to manage the issue while not
serving as a mediator. If you agree to support this proposal, we would need to strike quickly,
preferably in the next two weeks.

I have discussed this with Jake. Danny Russel and Mark Lippert are supportive, and we will
want to move carefully to gauge high-level NSS and White House support. Speed is of the
essence.

Best,

Kurt
