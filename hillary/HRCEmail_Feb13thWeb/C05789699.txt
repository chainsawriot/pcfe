Cheryl -- WH, Counsel responded to Katy tonight. We have a path forward. Katy is looping back with OGE and hopefully
he can be pre-cleared as early as tomorrow.

I also confirmed                                  that they have all paperwork and will be ready to request agrement   B5
as soon as OGE pre-clears him.

Thx
