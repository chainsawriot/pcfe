Subject: GLOC MOU Negotiation

Marc, Tom, Doug, Ambassador, and Colleagues:

The negotiating session lasted two hours 20 minutes in the formal conference room of the Cabinet. Secretary of
Defense and Cabinet Secretary Nargis Sethi led the Pakistan side of 14, including Secretary of Finance Wajid Rana, and
representatives of MOD, GHQ Federal Board of Revenue, Customs, et. al. From the beginning, there was a spirit of
good will, compromise, and let's-get-it-done. In opening remarks, I emphasized that we want an agreement for mutual
benefit.

We closed on the MOU language except for one sentence directly related to the negative list. We made excellent
progress on the negative list, although both sides will need to consult their experts and lawyers on just a few points. We
also took some time on the Terms of Reference and made good progress there, too. We agreed we will follow up with a
small-group experts' meeting on Monday afternoon.

At the end of the negotiating session, I noted that cargo is still not moving, despite the Pakistani interagency meeting
two days ago that cleared 1579 pieces of cargo to move. I said we have a growing perception problem, and urged the
Pakistani side to get things moving ASAP. Secretary Sethi fully understood the point and said she would follow up
appropriately.

In closing, both sides emphasized the spirit of cooperation and our commitment to come to closure soonest so that we
can clear the final document on both sides and then sign.

The invaluable Elizabeth Hoffman is providing a fuller readout and will also send back details on the few remaining
questions that need further clarification.

Dick
