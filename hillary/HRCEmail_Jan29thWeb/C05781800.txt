Hi. With much difficulty,                                               contacted me last night, via Ops and a spotty satellite
phone here in Benghazi. He said that they have information that Saif Qadhafi will give a speech on 8/20, announcing that
Q is departing either the country or power or both, and that Saif will assume the head of a transitional authority. He will
repeat the usual calls for a ceasefire, inclusiveness, etc.      and I compared notes on the number of wild rumors right
now stemming from the military pressure being felt, but he felt that this one had more significance than others -- he got the
information directly from                                         I asked       what his response toF7Nas: that a
unilateral speech like that, even if it included Q's departure, would not impress anyone at hte moment. said that, from
the perspective of Benghazi, that is certainly right: no one here is in any mood to concede that Saif would lead a
transitional authority.
