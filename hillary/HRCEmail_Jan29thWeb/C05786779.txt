Expanding distro:

Spoke to                       who says there are about 1000 people surrounding the Israeli embassy in Cairo, including 100 who        1.4(D)
have penetrated the main security perimeter. The police still stand between them and the entrance, but the police are looking tired, he B1
says.

CNN ticker is reporting that the EG Ambassador has been recalled, butrays that is not official yet. Eg PM may/may have
announced it on his own_ but not the SCAF. In about an hour,r—expects DM Barak to issue a statement expressing regret for the
deaths of Eg soldiers and plans for a joint investigation. The Israeli Ambassador in Cairo has been summoned to the MFA, butt is
trying to stall him until he has the statement in hand.
