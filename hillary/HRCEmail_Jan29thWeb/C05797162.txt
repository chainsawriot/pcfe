At the Friday morning Senior Staff meeting, "S" appeared not to be too favorable to DOD personnel going into Mali

                                                                                                                         B5

DOD has now requested approval to send six folks in tomorrow [Sunday] to work with ECOWAS

Thoughts?

The DAO tdyers will attend ECOWAS meetings to support training and assistance efforts. Post acknowledges this will
increase their footprint but also contends this increase would not impede their ability to provide for security of all
personnel.
