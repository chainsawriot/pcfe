I'm looping in Jim, for his counsel and as he may have later information.

For S:

As of today, here's where we are on the G-20. At Pittsburgh it will be announced that the G-20 will have a continuing role
as the global forum on economic, financial, "and related issues." Canada will host the next G-20 mtg in June 2010 and
Korea will hold the following mtg in November 2010 on the margins of APEC.

Based on today's negtiations, there will still be a role for the G-8, as well as for other political forums, but it will not meet as
a separate summit, but rather on the margins of the NATO summit or some other summit. 5 G-8 members are apparently
on board with this, but France is holding out strongly for the G-14, apprently supported by Japan and Italy. China, as a
member of the G-5, is opposed to the G-14 b/c it feels like a second class citizen in the g-8 + 5 format. The G-5 as a
whole are asking that the G-20 be trimmed back to the original 20 to cut down on European over-representation.

The actual nature/future of the 0-8 is still to he fought out -- as I have argued in the past, we have a lot to gain with the G-
20 members who are not in the 0-14 by opposing the 0-14 as a political replacement for the G-8. But for now, it is critical
that before the US publicly commits to the G-20 (as POTUS may do in a speech on Monday) we secure two key
commitments from him.

1) You attend t:e 0-20 (after Pittsburgh) together w/ Treasury and that there b a co-sherpa process for the 0-20 as with
the 0-8 ncw. The "related issues" that Treasury contemplates addressing in the G-20 include climate change, food
security, and other development issues. We simply have to be there. Other G-20 countries, like Mexico, have their foreign
Ministries as sole sherpas.

2) That we be tasked with figuring out which parts of the g-8 apparatus (lots of working groups and ministerials) be moved
to the G-20 and which stay with the 0-8 or be constituted independently.

              is obviously the most direct source of information, altho I have deliberately not raised any attendance/sherpa
issues wf him.

Adding Huma. Thanks for the heads up. She is likely seeing him this weekend, so she could raise this if she had specific
and easy-to-digest points to make, at least as a marker. I defer to Huma on whether she has time for a call; in the
meantime writing up the points in an email would be useful.
