Re: N. Ireland forum at CGI


1. Shaun Woodward, UK Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, suggested a panel at CGI to be conducted by
former President Clinton of British and Irish prime ministers, and perhaps leaders in NI, under the theme of
"Implementing Peace."

2. Former President Clinton has conveyed to me his approval, contingent on approval of the State Department.

3. I have copied below (and attached) Woodward's letter to me.

4. Let me know to move this forward.



Dear Sid,

Following our conversations about the CGI, it would be good to try and
explore further now with President Clinton and State the idea for an event
at the CGI for Northern Ireland.

As you know, and very much thanks to the help again of HRC, we hope to be
able to move forward with the final phase of the political process in the
Autumn.

As the CGI coincides with the UN meeting and also the G20, we should explore
the idea of whether we could bring together and participation of both the
British and Irish Prime Ministers under the auspices of the CGI. The theme
could be 'Implementing Peace'. The session would explore the steps for the
peace and political process in NI and obviously a session could have wider

application into say the Middle East peace and political process.

To take this forward it would be helpful to explore this with President
Clinton and State, and following their expression of interest/approval, I
would take this forward with the British and Irish Prime Ministers.

Let me know your thoughts.

Best

Shaun
