   1. You may not have seen that the Burma IFI fix passed.

   2. Norm is in Israel today to consult on the issue you and Wendy and Johnnie discussed the other morning.

   3.                                                                                                              1.4(D)
                                                                                                                   B1

   4. Xi gave a speech today at an ASEAN gathering in which observers interpreted him as toughening
      China's rhetoric on SCS issues — he elevated the sovereignty discussion above the peaceful resolution
      discussion: "We are firm in safeguarding China's sovereignty, security and territorial integrity and are
      committed to resolving differences with neighbours concerning territorial land, territorial sea and
      maritime rights and interests peacefully through friendly negotiations."

                                                                                                                 1.4(B)
                 This still leaves a numberof questions, which we are working through. Alice emailed me this 1.4(D)
          morning to highlight one debate —                                                                     B1
                                                        McFaul is skeptical we can do that quickly and wants to
          disburse;                                                                                                B5


    6. Jim Warlick has started as the other Deputy SRAP, running the Bilateral Security Agreement
       negotiations. In a surprise, Ludin has informed us that Ambassador Hakimi will be his counterpart as
       the Afghan BSA lead negotiator, so the process will be based in DC with some negotiating sessions in
       Kabul. Ludin and Spanta would be the other central players on the Afghan side, in addition to other
       Ministries (Defense/Interior etc).

    7.                                                                                                             1.4(D)
                                                                                                                   B1
