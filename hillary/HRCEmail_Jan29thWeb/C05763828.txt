Apologies for being gone today. A few things about materials for today:

The specials will have a card with topics for your POTUS meeting.

Huma has drafts of your various remarks -- Lissa is making edits to the Iraq and Fayyad statements to make the points
sharper and to ensure that people understand what State is doing on Iraq.

You will get Q+A for the Fayyad avail from the Mitchell team to review at your pre-brief.
