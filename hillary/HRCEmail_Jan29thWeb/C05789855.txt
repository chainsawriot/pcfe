Subject: Istanbul - it's a wrap

Talks are over after a short second plenary that produced agreement on next round on May 23 in Baghdad, preceded by
a preparatory meeting between Ashton + Jalili's deputies.                                                        1.4(B)
                                                                                                                          1 4(D)

Up next in a few minutes,
Ashton delivers brief statement on behalf of group (below) and takes 2-3 Qs, followed by Jalili presser in front of a
banner bearing pictures of Iran's assassinated scientists, a map of Iran and the Persian Gulf, and the English phrase,
'Nuclear energy for everyone and nuclear weapons for no one.'

Then, Wendy backgrounds around 3:30 pm DC time.                              if you are available, can we do a call before we
do it? Will provide read-out when she's done + send transcript.

Draft P5+1 statement Ashton will deliver:

"The EU High Representative Catherine Ashton, together with the Political Directors of China, France, Germany, Russian
Federation, United States and the United Kingdom, met on 14 April 2012 in Istanbul with the Iranian nuclear negotiator
Dr. Saed Jalili in order to address the international community's concerns on the exclusively peaceful nature of the
Iranian nuclear programme.

The parties would, first of all, like to thank the Turkish government for hosting the talks.

The discussions on the Iranian nuclear issue have been constructive and useful, reflecting the terms and spirit of our
recent exchanges with Iran. We have agreed that the NPT forms a key basis for what must be serious engagement, to
ensure all the obligations under the NPT are met by Iran while fully respecting Iran's right to the peaceful use of nuclear
energy.

We want now to move to a sustained process of serious dialogue, where we can take urgent practical steps to build
confidence and lead on to compliance by Iran with all its international obligations. In our efforts to do so, we will be
guided by the principle of the step-by-step approach and reciprocity.

We expect that subsequent meetings will lead to concrete steps towards a comprehensive negotiated solution which
restores international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of the Iranian nuclear programme. This is why we
will meet again soon, on 23 May in Baghdad, preceded by a preparatory meeting of deputies."
