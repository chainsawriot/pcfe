I spoke w Jack Reed. He said I could pick the date in either Oct or Nov to be honored bt BENS. We could pick a Friday
when I'd be back in NY.

Did I ask that you set up mtg/meal w Elie Weisel and his wife?

Also, I need to see Holbrooke early on Thursday after Labor Day to be briefed before a WH mtg at 11. I can do as early as
needed.
