From a guy we know here in japan who does background searches for us etc...




This is not advice that is currently in the news. You've met the source before             Also by coincidence, I have a   1.4(C)
                                                                                                                           B1

Radiation leak from the Fukushima reactor                                                                                           1.4(C)
                    Stay indoors if at all possible. There is nothing,,no events, parties, sports, movies, etc that are worth       B1
getting more exposure to radiation. The stuff travels far, very far.




Wind is all over the place, but we must assume it is heading towards a major area like Tokyo, a city, a heat source.




As long as the radiation leak is going, and up to 24-48 hours later, the threat is at is highest in most cases. Here is a wind
chart online. It shows wind all over the place, but one trend is there - winds head to Tokyo.

Also, power outage expected to hit about 1800 this evening as more people return home and start using more
electricity. Charge any devices you have that need charging. People will draw a lot of power about 1800-1900, so expect
blackouts and brownouts. Get your flashlights ready, with new batteries.




Very similar to 3-Mile Island, and maybe Chernobyl. VOA news has this take.

Leak has been doing since last night. It is still not under control. A US team was flown in to help get this thing under control,
but that is not public record yet. It will come out later, I think.




Anway, leak from last night means it is hitting us about now. I am not going outdoors for a while.




Normally one might also take K-I (Potassium Iodine) tablets as a precautionary measure. Substitutes include alternative
sources of iodine including isojin or consuming seaweed (nori).




Wear a mask, and a hat if possible. Take a shower immediately after you return home and wash your clothes. Radioactive
steam was released yesterday and continues today. It will likely be in the area now. What I suggest above is not costly, and
not too onerous. Do it and play it safe.




Don't go outdoors unless it is necessary.
