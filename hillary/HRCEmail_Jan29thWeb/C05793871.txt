A Touchy Relationship
New York Times Editorial
Wednesday, September 5, 2012 9:35 PM EDT

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was in a philosophical frame of mind on Wednesday as she surveyed the
impasse between the United States and China on a daunting range of issues. "Our two nations," she said, "are trying to
do something that has never been done in history, which is to write a new answer to the question of what happens
when an established power and a rising power meet." As the secretary's fifth trip to China demonstrated, that is proving
to be a complicated process.

Mrs. Clinton and Chinese officials failed to agree on two big items on her agenda: defusing tensions in the South China
Sea and ending President Bashar al-Assad's violent rampage in Syria. The result was disappointing, but not unexpected
when both countries have other things on their minds. China's leaders are embroiled in a once-in-a-decade leadership
transition as well as political scandals in the Communist Party. The United States is preoccupied with a presidential
campaign.

Still, Mrs. Clinton was right to press for common ground. Bounded by some of Asia's most vibrant economies — China,
Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan and Malaysia — the South China Sea has become a virtual free-for-all as nations assert
claims to islands and even specks of rock. China has been the most aggressive, but other counties share the blame.
Confrontations over territorial control and undersea resources could easily get out of hand.

China should see the value in looking for ways to ensure regional stability. But it, too, has worries, particularly about the
Obama administration's more assertive presence in Asia, which includes strengthening military ties with Australia and
the Philippines. That is one reason the United States must balance firmness toward China with a willingness to work
together.

China's refusal to support tough United Nations Security Council sanctions against Mr. Assad is unconscionable and has
stymied cooperation on this important issue. Chinese officials say they adhere to the principle of not interfering in the

affairs of other countries, ignoring the fact that their stubbornness has helped prolong the conflict in which more than
20,000 Syrians have been killed.

Echoing Mrs. Clinton, the foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, said that Beijing would work with Washington to build a "new
type of major country relationship." The two countries at least have the words right.
