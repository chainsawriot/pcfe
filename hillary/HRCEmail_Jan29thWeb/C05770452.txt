Bilateral issues

•          Summit: Looking forward to the June 24 summit, which will give us an opportunity to
make progress on a range of issues, including our work in the Binational Commission, WTO,
adoptions, and sky marshals.

•          New START: Secretary Gates, Admiral Mullen and I will testify on Tuesday in our
Senate in support of speedy ratification of the treaty. I am optimistic that we will succeed in
winning ratification; our increasingly productive bilateral relationship is greatly helping with the
atmosphere.

•         123: Also glad we resubmitted our civil-nuclear cooperation agreement to the
Congress. We do not anticipate problems with its final approval.

•          Basketball Exchange: Understand our first youth basketball exchange will take place
next week. Look forward to some spirited competition, and maybe identifying some new NBA
prospects.

•          (If Raised) Kvrgvzstan:

                                                                    Background: Clashes on May
13 and 14 in Kyrgyzstan's south showed the Provisional Government's tenuous control. Bishkek
has remained calm, but police are on alert for demonstrations planned for May 17 to mark 40 days
since the deaths of 85 anti-Bakiyev protestors on April 7.
