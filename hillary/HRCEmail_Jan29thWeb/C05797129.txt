I'm taking the shuttle back to ny this afternoon.
I left the karzai call sheet on your bed but as you can see, they are proposing a simple welcome to the U.S. call and
doesn't have much substance to it.
Monica will ride to and from WH with you this afternoon.
She's going to bring updated schedule for tomorrow.
Getting       for 7:30am tomorrow.
See you tomorrow!
