          CARDIN STATEMENT ON THE STATUS OF THE MAGNITSKY ACT

                      "We are creating a precedent for future trade agreements"

Washington, DC â€” U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and
author of the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act, made the following statement regarding his
legislation:

"I am pleased that the Senate finally will be voting on passage of the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law
Accountability Act. In the memory of one courageous Russian, we are setting a precedent for future trade
agreements that tells the world that gross violators of human rights cannot escape the consequences of their
actions even when their home country fails to act. Visiting the United States and having access to our financial
system, including U.S. dollars, are privileges that should not be extended to those who violate basic human
rights and the rule of law.

"This bill may only apply to Russia, but it sets a standard that should be applied globally. I encourage other
nations to follow our lead. I will continue to work with my bipartisan cosponsors towards passage of the
Magnitsky sanctions for other countries so that human rights violators in all corners of the world understand
that the United States is still committed to the universal cause of liberty and human dignity for those who
stand up against oppression."
