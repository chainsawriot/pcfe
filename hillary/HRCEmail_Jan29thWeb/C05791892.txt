Madam Secretary,

My meeting              this afternoon lasted for about 2 1/2 hours. We have some work to do to tee everything up for            B5
                       but have the outline of a proposal for you all. We will need another secure call and in a
conversation with Jake a few minutes ago, thought it might make sense to do this as a conference call on Sunday
morning if you were already going to be speaking with Jake secure.                 had an additional few minutes by phone
this afternoon on some of the matters that were not appropriate for even the small group but are also on your mind.
Sorry for the mumbo jumbo of the email but am sure you understand. Will wait to hear from Huma and Jake what .
works for you. I will probably do such a call from the office so that I can have highly classified documents in front of me
but am entirely flexible on time.

                                                                                                                              1.4(D)
                                                                                                                              B1




Please don't hesitate to email or call if there are other issues on your mind. As I noted, we have asked the historian to
research the McCarthy era bannings of foreign service officers and what if anything has been done to make amends
where appropriate. Time for a glass of wine. Hope you are finding a few minutes here and there to get a break.

Best,
Wendy
