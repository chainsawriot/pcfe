Chinese and Russians had trilat at our suggestion and agreement of E3+3. Also difficult conversation. We are going to
have a plenary no later than 6pm where Cathy will read what will be our press statement, including outling factually our
and their ideas, areas of common ground, firmness and commitment, and date and place (June 14-15 in Moscow which
appears agreeable to Is)dependent on intense contacts (Ashton-Jallili to get agreement on agenda for said meeting.
After Cathy reads statement, will see if have agreement. If not, we will revert to statement that falls short of setting next
meeting. Statement makes clear what Is wanted and that we could not agree as they could not agree with all of our
ideas. Very tough environment made both easier and more difficult by fact that airport still closed. Will call after
plenary.

Have hit bad bump. Jallili rejected approach and criticized Bagheri in front of Ashton and Schmid. We are now in
discussion about how to proceed. Back in touch soon.

One more note. If sandstorm keeps us here, offering GCC conference call this evening and then will go on to Tel Aviv
tomorrow if possible. Also was roadside bomb with three killed today but appears outside green zone. When we are
finished will also meet with our press again after Ashton and Jallili press conferences.

All-
Besides the fact that a sandstorm has meant a closed airport, today appears to have moved things ahead. Ashton met
for less than a half hour with Jallili and then we had plenary for a bit more than two hours. Plenary punctuated by Jallili
approaching me at end to say hello and have very brief sentences. Outcome is a draft press statement we have drafted
that will say nuclear core, agree to continue discussions on 20% that includes our ideas and theirs, experts meeting next
week and political meeting probably June 14-15. We are asking Is not to contradict our statement. Many issues ahead
and some work needed first in our govt and then with others. Likely PD meeting with Ashton around June 11 to prepare
as well. Ashton due to have bilat shortly with Jallili to see if agree on way forward. Helga already previewed with
Bagheri. Could all still fall apart and press management afterwards will be difficult. Nonetheless, looks like we will move
forward. More when can talk secure again.
Best,
Wendy
