I'm not sure, I couldn't quite make it out. I'll find out.

But it must have been very funny because this crowd is not very happy to be working today, especially at this hour.
Although I'll note (and it shouldn't come as a surprise) that both Senators Coburn and DeMint wanted Leader McConnell
to run out the clock rather than capitulate and agree to an early vote.

Thx--I got up to watch it. What did Reid say while voting that caused laughter?

Subject: Senate Health Care Bill Passes - 60-39

As expected, the Senate health care bill passed this morning by a vote of 60-39. Senators voted from their desks, and
Vice President Biden presided in the chair.

Senator Bunning did not vote.
