SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED

                        Not much input expected from State for this.

   o   Rich noted that preparations are proceeding for Raj Shah's confirmation. He will start a round of Hill calls next
       Tuesday, and there will be a couple murder boards before his tentative hearing date on December 1.

   o   Today is in essence the drop dead date for getting nominations to the Hill in time for possible confirmation this
       year.

   o   Jack will send another letter to Senator Lugar that should result in his lifting the hold on agricultural assistance
       to Afghanistan.

   o   The timing of the Afghanistan/Pakistan rollout and hearings remains in flux.

   o   H is still waiting for the QFRs from Senator LeMieux with respect to Tom Shannon's nomination.

Afghanistan and Pakistan Bombings

   o   I noted that we still do not know the nationality of the 11 KBR contractors wounded along with 6 U.S. military in
       a suicide attack near Camp Phoenix (near Kabul) today. One foreign national was killed in the attack.

   o   Meanwhile, there were no reported U.S. casualties in the bombing of the 151 building in Peshawar, though the
       U.S. Consulate did sustain minor damage.
