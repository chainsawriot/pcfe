 His Excellency
 Bronislaw Komorowski
 President of the Republic of Poland
 Warsaw


 Dear Mr. President:

         Thank you for your letter of May 30. I was proud to honor Jan Karski with the Medal of
 Freedom, our nation's highest civilian honor. My decision to do so was a reflection of the high
 esteem in which the American people hold not only a great Polish patriot, but the extraordinary
 sacrifices of the Polish people during the Nazi occupation of the Second World War.

         In referring to "a Polish death camp" rather than "a Nazi death camp in German-occupied
 Poland," I inadvertently used a phrase that has caused many Poles anguish over the years and
 that Poland has rightly campaigned to eliminate from public discourse around the world. I regret
 the error and agree that this moment is an opportunity to ensure that this and future generations
 know the truth.

         As we all know, the Polish people suffered terribly under the brutal Nazi occupation
 during World War II. In pursuit of their goals of destroying the Polish nation and Polish culture
 and exterminating European Jewry, the Nazis killed some six million Polish citizens, including
 three million Polish Jews during the Holocaust. The bravery of Poles in the underground
 resistance is one of history's great stories of heroism and courage.

        Moreover, there simply were no "Polish death camps." The killing centers at Auschwitz-
 Birkenau, Belzec, Treblinka, and elsewhere in occupied Poland were built and operated by the
 Nazi regime. In contrast, many Poles risked their lives — and gave their lives — to save Jews from
 the Holocaust.

         That is why I paid tribute to Polish victims of the Holocaust during my visit to the U.S.
 Holocaust Memorial Museum in April. It is why I was honored to pay my respects at the Tomb
 of the Unknown Soldier and the Monument to the Heroes of the Ghetto during my visit to
 Warsaw last year. And it is why, during the 65th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-
 Birkenau in 2010, I commended the government and people of Poland for preserving a place of
 such pain in order to promote remembrance and learning for the world.

          I know well the bonds of friendship between our two countries. I was proud to welcome
  you to the NATO Summit in my hometown of Chicago, which is home to the largest Polish
  community in the world outside of Warsaw. As President, I have worked with you to strengthen
  the enduring ties between our nations so that our alliance is stronger than it has ever been.

         Poland is one of America's strongest and closest allies. We stand united in facing the
  challenges of the 2l8t century in Europe and around the world, and I am confident that, working
  together, we can ensure that the unbreakable bonds of friendship and solidarity between us will
  only grow stronger in the days and years ahead.
