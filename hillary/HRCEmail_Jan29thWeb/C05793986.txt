A notably positive and thoughtful Xinhua commentary - in Chinese for domestic
audiences - on HRC's visit.

Xinhua Commentary: Cooperation is 'Greatest Common Divisor' Between China, US

CPP20120905075014 Beijing Xinhua Domestic Service in Chinese 1304 GMT 05 Sep 12

["Xinhua Current Event Commentary" by reporters Qian Tong and Liu Hua, "Sino-US Relations: Pursuing Cooperation
and a Win-Win Situation Should Still Be the 'Greatest Common Divisor]

Beijing, 5 Sep (Xinhua) - High-level exchange between China and the United States has always drawn worldwide
attention. As the world's largest developing and developed countries, China and the United States cannot live without
dialogue and communications between them and without management and control of differences. During US Secretary
of State Hillary Clinton's visit to China, the information revealed by the two sides showed that pressing for the
building of a mutual-respect, mutually-beneficial, and win-win cooperation partnership between China and the
United States and looking into building a new type of big power relationship still are the consensus between the
two countries.

Facing myriad bilateral and multi-lateral problems, reiteration of the two countries' wishes for cooperation is decided by
the setting of the high-degree of fusion of the interest of the two sides. For China and the United States, both of them
will benefit if they work together and will be hurt if they fight each other. This is out of strategic consideration as
well as out of practical needs.

Differences and friction between the two sides objectively exist, but no one hopes to let these factors disturb or
even sway the course of these "most important bilateral relations in the world," and both sides have expressed
their wish for "management and control". Respecting each other's core interest and major concerns is an important
precondition for developing Sino-US relations, and it may also be called the bottom line.

The world is still not peaceful. From the Syria crisis, the Iran nuclear issue, and other regional issues of which the
temperatures have stayed high, to the world economy, which has recovered feebly, food security, of which the crisis has
shown indistinctly, climate change issue, over which a consensus can hardly be reached, and other major global issues,
communications and coordination between China and the United States are vitally important to dealing with and
resolving these problems and to lifting people's confidence. This year, the informal meeting of the APEC leaders,
East Asia Summit, and other important multi-lateral activities will be held one after another. Clinton's China visit
also is helpful for the two sides to communicate on and coordinate their stands on the series of important issues.

 The Asia-Pacific region also is not peaceful. Lately, inharmonious noises have kept coming up around China and the
 situations have tended to become complicated. Intentionally or out of misgivings, whenever noises come up, the effect on
 the Asia-Pacific region of the eastward shift of the US strategic focus and other US moves is talked about. The tangle of

interest of China and the United States is the most intensive in the Asia-Pacific region and the two countries also have
interacted most frequently in this region. If China and the United States are able to get along harmoniously in the Asia-
Pacific region, they probably will be able to do so in the world. Just before her China visit, Clinton again said that the
Pacific is big enough to accommodate all countries in this region, including China and the United States. Hearing
such attitude of the United States, people who are really concerned about peace, amicability, and harmony in the
Asia-Pacific region have more or less felt relieved and, at the same time, they will show greater concern whether
the words and deeds will match each other in the end.

Both China and the United States are nations with self-confidence and a broad strategic mind. After having associated
with and tried to gradually gear to each other for decades, the two countries not only have become interdependent, but
also have gained sufficient tenacity -- they know how to express themselves when they have different views, and have
channels unimpeded enough for dialogue and consultation.

There is an old Chinese saying: Change smoothens things, and once things are smoothened, they will last. The changing
world prompts China and the United States to change, to keep adjusting their strategies and policies, and to adjust their
minds. However, jointly looking for a way for an emerging power and a power determined to preserve what it has
achieved to get long that is cooperative but not confrontational, that enables the two sides to win but not a "zero-
sum" way, and that encourages good-natured competition but not vicious gaming, should still be the "greatest
common divisor" earnestly pursued by the two countries.
