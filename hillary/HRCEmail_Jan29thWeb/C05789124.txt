Cheryl,

Thank you and excellent. I look forward to discussing the protocols with you, including learning if there have been any
changes.

In the meantime, safe and productive travels, and please consider coming out to Langley for lunch with me when you
next have a bit of time so we can catch-up in person!

Cheers,

Dear Cheryl,

                                                                                              1.4(C)

                                                                                              B1
                                                                                              B3 CIA PERS/ORG

 Does all of that sound ok to you?


 If so, may I please ask you to get word around immediately -
                         only in those circumstances where he deems that to be appropriate and the best way forward?
