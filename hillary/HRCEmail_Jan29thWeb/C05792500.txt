Re: Biden Debate memo (3)


    1. Romney now says that he was "completely wrong" about his 47 percent of the American people being
       dependent victims. That statement should be taken to be a sweeping one covering everything he said to
       his donors at that closed door dinner. Let's get him on the record about being "completely wrong."
       Wrong about immigrants: "[If] you have no skill or experience...you're welcome to cross the border and
       stay here for the rest of your life." Wrong about claiming that "the Fed is buying like three-quarters of
       the debt that America issues." And so on, issue by issue. Especially: "And the best success I have
       speaking with those people is, you know, the president's been a disappointment. He told you he'd keep
       unemployment below 8 percent, hasn't been below 8 percent since." That would be: "Completely
       wrong." See transcript here: http://www.motherj ones.com/politics/2012/09/full-transcript-mitt-romney-
       secret-video
    2. Romney is a private equity arbitrageur who will do anything to close the deal. As we saw in the first
       debate, he will change any position. Politics is arbitrage for Romney. It should be anticipated that he will
       change his positions even more in the next debates. He needs Hispanic votes desperately. Why won't he
       claim a new position? He can always change it later. It's all about the deal, in this case getting elected.
       The question now is whether he will allow his running mate to hang out with the old positions in his
       debate, reserving the next about-faces for himself to unveil in the second and third debates. Therefore,
       Biden should be prepared for Ryan to pull a Romneyâ€”suddenly switch fundamental positions without
       blinking. Every time he does, catch him off base and tag him out.
