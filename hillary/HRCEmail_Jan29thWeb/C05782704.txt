Susan and Bill:                      1. After several aborted attempts, I had a lengthy conversation with President1.4(D)
Bongo about the Palestinian issue. I made all the points and pushed him hard not to support. Palestinian admission to
the UN in the UNSC or the UNGA.
                                                       . He leaves for New York Sunday afternoon and said he will not
decide how to vote until he gets to the US.

that we would continue to seek his support after he arrived in New York and that Amb Rice and Secretary Clinton
might attempt to reach him after he arrives. Bongo agreed to see me in New york to talk further --to talk further about
this issue as well as an array of African issues. 5.

the road but should be home in an hour.) Johnnie

We started pushing these countries and are coordinating with ambassadors on next steps.              s the likeliest    B1
country and Johnnie is taking that country.                                                                             1.4(D)

Interesting is that many of the countries are also on our target list for the UN vote on the Sudan human right.
Rapporteur next week. Whil we can not mix the 2 we made it clear the Palestine issue is our to priority.

Don, I sent you and johnnie a list of target countries                           on thursday that need additional
outreach regarding the potential for GA action on the palestinian issue. Amb Rice is asking for AF's help for you/johnnie
and ambs to hit these countries. Where are you on this? Thanks.

Rexon
