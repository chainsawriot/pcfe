Major Developments Report




      Media Reports: Rioter Shot and Killed by Haitian Police â€” The Daily Telegraph reports Haitian police have opened
fire on a group of looters, killing at least one of them as hundreds of rioters ransacked a market in quake-hit Port-au-
Prince. Elsewhere there were reports of officers stepping aside to allow vigilantes to deal with looters. (1100, 1/17
Telegraph)


                              NSA INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM UNCLASSIFIED
                              PRESS
      Conflicting Reports on Security: While JTF-H reported relative calm in PAP during the morning IA Concall,
mounting USG reports show the security situation deteriorating. National Security Agency (NSA) reports looting turned
violent in PAP on Saturday, when a mob of around 1,000 people fought for goods in a central commercial street. Men
with stones, knives, ice-picks and hammers battled to grab t-shirts, bags, and other items. Also, Embassy PAP reports
escapees from the National Prison are re-forming gangs and re-arming to start kidnappings and other activities. Gunfire
was heard in some neighborhoods overnight. More National Police were out yesterday, but too few to maintain order.

MINUSTAH MIL and UNPOL have been patrolling as well. Both DG of Police and MINUSTAH appear to be traumatized
by their losses. Embassy PAP INL Officer: Command and Control is urgently needed to maintain order. (1210, 1/17,
Embassy INL email)




      Water Remains Key Concern: The GoH has identified safe drinking water as the most urgent need among affected
populations. Significant capability to produce potable water exists in Haiti through several private sector companies
according to the USAID DART. The JTF-H is distributing water at 9 locations around the city and OFDA has identified and
additional 5 for use today. GoH and UN are planning on placing additional sites online today. The capacity to produce
water is estimated to be at least 1 million gallons per day. (0900, 1/17, IA Concall/internal sources)




      Shortage of Trucks and Fuel: The limiting factor for aid distribution is transport capacity. This fact, exacerbated by
the airport's limited capacity to receive, warehouse, and dispatch relief supplies. The road to DR is reported as open
with a travel time of 2hrs to PAP, but warehousing and truck transport capacity are major challenges. Trucks are
available in the Dominican Republic, but drivers will not make the journey unless security is assured. U.S. Marine units
are expected to greatly augment transport capacity with their arrival Tuesday, 19 January. Fuel reserves remain
dangerously low, potentially impacting both transportation and communications. (0900, 1/17, IA Concall)




       PAP Embassy Resupply: Embassy Santo Domingo started an overland convoy system delivering food, water, and
fuel. Santo Domingo also provided some extra vehicles to help ferry AMCITs. Santo Domingo will be running regular
convoys of food, water, and fuel to PaP. (1000, 1/17, internal email)
