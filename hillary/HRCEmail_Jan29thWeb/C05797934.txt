First, thanks for letting me tag along today. Always fun.

Thought I'd share a quick note.

Kerry met with Schumer this afternoon to discuss Kerry's nomination. We were waiting in Kerry's front office where
they had the TV tuned to HRC's HFAC hearing. Schumer couldn't stop raving about HRC's performance and stamina. He
kept talking about her appearance in the morning at SFRC and how she commanded the proceedings. Even as he was
walking out of the room, he kept saying, "I can't believe it... look... she's still going!"

He seemed sincerely impressed.
