Ops tried to build the call and they were unsuccessful because of phone problems with Cheryl.

Cheryl ran off to an 11:00 meeting.

SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED




Somalia




      Jack reported briefly on results of meeting with OFAC on Somalia humanitarian assistance. He expressed concern
that no definite limits were being discussed for amounts that could be paid.




Afghanistan




                 Not much input expected from State for this.




Secretary's Meetings with Russians and Chinese




•    Bill said he had been in touch with Jake and would send updated points on START and Iran for the Secretary's
meetings with Lavrov and Yang tomorrow. (Note: I have forwarded these to Jake via the Line Team on the high side.)




Legal Issues




                                                                                                                     B5

        Anticipate questions on Afghanistan and Honduras.




Congressional Issues




     Rich noted that preparations are proceeding for Raj Shah's confirmation. He will start a round of Hill calls next
Tuesday, and there will be a couple murder boards before his tentative hearing date on December 1.




        Today is in essence the drop dead date for getting nominations to the Hill in time for possible confirmation this
year.




•    Jack will send another letter to Senator Lugar that should result in his lifting the hold on agricultural assistance to
Afghanistan.




        The timing of the Afghanistan/Pakistan rollout and hearings remains in flux.




        H is still waiting for the QFRs from Senator LeMieux with respect to Tom Shannon's nomination.




Afghanistan and Pakistan Bombings




      I noted that we still do not know the nationality of the 11 KBR contractors wounded along with 6 U.S. military in a
suicide attack near Camp Phoenix (near Kabul) today. One foreign national was killed in the attack.




    Meanwhile, there were no reported U.S. casualties in the bombing of the ISI building in Peshawar, though the U.S.
Consulate did sustain minor damage.
