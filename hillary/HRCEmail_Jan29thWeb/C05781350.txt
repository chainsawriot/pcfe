Hi Jake,


Please pass to S. This is quite a significant development of which she should be aware. It all remains very highly
confidential at this point. The last time this happened was 2005

Today, the International Energy Agency (IEA) began the process to release oil stocks. This is still extremely close hokbi
and will NOT be made public.
                                                                                                                      1.4(B)
                                                                                                                      1.4(D)
 The step the lEA took was to provide members with a confidential assessment, today at 1430 Paris time, starting the
process under which the 28 members of the organization would release portions of their strategic petroleum stocks.




                                                                                                                       B1
The Secretariat document notes that disrupted Libyan oil production since the end of May, has cumulatively removed
132 million barrels of oil from the market. As a point of reference, the last lEA coordinated oil stock draw following
                                                                                                                       14(B)
                                                                                                                       1.4(D)
hurricane Katrina in 2005 was executed to prevent a possible disruption on the order of 38 million barrels.




Barring any objection by member-states, the lEA plans to issue a final decision on June 23.
                                                   No final decision on the exact timing has been made, however
