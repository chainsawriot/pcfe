Subject: Mexico update

Following up on our Monday conversation re: Mexico, here is an update on where things stand and next steps.

I PC:




                                                    Carlos followed up with a classified email to 7th floor principals on

Next steps with interagency:




Higher-level interagency engagement:

Now that the issues identified in the DoD/DHS proposal are being discussed




Ed in my office will stay in close touch with D(S) to make sure none of the issues are dropped as the Mexico coverage
shifts back to Jim and will continue to support him on the issues that we have been working on.
