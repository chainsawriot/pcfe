I'm hardly qualified to be the spokesman for this group, but it's been a tremendous four years. Top to bottom, I think
everyone can be proud.

I've said it many times before but it's worth repeating -- most principals rely on staff to prop them up so they can look
good. S is the rare person where the converse is true -- she lifts us all up and makes us all look good.

And while it all starts with S, for me it's also about the community she's created -- all the brilliant people drawn to her,
those who inspire with their words, actions, and passion.

Cheryl, you not only built that community, you lead it. None of the last four years happens without your caring and
thoughtful stewardship.

And while we've each benefited immensely from your leadership, I think I speak for all of us when I say the greatest gift
has been your friendship.

I for one can't thank you enough.

 Thank you all - for today, the last months, for four years of impeccable support and stewardship.

 You have always been ground zero for what she was able to do on the Hill - yesterday and the past four years are a
 testament to your work, love and support.

 Miguel was there representing all of you today - and it was like having you all in the room.

 Thank you.

For her.

But mostly for me.

You have each in your own and collective ways made my life possible over the last four years. And I am forever in your
debt.
