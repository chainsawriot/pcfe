Cheryl,

This is what I have feared and why I flew to Washington last week.




It makes me look forward to dealing with Sri Lanka.

Best, Steve

Cheryl,

I am now back in Sierra Leone, where I just received this email from Sen. Harkin. I have not been able
to reach his chief of staff to discuss the way forward. Did you have any success with the latest argument
for restoring to State the Sch. C positions that were taken away? If not, I know Sen. Harkin in on
Appropriations-Foreign Ops. and I think would be willing to push.

Best, SR
