Subject: Meeting with Than Swe

Patrick and I had a good meeting/lunch with Burmese UN PerRep Than Swe on Friday. High lights:

--N PT thought the visit was flawless. Secretary Clinton made everyone feel comfortable; she was
balanced, courteous and respectful.

--The Burmese thought the highlight was the Shwedagon visit, showing S appreciation and sensitivity
toward the Burmese.

                                                                                                            1.4(B)
                                                                                                            1.4(D)
