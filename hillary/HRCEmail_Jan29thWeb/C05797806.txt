We needed this like a hole in the head.

Subject: Karzai

David: I need to pass on something I learned, and I think you are one of the few people who will
have the historical sense to appreciate it. I saw Saad Mohseni last week in Dubai, and he told me
he had given Karzai William Dalrymple's "Return of a King," and that Karzai has been staying up
late reading it — the inner circle at the palace has been asking Saad what he gave Karzai. (The book
is about the first Anglo-Afghan War, and the return of Shah Shujah — as you know, Karzai is
obsessed with Shah Shuja.) Unfortunately, the last twenty pages of Dalrymple's otherwise
exemplary book is a superficial analogy between the first Afghan war and our efforts over the past
decade. And it compares Karzai to Shah Shuja explicitly. As well as arguing that Shah Shuja would
have been better off throwing out British forces.

I can't imagine a worse thing to have Karzai read before he visits the President.

I suppose the damage is done, but thought I would at least let you know.
