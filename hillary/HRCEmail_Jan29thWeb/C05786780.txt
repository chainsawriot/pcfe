Unsurprisingly, it looks like it will drag on.

Subject: Saifs speech

Please distribute to whomever else needs to know. I have heard from several people in touch with                              1.4(D)
                       that Saif now will not/not announce that Q is stepping down and that he, Saif, is assuming duties as B1
transitional chief. Instead, the Tripoli crowd is considering two different approaches for a speech that is still supposed to
take place Saturday evening Tripoli time. One approach is to call on the supporters of the regime to prepare for a big
battle to defend Tripoli, to defend Tripoli to the death. The second approach, which reportedly is where they are
leaning, is to have a reconciliatory speech that calls for a transitional process, constitutional reform, etc. — all good
concepts but failing to include the necessary punch line of Q's departure.                                    says that
                      s seeking confirmation that some key countries would welcome Sail's speech if Saif takes the second
course, arguing that knowing the speech will be praised tips the balance in favor of that approach.

We are off now to see Abduljalil, TNC Chairman, to reinforce the points about trying to find a solution that avoids
massive bloodshed in Tripoli. We were awakened this morning to a huge amount of celebratory gunfire on the reports
that Brega has fallen to the rebels. Despite the large number of casualties being suffered by the rebels, I do not believe
we're going to find much incentive on the TNC's part to negotiate right now.

I leave tomorrow mid-day for Cairo.
