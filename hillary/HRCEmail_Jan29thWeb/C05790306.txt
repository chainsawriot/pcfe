Madam Secretary,
Hopefully Bill or Jake has been able to brief you on last night's (actually early this morning's) secure call. Today, besides
the fact that a sandstorm has meant a closed airport, things appear to have moved things ahead. Ashton met for less
than a half hour with Jallili and then we had plenary for a bit more than two hours. Plenary punctuated by Jallili
approaching me at end to say hello and have very brief sentences. Outcome is a draft press statement we have drafted
that will say nuclear core, agree to continue discussions on 20% that includes our ideas and theirs, experts meeting next
week and political meeting probably June 14-15. We are asking Iranians not to contradict our statement. Many issues
ahead and some work needed first in our govt and then with others. Likely PD meeting with Ashton around June 11 to
prepare as well. Ashton due to have bilat shortly with Jallili to see if agree on way forward. Helga already previewed with
Bagheri. Could all still fall apart and press management afterwards will be difficult. Nonetheless, looks like we will move
forward. If the sandstorm does not abate, likely to do GCC meeting by conference call and then to Tel Aviv tomorrow.
More when can talk secure again.
Best,
Wendy
