Subject:                          State of play



We lightly edited the reconciliation language in the Afghan draft of the joint statement in order to bless the office more
explicitly.



The team shared this text tonight with Stanekzai and Hakimi (separately), but Spanta, Ghani, et al pled exhaustion after
a long day. They stressed that we need feedback on our draft as early as possible in the morning. Hakimi appeared to be
looking for ways to back out of the understanding reached over dinner.

The Afghans are meeting at 7AM tomorrow and briefing Karzai at 8AM. We then have a coordination meeting on the
joint statement at 8:30.
