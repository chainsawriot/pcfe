Let's discuss - I can see how they might feel differently so we should have a frame for how we go at it if we chose this for
your cgi event.

I think this is a good idea and see no conflict.

Re: N. Ireland forum at CGI



1. Shaun Woodward, UK Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, suggested a panel at CGI to be conducted by former
President Clinton of British and Irish prime ministers, and perhaps leaders in NI, under the theme of "Implementing
Peace."

2. Former President Clinton has conveyed to me his approval, contingent on approval of the State Department.

3.1 have copied below (and attached) Woodward's letter to me.

4. Let me know to move this forward.




Dear Sid,

Following our conversations about the CGI, it would be good to try and explore further now with President Clinton and
State the idea for an event at the CGI for Northern Ireland.

As you know, and very much thanks to the help again of HRC, we hope to be able to move forward with the final phase
of the political process in the Autumn.

As the CGI coincides with the UN meeting and also the G20, we should explore the idea of whether we could bring
together and participation of both the British and Irish Prime Ministers under the auspices of the CGI. The theme could
be 'Implementing Peace'. The session would explore the steps for the peace and political process in NI and obviously a
session could have wider application into say the Middle East peace and political process.

To take this forward it would be helpful to explore this with President Clinton and State, and following their expression
of interest/approval, I would take this forward with the British and Irish Prime Ministers.

Let me know your thoughts.

Best

Shaun
