H: Shaun says your speech hit just the right notes and has created the right political space. It would
be helpful to know your impressions from your meetings, especially your sense of political nuance,
etc. Shaun is meeting again tomorrow with the parties and will report to me at the end of the day and
I'll send you a note about what he learns about your meetings. Good luck in Moscow. Sid
