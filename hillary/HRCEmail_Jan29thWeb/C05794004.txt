Just want to bring you up to date on DRC. Spoke with Kabila tonight from Brussels. Spoke with Kagame and Museveni in
last 48 hours. Johnnie has spoken with foreign and defense ministers. Susan and I have spoken numerous times on UNSC
resolution that has now been resolved; vote likely tonight. Johnnie and Mike Posner engaged this evening

              Kabila is still in Kampala as are Kagame and Museveni. No breakthrough yet but conversations will
continue tomorrow.                                       key parties talking. Johnnie, please add as needed. Thanks.
