Dear Cheryl,

First, I want to thank you for your time and for giving us the opportunity to discuss FINCA's work yesterday. Natalie
Portman, our Ambassador of Hope, and the rest of the team deeply enjoyed our conversation and we are thrilled to
hear that the Administration and the Secretary of State's Office shares our views regarding what type of support is
needed to get the microfinance industry to the next level, and the role of contractors in USAID's development projects
implementation.

As promised, I am attaching a brief overview of FINCA's experience with contractors/consultants involvement in
microfinance during the past few years.

Please let me know if this is what you need or if you require additional information. Also, we would be delighted to
facilitate Secretary Clinton's visit to our microfinance programs in El Salvador and Honduras during her upcoming trip.
Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help make this happen.

Soledad Gompf
