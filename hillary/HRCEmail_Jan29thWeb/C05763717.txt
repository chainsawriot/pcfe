STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON

Missing and Detained Americans in Iran

The United States is deeply concerned about the welfare of our American citizens who have been detained or are
missing in Iran. We once again urge Iran's leadership to quickly resolve all outstanding American citizen cases.

This includes the case of the American scholar, Kian Tajbakhsh, who has spent his career working to enhance mutual
understanding between Iran and the United States. The Government of Iran should immediately release Mr. Tajbakhsh
from detention and allow him to depart Iran to continue his academic pursuits.

Regarding the three American hikers, Joshua Fattal, Shane Bauer and Sarah Shourd, who were detained by Iranian
authorities on July 31, we once again call on the Iranian government to live up to its obligations under the Vienna
Convention by granting consular access and releasing these three young Americans without further delay.

We also remain concerned about the case of Robert Levinson, who has been missing in Iran since March 9, 2007. We
call on the Government of Iran to assist in providing any information on his whereabouts and in ensuring his prompt
return to the United States.

Our goal is to ensure the safe return of all our missing or unjustly detained American citizens to the United States as
quickly as possible so that they can be reunited with their families.
