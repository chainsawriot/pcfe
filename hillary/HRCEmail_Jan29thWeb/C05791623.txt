So I've spun a select small group of our reporters off the record, but possibly to no avail! Let's see how tomorrow goes.

As you can see below, there is still some uncertainty about how/when any oil deal would be announced. So let's not say
anything for the time being. I will check with the AUHIP as soon as possible.

Subject: RE: Oil deal reached

To confirm: no mention whatsoever of the oil deal during the Pagan and Karti briefings at the PSC open session. Pagan
announced the usual that "RSS has offered an extremely generous economic package to the GoS, making substantial
concessions, which have yet to be reciprocated by Sudan.... instead, Sudan chose to extort RSS by attempting to impose
exorbitant transit fees and additional surcharge on the use of infrastructure." Pagan talked to press in the AU hallway
after the open session ended. Not sure if he said anything there about a deal, but doubt it. A very gloomy Deng Alor
noted frustration to me that Pagan was talking to the press so soon.

The only mention about potential HA deal was by Karti in a very muddled way. He noted that this morning something
was "finalized" with the tripartite group and GoS, and they'll convene a meeting in Khartoum next week to discuss (this
meshes with what Haile said would happen: that the deal wouldn't be inked here, but in Khartoum, and there will be
follow-on implementation planning meetings there).

I'll go over my notes for some more gems from the PSC open session, but there was really nothing new announced by
either party, and quite a bit of box-checking and scoring points for the record against the other. I have a hardcopy of
Pagan's statement that I'll scan tomorrow and send out. No one was really impressed after the session ended. Given the
non-mention of an oil deal, and the muddled mention of the HA agreement, UK, EU, and us agreed to take out the
contingency language we had put in our remarks at last minute in case the parties mentioned the oil deal or GOS
mentioned the specifics of the HA agreement. I gave the comments as per the document cleared last night by Amb.
Lyman.

Closed session b/w AUHIP, UN, and PSC members still going on now. Will likely have more to report after the 11am
AUHIP brief tomorrow here at hotel. Until then I don't think we should broadcast the oil deal. We might also want to
wait and see what the PSC communiqué details. Probably won't get out until tomorrow.

Ambassador,

Will do. Did you respond to Jake? We can follow up with Matt if needed. We aren't sure if/when Mbeki will announce
the deal, but after he does S could put this statement out.

Thanks,

Princeton, can you let us know wheri Mbeki announces it so that we can welcome it?
