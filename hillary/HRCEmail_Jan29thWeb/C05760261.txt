Madam Secretary,

I just got a call frorri      ndicating that they no longer need you to call Congressman Carney. However, they still   B5
remain very interested in you calling both Congressmen Berry and Ross.

I understand you received information regarding Ross's position. Below please find additional information on
Congressman's Berry's position as well as some talking points                                                          B5
Congressman Berry Background Points:

•-                                                                                                    Congressman
Berry is one of the Congressional pro-life Democrats who signed several letters in recent months to Speaker Pelosi
asking her to allow a vote on an amendment to strike the abortion funding provision in any legislation. Rules
Chairwoman Slaughter has said members will not be permitted to offer amendments to the bill, except for a Republican
substitute amendment. Any last-minute changes in the bill will be offered as part of the resolution governing floor
debate.

• In addition to abortion funding, Berry takes issue with the claim that the regional disparities language in the bill is
done. He does not believe rural hospitals will get a good reimbursement rate under the plan outlined in the bill. This is
his main substantive problem.

• Berry also believes the legislation should contain a minimum reimbursement for doctors that is equal to the national
average.

• Like many others, Berry is concerned about how the legislation's reforms would be paid for. He has said publicly that
wants to see more money taken from the drugmakers and insurance industry. "If they aren't squealing to the high
heavens, we haven't hit them hard enough," he has told reporters.

• Berry reportedly understands and appreciates how historic this moment is. He has said that he knows "something
needs to get done". For that reason, he has indicated that he is entirely dug in and resigned to voting "no."
