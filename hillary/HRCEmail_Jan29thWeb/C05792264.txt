Nothing urgent. Can give you latest on the situation after 830.

On other issues, a few things:
                                                                                                                        1.4(B)
                                                                                                                        1.4(D)
                                                                                                                        B1

2. Hanford is still working on Pastor Jones -- everyone agrees that you should not/not call. He may well go ahead
tomorrow, in which case we have teed up a pretty tough statement.

                                                                                                                             B5



                                                                                                                        1.4(B)
                                                                                                                        1.4(D)
                                                                                                                        B1
5. We need your signoff on the formal Afghan strategic partnership agreement document. We've passed                          B5
      that it's coming and the specials will get it to you over the weekend.

That's it for now -- maybe a couple of other things in a bit.

No need to call--I'm at dinner and could call after 8:30 to talk if needed.
