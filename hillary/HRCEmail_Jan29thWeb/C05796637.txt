Subject: Israel readout

Hey man, I know you're on your way to israel tmw, and since I just wrapped up two days here I figured I'd send along
this quick readout fyi. I joined Burns as the OSD rep to the Strategic Dialogue with the MFA, and yesterday had separate
meetings with Amidror, MoD Pol-Mil Director Amos Gilad and IDF J5 MG Nimrod Sheffer (I also chatted with israeli
policy planning chief; he's an interesting guy that we should do something with when he's next in town).
                                                                                                                    1.4(B)
                                                                                                                    1.4(D)
No showstoppers, as each meeting hit on similar themes:
                                                                                                                     B1




3) Iran                                                                                  (but were appreciative of
consultations). I emphasized the seriousness with which the Administration is dealing with the policy of prevention by
touting the impact of sanctions on the Iranian economy and diplo isolation --                     the "simultaneous          B5
multivector pressure strategy" -- and repeating that all options remain on the table yet there is still time.




That's it from here. Make sure spence behaves. Hope to see you soon. Have a great trip. Derek
