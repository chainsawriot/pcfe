Iraq: Wave of Baghdad blasts kills at least 95
BAGHDAD (AP) Iraqi officials have increased the casualty toll to at least 95 people killed and more than 400 wounded in
a wave of bombings in Baghdad. The toll from Wednesday's mid-morning attacks has risen throughout the day as more
bodies have been pulled from the rubble. Police and hospital officials provided the number of dead and wounded on
condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to talk to the media. The deadliest blast was a truck bombing
targeting Iraq's Foreign Ministry building near the Green Zone, minutes after a suicide truck bomber struck the Finance
Ministry in another part of Baghdad. It was the deadliest apparently coordinated attack this year and comes amid fears
that government troops aren't ready to provide security.
