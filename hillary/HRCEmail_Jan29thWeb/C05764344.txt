       Re: Latest/N. Ireland


       After five hours of talk at Downing Street tonight, Thursday, October 8, Shaun Woodward tells
       me that it seems Gordon Brown has brokered a financial package with Peter Robinson and
       Martin McGuinness that may in turn break the deadlock on devolution of policing and justice.
       They have covered the major issues in stage two in their discussions. On Monday, Brown will
       formally set out the details in a letter to Robinson and McGuinness. Gordon will share these with
       you when you meet with him on Sunday at Chequers. Shaun says that both Robinson and
       McGuinness, subject to some minor details, should be in a position to recommend to Unionists
       and Nationalists that this is a strong deal. The letter will confirm the details.
                                                                                                              1.4(D)
                                                                                                              B1




                I hope that's right.
