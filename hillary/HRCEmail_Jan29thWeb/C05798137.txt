Madam Secretary,

I just wanted to drop you a quick note of thanks for everything you've done for me personally and throughout my
career. As you can imagine,                                           and with your tenure at State coming to a close,
like many I've been doing a lot of reflecting. What I know is that none of what I'm doing now would have been possible
had you not taken a chance on a young(ish) lawyer who was still very much learning how Congress works (or sometimes
doesn't work).

The time I spent with you and your team in the Senate and at State were incredibly formative. Every day I learned
something new. It was like going to school everyday. And the community you created, the brilliant people you attracted
to your team -- I count many of them among my closest friends.

So with deep gratitude, I want to be sure to say thank you.
