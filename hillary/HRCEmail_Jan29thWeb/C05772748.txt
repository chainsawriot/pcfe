The Secretary's Call Sheet for Joint Special Envoy Kofi Annan



(SBU) Purpose of Call: Obtain Annan's agreement to seek FM Lavrov's acceptance of our sine qua non for launching a
contact group on Syria: that Asad's resignation and departure from Syria must be an essential element in any Syrian-led
political transition process.


                                                                                                                          B5

(SBU) Background: Annan has been                         on the issue of Asad's early departure, and his team was       1.4(B)
                 about the goals of a contact group in their conference call with                             June      1.4(D B5
14. Moreover, they raised legalistic and process-related questions that could muddle a contact group's launch or        B1
proceedings.                                                                                                               B1
                              by making advance agreement on the issue a precondition for a contact group.                1.4(B)
                                                                                          from Syria must be an early     1.4(D)
outcome of a transition process.
