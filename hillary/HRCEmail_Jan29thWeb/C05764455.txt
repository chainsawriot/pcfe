Senior Staff Meeting

Liberia: Death of American Citizen/UN employee

      •    Cheryl noted the apparent suicide yesterday of the American Citizen employed by the UN in Liberia who had
           been under investigation for sexual crimes and had been placed under house arrest. PA is working on guidance,
           though Ian Kelly reported that there have been no inquiries thus far. L noted that they had previously
           determined the citizen did not have immunity. Among the questions to be answered is what happens to
                                                (AF noted in the expanded staff meeting that investigations of the American
           Citizen's alleged crimes as well as the circumstances of his death are ongoing.)

Interrogations/transfers

      •    Joan noted that she will participate in Hill briefings at 11:00 this morning on the release of documents related to
           Bush Administration policy on interrogations and prisoner transfers, as well as the release of the Obama
           Administration's task force report on future interrogations and transfers. Joan said that the transfer portion of
           the task force report will focus on the State Department role, but she observed


Public Affairs

      •    Ian said that the focus will be on Afghanistan, where the press has zeroed in on Admiral Mullen's observation
           over the weekend that the situation is "serious and deteriorating," and where Abdullah Abdullah is alleging
           widespread election fraud. He also expects more questions on reaction to the "hero's welcome" for the
           Lockerbie bomber in Libya.

Honduras

      •    Dan noted that the C-17 Air Force plane carrying OAS Secretary General Insulza as well as the foreign ministers
           of Mexico, Panama, Costa Rice, Argentina and the Dominican Republic has left Miami for Honduras. We sent
           someone from the Secretariat along just to manage the logistics.

Burundi
                                                               177

   •    Phil Carter said that there are reports that FDRL (Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda) rebels have
        infiltrated Burundi, and that the military forces of Burundi and Rwanda may conduct joint operations against the
        rebels.

Thailand

   •    Scot Marcie! said that tomorrow is the deadline for the Government of Thailand to file an appeal in the
        extradiction request for Viktor Bout. Scot noted that there may be a request for the Secretary to call the Thai
        FM in this regard.

Somalia — Humanitarian Assistance

   •    Eric Schwartz said that we appear to be closer to a resolution of the USAID/OFAC dispute related to
        humanitarian assistance to Somalia, adding that we should have a copy of a new letter in a day or two. Eric also
        noted that the drought in Kenya is making the humanitarian situation all the more critical.

Afghanistan

   •    Paul Jones reported that while there may be preliminary results of the election announced tomorrow, the
        significant allegations of fraud will complicate the vote counting. (He noted that the Independent Election
        Commission has the authority, among other things, to nullify the votes from particular polling stations if the
        allegations are verified.) The final results may not be known until mid-September, and Richard Holbrooke has
        said we should wait for the final pronouncement of the Independent Election Commission before we make a
        comment.

UNGA

   •    10 said that this week is the deadline for papers


Strategy Papers

   •    Cheryl noted that there would be a series of taskers this week for papers for the Secretary to provide the basis
        for strategic planning for the Fall.
