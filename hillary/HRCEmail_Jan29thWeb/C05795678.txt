MS, we just heard that the Foreign Minister Rafik Abdessalem is considering visiting Washington this Friday, but will only
do so if he can have a meeting with you. He said the purpose of the visit would be to improve Tunisia's image and
discuss the September 14 attack on the U.S. Embassy in Tunis. The team is on board with you seeing him but wanted to
be sure you were as well before we sent back an official response. As you know Friday is tight but Jake felt you could
skip the 11:00am-12pm              to do this bilateral. Thank you â€” Lona
