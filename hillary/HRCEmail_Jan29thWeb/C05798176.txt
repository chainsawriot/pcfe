Subject: What a terrific interview

Dear Cheryl:

Greetings, and I thought that the Secretary and the President were just terrific on the "60 Minutes".

America was fortunate to have her as our foreign affairs leader these past years!

Lets have lunch once you start a new chapter in your life.

Regards,

Aaron Williams
