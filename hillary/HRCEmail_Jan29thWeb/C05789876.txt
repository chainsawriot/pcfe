Dear Phil,
                    wishes indeed the Chicago summit to be a great success for NATO and for his friend Barack Obama.
Although he profoundly regrets                                    he agrees to the EU NATO package you and I discussed
over the last few days, that is: -EU participation in the NAC meeting, the ISAF meeting and the Foreign Ministers' dinner.
-A Clinton-Ashton-Rasmussen meeting with a photo op with President Obama and Herman Von Rompuy. I think we can
also agree that this includes appropriate language in the press event to highlight the critical importance of NATO EU
cooperation and strong U.S. support for European defense. We also count on your total support for language in the
communique that would show that the EU's absence from core partners' meeting cannot be interpreted as meaning that
we have moved back from Lisbon. The Chicago communi • ue will therefore have to reiterate very clearly that the EU is a
"unique and essential partner" for NATO. Best wishes
