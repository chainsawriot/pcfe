Ahead of S - Karzai call, see the notes below from Petraeus and Tony Wayne. Both have engaged with HK and other srm
Afghan officials.

They believe speech will be one of unity, with a reference to working out differences within a unified strategy.



                                                     Ghani was meeting with the concerned officials (sounds like both
Vice Presidents are key).

Tony, et al: Just back from a good 70-min meeting with Pres Karzai.
Made the points I noted I'd lay out in the email below, and had a good discussion. Provided a lot of specifics for each
issue to show where we've made changes in recent months, provided detailed assessments of what the targeted

operations have accomplished, agreed with the need to ensure that our actions, together with those of our Afghan
partners, garner support of the people, and so on. And did underscore the need for a united front as we go forward.




Again, productive session. Vr - Dave

I have a one-on-one with Pres K for an hour at 1200 today, too, Tony, and I'll stress the need for a unified front. I will
also be laying out in detail the programs we're executing to address the various items of concern, while also noting that
we all want to arrive at the same place, but it will take time and we need to resolve any differences behind closed doors.
And the US can't be seen as having to go it alone in this effort, either. Best - Dave

I have a call out to Spanta and will reach out to Daudzai. Jim Keith will reach out to the acting Foreign Minister. Mark
