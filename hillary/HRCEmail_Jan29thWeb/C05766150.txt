I can't tell if anyone is listening to Obama at un but the lack of clear Afghanistan policy is unwinding the coalition and

Happy to give you confidential feedback on cgi speech though it's an easy audience. Good chance to put down the
Iranian and libyan sideshows while building upon message of renewed global cooperation.
