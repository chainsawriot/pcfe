A lot of research exists and a lot more can be developed to make sure that whatever expense is incurred in developing a
new branding strategy ends up producing the results we want.

Thanks -         will be considered b/c cause she is highly qualified so we don't need to make her automatic.

The branding issue is an issue - what is your sense of the specifics of the hold up?

Best

Cheryl,

I think the selection process looks fine.




Also, on the issue of the branding memo, we have some serious legal issues that our team is wrestling with.
I know there is time urgency with Judith leaving but we are not going to be able to sign off on an agency memo today.
Just wanted to flag for you because I know the issue is important.
