Subject: Syria/UNSCR - P5 readout

You will see from the readout below, that Moscow instructed its DPR that any Chapter VII reference is a redline. Further
negotiations of the full Council on the UK draft are ongoing, though unlikely to have any impact on the continued divide
among the P5.

Based on where we are by day's end today, we will likely want to consider further outreach to Moscow.

After the meeting, P3 PermReps agreed to put the Western draft into "blue," meaning that were a vote called, the
Western draft could be voted first. Experts meet at 1100 for the first round of negotiations, to be follow by PR-level
negotiations at 1500.
