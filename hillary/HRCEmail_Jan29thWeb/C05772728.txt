Major Developments Report




      Media Reports: Rioter Shot and Killed by Haitian Police â€”The Daily Telegraph reports Haitian police have opened
fire on a group of looters, killing at least one of them as hundreds of rioters ransacked a market in quake-hit Port-au-
Prince. Elsewhere there were reports of officers stepping aside to allow vigilantes to deal with looters. (1100, 1/17
Telegraph)




      Conflicting Reports on Security: While JTF-H reported relative calm in PAP during the morning IA Concall,
mounting USG reports show the security situation deteriorating. National Security Agency (NSA) reports looting turned
violent in PAP on Saturday, when a mob of around 1,000 people fought for goods in a central commercial street. Men
with stones, knives, ice-picks and hammers battled to grab t-shirts, bags, and other items. Also, Embassy PAP reports
escapees from the National Prison are re-forming gangs and re-arming to start kidnappings and other activities. Gunfire
was heard in some neighborhoods overnight. More National Police were out yesterday, but too few to maintain order.
MINUSTAH MIL and UNPOL have been patrolling as well. Both DG of Police and MINUSTAH appear to be traumatized
by their losses. Embassy PAP INL Officer: Command and Control is urgently needed to maintain order. (1210, 1/17,
Embassy INL email)

      Water Remains Key Concern: The GoH has identified safe drinking water as the most urgent need among affected
populations. Significant capability to produce potable water exists in Haiti through several private sector companies
according to the USAID DART. The JTF-H is distributing water at 9 locations around the city and OFDA has identified and
additional 5 for use today. GoH and UN are planning on placing additional sites online today. The capacity to produce
water is estimated to be at least 1 million gallons per day. (0900, 1/17, IA Concall/internal sources)




      Shortage of Trucks and Fuel: The limiting factor for aid distribution is transport capacity. This fact, exacerbated by
the airport's limited capacity to receive, warehouse, and dispatch relief supplies. The road to DR is reported as open

I wanted to make sure you were connected to Amb Lewis Lucke who is leading our disaster response effort in Haiti.
Nishant Roy (also cc'd) is his special assistance there for now.




We want to make sure that 1) medical supply priorities are communicated to us and others, 2) the health sector plan for
Haiti is informed by your thinking (Carlene Dai is our mission director and has been working on that topic), and 3) any
security needs are communicated to Gen. Keen through Lewis so we are offering protection to key health sector
facilities.




You can reach Lewis and Nishant by text in addition to email.




Best of luck with your work Paul we are standing with you to support you at this critical time!

Raj
