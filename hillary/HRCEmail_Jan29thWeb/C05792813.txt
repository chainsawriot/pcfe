Subject: Sasae call

Just got off with Sasae. He thanked us for quick action on agrement. He's planning to arrive in late nov early dec
timeframe. Purpose of call was for him to inform us that GOJ will take steps shortly to buy the Senkakus from their
private owner. They have agreed on a price and the private owner is trying to gain the understanding of mayor ishihara
on this course of action. Ishihara is unlikely to consent. On my last visit to Tokyo on Aug 7, I urged Sasae and GOJ to
consult and advise Beijing on their plans. The GOJ has just concluded a round of deliberations and apparently their PRC
counterparts were irate. Sasae however believes that China actually understands the necessity of these actions and will
accept them. (I'm not so sure.)

The GOJ has asked for further consults with me in Vlad and I will be sure to schedule.

Best,

Kurt
