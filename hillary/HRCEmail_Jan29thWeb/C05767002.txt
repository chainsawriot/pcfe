Jake,

Following are a few further thoughts on Iran (pls share with HRC if you'd like):

                                                                                                          1.4(D)

Cheryl-- don't know if you remember me. We worked together in the Clinton WH. I worked at the NSC for Sandy and
Tony and worked a lot with Pat Griffin. I kept a Dem foreign policy list for the past 8 years or so, circulating national
security op-eds and articles by Dems to Dems.

I'm now working for Leon Panetta at the CIA, but I am not writing to you in that capacity. This is my own initiative



                          He is smart, level headed and very loyal. He would do an excellent job.

I am not trying to interfere, but he is such a superb officer and good person that I thought it was important for you to
take consider him seriously. Please let me know if you need any additional information. I have know Alex for 35 years,
so I am sure I can answer almost all questions.

Hope all is well. The Secretary is doing a great job.

Bill Danvers
