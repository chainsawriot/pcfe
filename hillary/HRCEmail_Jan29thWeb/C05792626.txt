As you'll be hearing from ISAF, an Afghan NDS officer pulled the ripcord on a vest in front of coalition guys loading a
helicopter. Total of 14 either killed or wounded -- some US, some Afghans.

Right now, we think 1 US mil killed and one wounded.

                                                                                                                          1.4(C)
                                                                                                                          1.4(D)
                                                                                                                          B1
