By way of follow up

I will get you the info on How many images were taken by Foreign service and how many military.

We need help getting a coffee at the WH on the morning of Nov 30th to recognize the 12 winners of the photo contest
(best in show). Approx 100 people.

We have Secretary Clinton hosting the lunch Nov 30 At the dip room but we would be so GRATEFUL if she would stop by
at the evening event( the Art Happening) at the Kogod Courtyard at the Portrait Gallery. She could come any time after
8:30 and 30 minutes would be great. The event is from 8 to 11.

And lastly, I would love to be of help her in her future endeavors.

You are the best
Thanks so much!
B
