Dear Madame Secretary:

More than 3 month after reachina historic summit agreements on September 27,
                                        Squabbling over security
                and deepening unease and dissension in each country have kept the two more at
loggerheads than cooperation. Ethiopia's Prime Minister Hailemariam, along with Thabo Mbeki,
                                                                                                                        1.4(D)
convened another summit January 4-5                          But
                                                                                                                        B1
uncertainties remain. Armed clashes have fortunately remained few and far between,
                                                                           Another set of meetings
between the political and military chiefs that begins January 13, and the AU Summit at the end of
January present         the next best opportunities to make progress.

Summitry is not enough.




AUHIP Returns. Mbeki had Withdrawn from active mediation after the summit,
                                               I appealed to him to come back into the situation
                                                                                  The January 4-
5 summit, which he and Hailemariam arranged, appears however to be a triumph of process over
substance,
                                                                                                 1.4(B)
                                                                                                 1.4(D)
                                                                                                 B1

                                                                                                     1.4(B)
                                                                                                     1.4(D)
Next steps. As laid out to me by Mbeki, the Joint Political and Security Mechanism is scheduled to Bi
meet o/a January 13-14

                                                                            that agreement will have
                                    January 12-13.



            Before the JPSM meeting, as Mbeki has asked, I will write to President Kiir indicating our   1.4(D)
hopes and expectations of results                                                                        B1
                                                                                                         B5


Other Matters.




                                     We will host a donors meeting on South Sudan here in
Washington January 18 to review what can be done through the IMF and IBRD, as well as by "new"
donors such as Japan.
