NONE!! First off we can't take TARP money and the ones that have paid it back have said no - Goldman, Morgan Stanley,
and JP Morgan Chase. Judging from the chats w my friends at the banks, I think they all got together and decided not to

In the last two days we recd $1M from Fed Ex, $2M from VISA and $3M from P&G. That gets us to $41M. I think we are
close to another $9M. EB and I had a good chat w McGraw-Hill today.

Just saw Sean Woodward and heard you were mtg with the Irish parties in the am. He was quite distressed after their
