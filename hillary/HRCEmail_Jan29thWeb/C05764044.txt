Lots of accolades for you in SFRC today. Kerry was really engaged in the hearing and described VAW as a serious matter
of national security.
He was pleased about your taking the issue to the Security Council and clearly would like us to do more with DOD, etc.
Will work on that. Asked how we were doing in addressing this in our Iraq and afghanistan strategy. There were many
powerful statements about how no peace process or counterinsurgency strategy can work without women being part of
the strategy.
We also have to push the UN to name more women as negotiators and mediators.

Berman Commends Security Council for Adopting Resolution to Protect Women in Conflict
Situations

Washington, DC -- Howard L. Berman (D-CA), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, released the following
statement concerning the vote in the U.N. Security Council today concerning the protection of women and children in
conflict:

"I commend Secretary Clinton and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice for their efforts to secure passage
of this resolution, which calls for the appointment of a Special Representative to lead efforts to end conflict-related sexual
violence against women and children, and the establishment by the Secretary General of a targeted team of experts to
work with governments to prevent sexual violence in conflict.

"Today's resolution is an important step on the path to progress, but it serves less as a sign of work finished than as a
reminder of how much remains to be done. Congress will continue the hard work of building sustainable programs to
address conflict-related violence against women and children, both through encouraging continued engagement with the
United Nations and through our ongoing efforts to overhaul the U.S. foreign assistance system in the United States."
