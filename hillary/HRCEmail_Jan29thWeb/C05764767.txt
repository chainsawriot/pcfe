Re: Your speech and meeting on Monday


I have not seen your speech obviously that you will deliver Monday morning at Stormont. Shaun tells me that
it's a good speech, and you're right not to instruct the parties what to do but to encourage them to address why
completing devolution needs to be done.
                                                                                                                   1.4(D)
                                                              That's it.                                           B1
