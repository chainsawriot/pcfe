SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED




BUDGET/CONGRESSIONAL ISSUES




      Jack reported that he will meet Chairman Obey this afternoon. No real agenda, but will encourage him to make
leaving the State Department in good shape part of his legacy.




•   The timeline for the Supplemental remains unclear, but we are unlikely to have anything before Memorial Day.
More likely is the prospect we will have something by July 4.

MANAGEMENT ISSUES




•     Pat indicated that the incident on board the Delta flight from Japan to Minnesota yesterday apparently involved
two Chinese nationals who boarded without passports. The problem clearly involved boarding procedures in Japan, not
the travel documents themselves.




•    Business Week will come out with its annual survey this week of the best employers. State Department will rank
2nd as the best employer for Liberal Arts graduates, and 6th as the overall best employer. Only the FBI, among federal
agencies, ranks higher.




PUBLIC AFFAIRS




     PJ said he thought we had done well on the Iran front yesterday.




      A number of right wing bloggers are charging that Michael Posner "apologized" to the Chinese about the Arizona
immigration law in the course of the Human Rights Dialogue. It's not true and PJ will appear today on Fox to make clear
that Posner (and Sandra Day O'Connor) had raised the law as an example of how a democratic system deals with
controversial issues.




LEGAL AFFAIRS




     Harold reviewed the Supreme Court decisions from yesterday, noting that Justice Kennedy had cited international
precedents in the Juvenile life imprisonment case and that the court majority had cited the decisions of other nations in
determining that ne exeat rights are custody rights under the Hague Convention.
