Subject: 14 pts

Below are my notes on Dennis' 14 points, which involve 6 parallel steps each and then #13 and 14 are combined, joint
action by the two sides.



*ISRAEL*
1. Israel should offer voluntary compensation to settlers to leave the West Bank. (NB not unilateral, part of orchestrated
interaction) 2. Build housing now within Israel to show you don't intend permanent occupation.
3. Only build future settlement housing within the blocs - not beyond them.
4. Open Area C to economic activity for Pals. Just 120k pals live there, but -- alongside Jewish settlements-- all the rock
quarries are there, and Pals have no access.
5. Increase Palestinian police presence in Area B, and increase their areas of responsibility.
6. Work out security criteria to limit incursions into Area A.

*PALS*
7. Put Israel on their maps
8. Acknowledge historic Jewish connection to the land and to Jerusalem.
9. Stop incitement / de-legitimization. (No more hiding behind local officials on this).
10. Condition your public for peace. (ie returning to Arafat's "peace of the brave" rhetoric).
11. Start building permanent housing in camps for refugees.
12. Make major investments in rule of law/anti-corruption efforts.

*BOTH*

13, 14. Youth on both sides should have an exchange of classrooms. Create a forum for kids to be together. "Dialogue
of the deaf" right now.
