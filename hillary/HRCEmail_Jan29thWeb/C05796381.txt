Agree completely                               and the salubrious effects of distance from DC!
                                                                                                                     B5


Best to you          -H

Sorry I wasn't much help on secure conference call today -- wonders of modern technology.

I talked subsequently to Wendy and Jake, and think where you came out on                 subiect is exactly rieht.




Hope you've had chance to relax a little. It's so nice being away                     -- puts DC in better perspective.

All best,

Bill
