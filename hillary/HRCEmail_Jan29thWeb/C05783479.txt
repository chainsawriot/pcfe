UN Information Center

UNSMIL proposes an hour-long meeting with Ian Martin and team (DSRSG George Sharpentier, chief of staff HansJoerg
Strohmeyer, and Senior Political Advisor Muin Shareim). UNSMIL would like to discuss engagement with the TNC,
including a strategy for ensuring the TNC stays in the lead while also ensuring that the international community can help
the TNC make progress on priority issues; and the ways that UNSMIL can support the activities called for in UNSCR 2017.
(FYI: UNSMIL is very concerned about overlap with the POE due to UNSCR 2017.) UNSMIL would appreciate a heads-up
on any particular issues our visitor would like to raise with them.



3:50 -4:30pmEn route Mass Grave Site



4:30 -5:15pm Mass graves site visit: UNSMIL also suggested that the delegation visit a mass graves site. They suggested
that this would be a good way to show concern for human rights issues in a non-confrontational way, and noted that
this public show of concern for Qadhafi-era abuses would probably make any tough messages regarding current human
rights issues (such as minority rights and national reconciliation) go over a bit more smoothly. The Embassy has been in
touch with the head of the national commission for the search & identification of the missing and is confident he could
arrange a very good program that could include meetings with former prisoners, families of the missing, and the visit to
a mass graves site. The Embassy could also invite an NGO that is working on these issues, to bring in a civil society
element. The Embassy will visit a potential site tomorrow and send back more details afterwards. The Embassy thinks
this is the best option for your sole non-meeting event.

12:45 — 1:30pm Tour of Mercy Corps' civil society resource and learning center

    o Mercy Corps has agreed to host a civil society roundtable and light snacks (assume this will take the place of a full-
on lunch, which would eat into your schedule, so to speak). As it happens, there will be an exhibition at the center the
day of your visit that showcases videos and photos produced by participants in an OTI-funded project on strategic
comms/reconciliation. Envoy's Office is gathering more info on the exhibition, which will be unveiled to the public later
in the evening. The roundtable need not be related to the exhibit — let us know what you would like the focus to be, and
we'll identify the participants (ie, women activists, or a hybrid of women/democracy/HR activists).

1:45 — 2:30pmBriefing from engineers from the Libyana Company in the Benghazi Data Center soft switch facility (the

 o As for the telecom hacker-heros, Khalid Mufti will not be in town during the visit (in fact, he's in London
now). However, he has offered to arrange for his team to meet with the delegation and show them what they did to
salvage the comms in eastern Libya during the revolution. The site would be the telecom building in Benghazi, which is
on the way to the airport from downtown and would therefore be a convenient stop at the end of the day. (Site visit
still pending)
