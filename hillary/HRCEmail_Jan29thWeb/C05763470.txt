 Re: N. Ireland forum at CGI


 1. Shaun Woodward, UK Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, suggested a panel at CGI to be
 conducted by former President Clinton of British and Irish prime ministers, and perhaps leaders
 in NI, under the theme of "Implementing Peace."

 2. Former President Clinton has conveyed to me his approval, contingent on approval of the
 State Department.

  3. I have copied below (and attached) Woodward's letter to me.

  4. Let me know to move this forward.



  Dear Sid,

  Following our conversations about the CGI, it would be good to try and
  explore further now with President Clinton and State the idea for an event
  at the CGI for Northern Ireland.

  As you know, and very much thanks to the help again of HRC, we hope to be
  able to move forward with the final phase of the political process in the
  Autumn.

  As the CGI coincides with the UN meeting and also the G20, we should explore
  the idea of whether we could bring together and participation of both the
  British and Irish Prime Ministers under the auspices of the CGI. The theme
  could be 'Implementing Peace'. The session would explore the steps for the
  peace and political process in NI and obviously a session could have wider
  application into say the Middle East peace and political process.

  To take this forward it would be helpful to explore this with President
