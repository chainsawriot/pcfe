'In principle" doesn't mean much but the Secretary should be aware of this report. It may fit with Mbeki's plan that the
parties resume negotiations August 22.

Just checked with Lamamra and the new time is 3pm. Last night Lamamra indicated that Bashir has agreed in
principle to a face to face meeting with Kiir. There is a news report in the Wall Street Journal saying the same
thing about Bashir.

                                                                                                                                        B5
