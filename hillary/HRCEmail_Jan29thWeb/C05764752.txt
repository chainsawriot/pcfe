    Mr Brown visited Moorfields in London, one of the world's best-known eye hospitals, after surgeons
    found two small tears in his retina.
    The disclosure comes just two weeks after Labour Party chiefs were angry with the BBC because
    Andrew Marr, the presenter, questioned the Prime Minister about his health, including his eyesight,
    during an interview.

    Mr20Marr asked Mr Brown if he has been taking prescription drugs after rumours spread on the
    internet that he was dependant on painkillers or antidepressants.
    Mr Brown talked on the programme about losing the sight in one eye following a boyhood rugby. "I then
    had exactly the same thing happen in my second eye. I had the same retinal detachment. I had the
    same fear that therefore I might lose my sight in that eye," he admitted.
    In a carefully-worded statement, No 10 said today: "This summer Mr Brown had his annual eye check-
    up which was fine. Later he had his retina checked.
    "After examinations, surgeons found that the retina had two minor tears. However, as there has been
    no further deterioration, and no change in his eye sight, they decided against further operations.
    Yesterday [Friday] Mr Brown visited Moorfields Hospital as part of regular c hecks on his eyes and this
    check was also fine.
    "Mr Brown wants to thank the doctors and staff of the NHS particularly Moorfields Hospital. Were there
    to be any change, he would of course make a further statement."

 After the Andrew Marr Show late last month, senior Labour officials accused the BBC of smearing the
 Prime Minister. However, the BBC defended the tactics and a spokesman said: "Andrew was asking a
 legitimate question about the health of the leader of the country." The spokesman refused to be drawn
 on whether Mr Marr and Barney Jones, the editor of the programme, had consulted executives at the
 BBC before deciding to ask Mr Brown whether he was taking prescription medication.
 Later Lord Mandelson, the Business Secretary, said it was "absolutely ridiculous" to suggest the Mr
 Brown had a problem with pill use, and he blamed politically motivated bloggers for raising the
 possibility.
 "We have seen out there on the internet, the blogosphere, all these extreme right-wing people trying .to
 put these smears and rumours about, all completely groundless," Lord Mandelson told GMTV. The
.BBC received more than 100 complaints about Mr Marr's line of questioning on the day the show was
 broadcast.

I'm about to see Shaun--any messages? And have you heard the news about Gordon's
eye? What does it mean?
