Dear Secretary Clinton,

I was heartened to read your forceful remarks about the US commitment to the Asia-Pacific region this morning. On
Monday, our office held a workshop for the NIC that highlighted the downsides associated with an American withdrawal
from the region. I will be providing you with our report from that event. Also, in early June, we are holding two
workshops with US policy makers (one for Democrats and one for Republicans) to illuminate how contingencies in
Pakistan might affect US-China relations. I will give you a read out on those events as well.

Anne-Marie was in touch last evening to tell me that she had looked into the possibility of working with LTSG and found
that unfortunately her office would not be able to do so. Happily, Michele Flournoy's office is reaching out and has
asked me to participate in a wargame next week for the QDR, which I hope will help build the foundation for a contract
between her office and LTSG.

I am extremely grateful to you for helping me find opportunities to serve our government. As ever, I will keep you
posted. Thank you again, and yrs, Jackie
