Jake / Kurt / Philippe,
Want to make sure you have the latest, in case S gets asked.
We will, of course, hold these individuals accountable.
No recommendation yet on whether SD needs to calls his Japanese counterpart.

Jeremy/Wendy,

The latest from NCIS

•     This memorandum informs you of the arrest of two USN Sailors by the Okinawa City Police Department (OPD),
Okinawa, Japan, on suspicion of kidnapping and raping a 27-year-old Japanese national female.

•        ADAN Christopher Browning and AE3 Skyler Dozier-Walker of VR-59 (USNR unit based in Fort Worth, Texas) have
been on temporary duty in Okinawa. At about 0350 on October 16, 2012, the Sailors reportedly followed the woman to
her residence and then forced her to a nearby parking lot. According to information from OPD, ADAN Browning and AE3
Dozier-Walker strangled her until she became unconscious and then took turns raping her and stole her purse.

•        ADAN Browning and AE3 Dozier-Walker were apprehended by OPD on October 16, 2012, and remain in jail. A
third USN Sailor, AWF3                   was detained and questioned by OPD. He was released after an NCIS search of   B6
his off-base hotel room revealed no incriminating evidence.

•        AE3 Dozier-Walker admitted involvement to OPD, and a portion of the incident was captured on CCTV video.
Content of the video has not been released. ADAN Browning, AE3 Dozier-Walker, and AWF3 Minyard have no previous
arrests.

the victim.

•       Local media and Internet outlets are reporting details of the arrest and investigation.
