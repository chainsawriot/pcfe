Under Baucus' proposal (which has never been put down in legislative language), the co-ops, as defined, are to
be not-for-profit. Here are his criteria:


1. It must be organized as a nonprofit, member corporation under State law.

2. It must not be an existing organization that provides insurance as of July 16, 2009, and must not be an
affiliate or successor of any such organization.

3. Its governing documents must incorporate ethics and conflict of interest standards protecting against
insurance industry involvement and interference.

4. It must not be sponsored by a state, county, or local government, or any government instrumentality.

5. Substantially all of its activities must consist of the issuance of qualified health benefit plans in the individual
and small group markets in each state in which it is licensed to issue such plans.

6. Governance of the organization must be subject to a majority vote of its members (i.e., beneficiaries).

7. As provided in regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), it must
operate with a strong consumer focus, including timeliness, responsiveness, and accountability to members.

8. Any profit must be used to lower premiums, improve benefits, or for other programs intended to improve the
quality of health care delivered to members.

But the "system" let the Blues go public. What's to prevent the co-ops from incorporating down the road? The return of
non-profits would have to require no changes.

The problem is that Baucus circulated his plan Saturday morning, and his plan has included coops literally for months. He
started circulating paper that got to us Sunday. It's hard to move Baucus on anything new at this point, especailly now
that we're back to the hands off approach. And really, people are worried about non-profit insurance companies being
strong enough. After all, the old Blues became the current Blues - that has been a concern about coops too; that is why
the left has argued for a stronger government role.

But look our strategy just went 180 degrees in the course of 12 hours, so it could switch up again.

Why don't they go w non-profit insurance companies instead of cooperatives like the Old Blues?

So after being prepared to put out very long press paper, with a fully drafted bill (though still needing work) waiting in the
wings, the strategy has utterly shifted to going back to discussing health care at 30,000 feet tomorrow evening because
Baucus is moving. He will announce tomorrow he is marking up next week. They are thinking their push has made him
move so now it's counterproductive to lay out very specific details. The speech is being totally redrafted, and I think we
may just end up putting out a one-pager.

The Baucus news is close hold; as is, of course, all of this.
