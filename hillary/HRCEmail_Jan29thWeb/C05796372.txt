Huma,
I'm attaching the photos we'd like to use for a slide show for wh.gov (which state of course can also use).
Can you make sure you guys are okay with these photos. We have not toned these or captioned them yet; if you sign off, we
will send you toned files with captions for your usage too.
We will also send you a CD with lots more photos.
Thanks Pete
