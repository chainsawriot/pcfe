Robert Ford sent the following impressions this morning:

48 hours back on the ground, I am struck by how negative major developments here are:

                                                                                                                           1.4(D)
                                                                                                                           B1
     Asad pushes forward minimal reforms to quiet international critics;

     Very grim situation in Hama;

     Impending assault on Deir Zour;

    Harsh operations in and around Damascus, including Syrian govt shootings of protesters in restive Sunni districts of
Qabun and Medan, 15 minute drive east and south of embassy, respectively.

I had a long meeting with Turk Amb after the August 6 Muallim meeting with Damascus dip corps and will send quick
cable on Aug 7 about that. Per the Turk amb, the Turkish govt perceives that Asad "is at war with the Syrian people."

From Embassy Ankara:

Erdogan made a strong statement at an iftar dinner last night saying what was happening in Syria is an internal matter
for Turkey, that Turkey's patience was running out, that Turkey cannot be a bystander to events in Syria, and that
Turkey's next steps would depend on Syria's response to the message that Davutoglu would deliver on Tuesday "in a
determined manner." This is being reported open press.
