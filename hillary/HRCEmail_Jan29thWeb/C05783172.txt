Subject: RE: Ban meeting with Abbas

I spoke just now with the Palestinian Observer Mansour (their PR equivalent). He was in the meeting with Abbas and
Ban. I asked for his take on where things are heading.




We agreed to keep in touch.

-SG may see Abbas immediately after his speech to the GA on Friday.       He believes Abbas intends to
