Pakistan

    •   New York Times reporter Eric Schmitt is about to run with a story on Pakistani export control violations, based
        apparently on briefings to the Hill.

                                                                                          In the subsequent regional

        stronger export controls for Pakistan.

U.S.-EU Summit

    •   Derek noted that the U.S.-EU Summit in Washington is tentatively scheduled for November 2-3, which conflicts
        with the Forum for the Future in Morocco that the Secretary has already agreed to attend. Derek added that
        Phil Gordon is attempting to shift the Summit dates slightly to allow the Secretary to participate in at least part
        of the Summit.

Afghanistan

    •   Harold raised today's New York Times article on allegations that former Afghan Defense Minister and likely new
        Vice President Marshall Fahim has been involved in drug trafficking and had been subject to Leahy vetting under
        the Bush Administration could raise not only public relations but also legal issues. Harold indicated he would be
        looking into the legal ramifications.

Honduras

    •   The action memo to the Secretary on assistance to Honduras has still not come forward. Derek noted that he
        hoped to have the joint strategy memo on elections to the Secretary today.

    •     PJ said that he anticipated more questions about Honduras and whether the Secretary will attend Senator
          Kennedy's funeral and/or burial.

Regional Bureaus Meeting Highlights

Israel's Qualitative Military Edge

    •     Ellen Tauscher noted that the Majority leader had spoken to Defense Minister Barak about the QME report and
          had used our points. Jim said he thought Israeli concerns were less about the report itself than about the issue
          of F-15 sales.

Colombia DCA

    •     Jim told WHA he thought references to "transnational crime" in connection with the Colombia DCA were not
          helpful — they raised yet again the idea that this might have a regional focus. He asked that this term not be
          used.

Counter-Narcotics Money to Venezuela

    •     Jim questioned WHA's proposal to offer counter-narcotics funding to Venezuela, questioning whether Venezuela
          would accept our money and how this would play on the Hill. He asked WHA and P to take another look at this.

Australian Energy Project

    •     David Goldwyn briefed on the Australian Government's approval of a large liquefied natural gas project on
          Barrow Island involving a number of innovative environmental mitigation efforts, including underground carbon
          storage capture.

Sri Lanka




EAP Issues

    •     Indonesia — Curt Campbell said that the Indonesia stop for the President's Asia trip is "in trouble" because of
          scheduling. He said he would send a note to the Secretary on this, urging that she intervene.

                                                                PRM and 10 agreed.

   •      Korea -- Curt asked Jim to host a meeting before next Tuesday's DC on Korea to make sure that before Steve
          Bosworth goes out to 6-Party capitals, we actually have something to say. Jim agreed.

    •     Senator Webb — Curt reported that Scot Marciel had met with Senator Webb for a de-brief on his visit to
          Burma. Jim said he would like to pay a call on Webb as well.
