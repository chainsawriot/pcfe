Yesterday, we moved our wheels up back from 3:30p wheels up to 3:15p to give us an extra few mins of pad.




That said, if you all prefer, we can leave a little earlier to be safe. Shall we leave the house at 2:15pm and plan to be
wheels up at 2:45pm?

Hi, Everyone--

Bill told me last night he wants to be sure he's not late. Should we leave 30 minutes earlier--wheels up at 2:45 instead of
3:15? Or do you think he'll be ok w existing schedule?

One worry I have is that Service may freeze traffic on roads to Terry's which could stop you all from getting there on
time under current schedule.

What do you think?
