Subject: Break out the champagne

Dear Madame Secretary:

As you have probably heard at 4:00 pm the presidents assembled to sign(and signed) the several agreements.

Allison Lombardo will provide details of the agreements and remarks by the presidents. I will provide you a summary
report on the negotiations later today.

Thanks to all in the White House, Department, USUN, USSESS, and all others who supported this process.

Now pardon me while I go downstairs and drink a glass of champagne.
