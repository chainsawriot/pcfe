Spoke to Syr FM for about 10 mins early this am. Conveyed very directly msg we had earlier passed via Perm Rep in NY
and Czechs, reinforced by public comments from P and S.

FM listened carefully, and replied essentially along lines of MFA public statement earlier this week : "we will not use
CW, if we have them, against our own people ... we urge you to stop these allegations ... if you really care about the
Syrian people, you'll change your attitude toward what's going on in Syria ... there is no reason for you to keep making
these allegations unless you have a hidden agenda." He repeated these themes at some length.

I reinforced the depth of our -- and international -- concern. I urged him and others in the regime to take very seriously
what P said at NDU. I said we have no hidden agenda -- we have a profound disagreement about what's happening on
the ground, are committed to the real transition in leadership that the Syrian people want and deserve, and will
continue to warn forcefully against any/any use of CW.

FM said he understood message clearly, and would convey. He was subdued and less combative than in our
conversation last July over the same issue.
