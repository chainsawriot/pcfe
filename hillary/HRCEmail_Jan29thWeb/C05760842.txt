I recently returned from a CODEL to Haiti
and since the Secretary is travelling there shortly wanted to share a few thoughts:

The CBC worked for years before Aristide was taken out of office to have funds released that had been approved by the Inter
American Development Bank. The US was the main obstacle to having those funds released and so the embracing of democracy has
not lifted the condition of the Haitian people.
And once again the world seems to be waiting on us. Chairman Conyers promised to bring the President to Haiti, but Secretary
Clinton will be a great sign of our support.

The government seems to be looking for somewhere aound $1.5 billion from donors (am not sure President Preval and the PM are on
same page on this). This is the amt I gleaned from discussions with the pres who said their losses from storms in 2008 were about
$lbil.

President Preval' priorities. Are roads, electricity and investing in agriculture in 3 areas he has identified. The PM speaks more of
schools and healthcare which are also big needs

Elections are next week and as of when we were there Lavalas had no candidates. To the best of my understanding there are 3
offshoots all wanting to participate under that banner and the leadership is not clear.

This is perhaps info you already have.
I am very happy to see that Secretary Clinton is going and I hope this will mean increased and sustained support. We all felt that the
Haitian government is in better shape to handle funds and invest where needed.
Ambassador Sanderson was great while we were there.
