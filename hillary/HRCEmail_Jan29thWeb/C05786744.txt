There's no talking in beach ball. It's unlike any diplomacy I have seen. Any possible topic or reference or poet or Irish
lymric or historical reference or 60s pop culture data point can appear with little or no warning. Entertaining but
unpredictable.               Classified by DAS, A/GIS, DoS on 01/29/2016 — Class: CONFIDENTIAL — Reason: 1.4(D)
