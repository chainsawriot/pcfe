UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05790831 Date: 01/29/2016




                                                                                       RELEASE IN FULL

 Dear Henry,

 I appreciate the time you took to craft a letter as a follow-up to our conversation in Munich. I
 believe, based upon the information Pat Kennedy and Margaret (Peggy) Grafeld have shared
 with me, we can reach a commonality of understanding that provides a way forward to address
 your goals in a reasonable and efficient way - both for the Department and for you.

 Like you, the Department shares your interest in making available the doCumentation of your
 tenure as Secretary of State to scholars, researchers, and members of the public. To achieve that
 end, the Department reviewed for declassification the millions of pages of paper records and
 telegrams in its files documenting U.S. foreign policy during your tenure as Secretary, including
 more than 200,000 pages directly related to your actions as Secretary of State. All of these
 historical records then were transferred to the National Archives (NARA), our Nation's
 repository for historical records.

 More than 90 percent of these 200,000 pages of records have been declassified and are publicly
 available either in paper at NARA or online via the interne. Since this significant body of
 historical records is available to the public, Department officials have recommended against
 undertaking another review of the duplicate set of these materials that currently resides at the
 Library of Congress. I understand Ms. Grafeld has recommended to your lawyers that we will
 assist you in leveraging the completed declassification work at NARA of all your State
 Department papers including assisting Yale's efforts to copy the declassified paper records and
 to establish links with the online collections as the foundation for scholarly research both at Yale
 and the Library of Congress.

 Because the entire collection of permanent State Department paper records — more than 200,000
 pages — directly related to your actions as Secretary were transferred to NARA, I understand
 from our team that none of these records now remain under the Department's control. Of these
 200,000 pages, 185,000 pages were either originally unclassified or are now fully declassified,
 with the remainder withheld primarily for other agencies' equities in the Department's records.
 Our declassified records at NARA are the most accessed agency collection by researchers and
 members of the public from around the world. Leveraging the declassified State Department
 records at NARA will provide you with the foundation for your legacy collection for Yale or for
 substitution at the Library of Congress, consistent with your interests.

  I do want to address directly two matters you reference in your letter: your request to the
 Department regarding enforcing document handling arrangements you made with the Librarian
 of Congress and the Archivist of the United States executed in 2009, and your request regarding
 accessing papers related to your tenure as National Security Advisor. I am advised that the
 Department was not consulted regarding the final 2009 agreement that you reached with the
 Library of Congress and NARA; for that reason, Department officials are not in a position to
 address or seek enforcement of the assurances they may have made regarding their treatment of

 the copies of the more than 200,000 pages of Department records you provided to them.
 Similarly, as Mr. Kennedy and Ms. Grafeld shared at our meeting, the Department also is not in
 a position to address documents that cover your tenure as National Security Advisor.

 I welcome providing support to you and your team using the readily available records at NARA.
 And I look forward to hearing from you how we might best assist you in this regard.

 Sincerely,



 HRC
