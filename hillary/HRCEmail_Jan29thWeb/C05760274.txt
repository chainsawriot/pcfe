Roll Call is reporting that Republican Congressman Joseph Cao may vote in favor of the final bill if Rep. Stupak's abortion
amendment passes. You'll recall Cao defeated Rep. William Jefferson.

I've been told                     hat the count isn't terribly firm, but they're still hovering around 217-18.

Politico is reporting that Rep. Lipinski is a NO which contradicts what he told Secretary LaHood.

The vote is expected around 9 pm this evening, although that timing could be sliding.

I'm not sure if you're interested in these kinds of updates, but there was just a testy exchange between Boehner and
Rangel on the floor over the Stupak abortion amendment.

4:54 PM ET -- Rep. Rangel to GOP Leader Boehner: "Shame on you."

Minority Leader John Bbehner (R-Ohio) and Rep. Charlie Rangel (D-N.Y.) just got into a testy exchange when Boehner
asked Rangel if he would guarantee that pro-life language in the House version will remain in the bill through conference
committee with the Senate.

"You've been here long enough to truly understand how this system works," Rangel responded, saying that he couldn't
guarantee him anything. Even if he could, said Rangel, such a guarantee "might be a violation of our ethics laws."

From there it heated up, with Boehner saying that allowing a vote on the amendment was a "shell game" because the
party planned to remove it later. "Shame on you," responded Rangel, with one of the more direct insults you'll see on
the House floor, where speakers are supposed to direct their comments to the chair, not directly to other members.

The other member                 targeting is Scott Murphy (NY-20). I didn't commit you to anything since I'm unfamiliar
with the nature of your relationship with him.

Murphy has some bigger hurdles. He's currently a "NO".
