SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED

Legislative Affairs

Rich noted several items:

             •   The Kerry/Lugar Bill on Pakistan has passed the Senate and is expected to be adopted by the House via
                 suspension (requiring a 2/3's vote) on Wednesday;
             •   General Jones will brief all Senate members on Wednesday on the status of the Afghanistan/Pakistan
                 review. Jack Lew may go along;
             •   Richard Holbrooke was scheduled to brief members of the Democratic Policy Committee on Thursday,
                 but there is a possible conflict                    Rich and Cheryl agreed it made most sense to defer
                 this rather than risk being late;
             •   Rich said no to the SFRC request for the Secretary to testify on Af/Pak on October 7, but there is still a
                 pending HFAC request for Holbrooke to testify the same day. Cheryl indicated we should let them know
                 that since things are in flux, it would be premature;
             •   The House has passed a Continuing Resolution. Hopefully, the Senate will do so on Tuesday or
                 Wednesday;
             •   Senator Dodd has scheduled a hearing on Iran Sanctions for October 6, despite our message that this is
                 not the best timing. Stuart Levey of Treasury has agreed to testify. Jeff Feltman will likely represent
                 State.

Public Affairs

    •     PJ said that reporters are chasing a Karen DeYoung story indicating that there was a consensus at the Friends of
          Afghanistan meeting at UNGA that Karzai has won the Presidential election.

    •     PJ also anticipated questions about the arrest of Roman Polanski in Switzerland on the basis of an outstanding
          U.S. warrant.

Assistant Secretaries Meeting

Management Issues

    •     H1N1 — Pat encouraged everyone to prepare for a possible H1N1 outbreak and ensure that proper procedures
          are in place to enable key employees to work from home.

    •   End of Fiscal Year — Pat noted that the end of the Fiscal Year is Wednesday, adding that managers should spend
        their remaining funds well and wisely.
    •   Continuing Resolution — Pat noted that we would likely be on a CR starting Thursday, reiterating that this meant,
        in essence, no new programs and initiatives for the time being.
    •   High Stress Assignment Outbriefs — Pat said he had heard disturbing reports of managers refusing to allow
        eligible employees to attend the high stress assignment outbrief. He said this was unacceptable and did not
        want to hear this report again.

Afghanistan — Friendly Fire Incident

    •   INL reported a friendly fire incident outside a checkpoint near Kunduz when a local employee employed by an
        INL contractor was apparently shot accidentally.

Israel QME

    •   PM noted that a large Israeli delegation will arrive on Wednesday to discuss the report to Congress on Israel's
        Qualitative Military Edge.

Human Rights Council

    •   10 reported that there will likely be a vote Friday on a resolution on the Goldstone Report. What is not yet clear
        is whether we will be able to support the language.
