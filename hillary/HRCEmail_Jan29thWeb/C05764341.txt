Re: Latest/N. Ireland


After five hours of talk at Downing Street tonight, Thursday, October 8, Shaun Woodward tells me that it seems
Gordon Brown has brokered a financial package with Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness that may in turn
break the deadlock on devolution of policing and justice. They have covered the major issues in stage two in
their discussions. On Monday, Brown will formally set out the details in a letter to Robinson and McGuinness.
Gordon will share these with you when you meet with him on Sunday at Chequers. Shaun says that both
Robinson and McGuinness, subject to some minor details, should be in a position to recommend to Unionists
and Nationalists that this is a strong deal. The letter will confirm the details.,
                                                                                                                 1.4(D)
                                                                                                                 B1




hope that's right.
