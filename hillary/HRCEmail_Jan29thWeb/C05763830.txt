Subject: DRIVING CABLE'S DAY

DRIVING CABLE'S DAY -- Stephanopoulos: 'White House officials have talked privately about whether to use the Clintons
more on health care. You saw President Clinton go out and speak to the left -- progressives -- at [the Netroots Nation
convention in Pittsburgh this weekend] ... There have also been discussions about whether to deploy Secretary of State
Clinton. No final decision on that yet.'
