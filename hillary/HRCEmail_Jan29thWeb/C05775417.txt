Subject: GOVERNMENT FORMATION END OF DAY STATE OF PLAY

I OR ONE OR ANOTHER OF THE USF-I/EMBASSY TEAM HAS BEEN IN TOUCH WITH ALMOST EVERY ACTOR TODAY IN ALL
CAMPS. TO PROTECT SOURCES IN THIS CHANNEL I WILL BE GENERAL.

THERE ARE FOUR BASIC 'LINES OF OPERATION' IN PLAY NOW, SOME NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. BOTTOM LINE IS THAT
THIS WHOLE PROCESS HAS ACCELERATED DRAMATICALLY.

1. Constitutional Court decision to call back the parliament and form a government in accordance with the constitution.
This is a potentially dramatic step. While it might have been manipulated by or play to the current government, reading
the decision which I have passed back to most of you indicates how far this country has come towards a rule of law
world view. It basically says that the parliament can't arbitrarily decide that it won't form an executive. Parliament
probably will be called into session next Monday or Tuesday.                                                                    1.4(D)
                                                                                                                     If he      B1
does not, my assumption is that voices will be raised--given the logic of the decision which is compelling--to call for a
new election as the legislature elected this time would not have after eight months carried out its obligatory function to
form a government even after a constitutional court decision--that's only my interpretation but just wait.)

As the parliament in its first session is supposedly to select a speaker, and then within 30 days select a president who
can then task the biggest vote-winner (itself controversial now) to form a government, theoretically the 'winning'
coalition--as yet not formed--will have to work out all of these posts--and others besides--before the first vote--for the
speaker--is made. (i.e, no one will vote for a speaker without knowing who else gets what later.)

2. Iraqqiya-Kurd alliance? Iraqqiya will march in full strength                                                up to Irbil
on tuesday. From what we have heard Iraqqiya is willing to compromise on all Kurdish concerns except Presidency--
can't blame them for that--and article 140--they want more general language, I'm sure something like 'all relevant
articles of the constitution' can work. This will provide a real counterweight to 'rush to annoint' Maliki.

3. Iraqqiya-Maliki Outreach: Signs some of this is going on. If it can bring in all of Iraqqiya—excellent. If it only affects
defectors, not good. More tomorrow on high side.

4. 4X2:




We will go to Erbil on Wens following Iraqqiya meeting up there to take lay of the land and in particular sound out on
the Presidency question.

Iranian Issue: Dominates much of the thinking here. Cable will be in tomorrow AM. JJ
