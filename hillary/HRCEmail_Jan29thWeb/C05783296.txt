Cheryl,
See note below.

Raj in World Bank Meetings. He will call you and Tony when he gets a break.

I wanted to flag for you given Secretary's need to make remarks tomorrow.

Message is important and Margie will need to send to Cheryl as well.

If possible it would be good to have Raj email Tony Lake to confirm he received the message and for Margie to email
Cheryl to alert the Secretary.
