Subject: Somali Prime Minister Resigns (SBU)

(SBU) Prime Minister Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed said he had resigned, complying with the Kampala
Accord agreed by the president and parliamentary speaker June 9, according to press. Embassy Nairobi
comments Ugandan President Museveni, who was the guarantor of the accord, sent an envoy to press the prime
minister to live up to his commitments. Further pressure came from a June 19 meeting at which fourteen of
eighteen cabinet ministers told the prime minister he must step down.
