Gordon has an annual test on his eye because he can see through only one. It has two small tears in the retina, nothing
serious. The media made an issue of his health, Andrew Marr host of the Sundat BBC show asked two weeks ago if he
took antidepressants, a Tory inspired rumor. Gordon said no and he and his people were infuriated.

I'm about to see Shaun--any messages? And have you heard the news about Gordon's eye? What does it mean?
