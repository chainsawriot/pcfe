Subject: Secretary Clinton Tonight in Dublin

Hi all,

Philippe asked me to send you the below excerpt from the Secretary's press conference
following her meeting with the Taoiseach tonight in Dublin (about an hour ago).

QUESTION: ... coming from some Republicans in Congress who accuse her of not having the
necessary qualities that a Secretary, a prospective Secretary of State, should have. Do you
feel that this criticism - or how deeply do you feel that this criticism has wounded
her? And should she be nominated and it turns into a protracted battle in the Senate, how
long would you be willing to stay on?

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, first, Jill, let me repeat what I have said many times publicly and
privately. Susan Rice has done a great job as our UN Ambassador. She has been a stalwart
colleague in a lot of the tough decisions that we've had to make, and certainly with respect
to defending our national interests and national security at the United Nations. And she's
played an important role in what we've been able to accomplish in the last four years. I
worked very closely with her in shaping the sanctions on North Korea and Iran, and she has
been on the go for us in every way that was required.

And it's important to remember what Susan said was based on the information that had been
given to every senior official in our Administration. And she made very clear in her
appearances that the information was subject to change as more facts were gathered and
analyzed by the intelligence community. And look, as is often the case, our understanding
evolved over time, and we've done our best to keep the American people and the Congress
informed. That was her goal, that was her mission, and she should not be criticized for
doing exactly that.

And this decision about who succeeds me is totally up to the President, and of course, I will
support whatever he decides. And I've told him that I will certainly do what I can to help
to expedite a transition, but I'm not going to make any comment beyond that.

Thank you all.
