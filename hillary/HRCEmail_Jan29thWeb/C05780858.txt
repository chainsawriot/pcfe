MS -- I believe Claire gave you a final copy of tomorrow's schedule. Just wanted to mention that we squeezed in a very
quick drop by with the Iran Watchers in the D Conference Room in the morning. NEA felt it was important to do esp this
year with so much going on in the region. Also, the policy meeting is on China and will include State as well as about 6
outside folks -- their bios should be in your book tonight. Finally, the PC tomorrow at 5:15pm             Thank you!      B5
