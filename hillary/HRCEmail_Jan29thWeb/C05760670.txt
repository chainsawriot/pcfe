My sources tell me that the Modernizing Foreign Assistance Network is now ginning up a letter to the President
complaining about the delay in appointing an AID administrator and an MCC head and arguing that it shows a lack of real
commitment to development. They will presumably make the same points that they made in their letter to Jack in mid-
March and the public letter they put out..
