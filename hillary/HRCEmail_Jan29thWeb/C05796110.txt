Subject: Call to President Banda

I'm sorry for the late email but we just received a call sheet for Malawi President Banda.

Are you open to taking this at 7:30am tomorrow? If so, we can reach out overnight. Otherwise, we will find other
widows that work tomorrow for you.

This did not make it with the pouch but we can ask Marina to print this and her bio for you if a 7:30am call works for
both you and President Banda.



The Secretary's Call Sheet for Malawi President Joyce Banda



(C) Purpose of Call: To offer condolences on the passing of President Mutharika and congratulate President Banda on
her recent swearing in.
