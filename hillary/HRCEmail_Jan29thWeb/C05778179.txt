Here is rough transcript from the SecDef-Tantawi conversation:

Tantawi: I'm glad to hear from you. -

SecDef : Thanks for taking my call; know it's a busy time; want to talk about the situation. I'm calling in the
context of the 30 year friendship between our militaries.-

Tantawi: Yes, I understand; thanks for everything you do for us. -

SecDef : I'm concerned about the recent events; want to echo President Obama's call for all sides, protestors
and government alike, to exercise restraint and refrain from violence.-

Tantawi: We are working on it, trying very hard to avoid anything else [other than
restraint]-

SecDef: Excellent. My view is that the Egyptian Armed Forces, especially the army, have a close bond with the Egyptian
people. Important that nothing happen to break that bond or discredit the army in the eyes of the people.-

Tantawi : Yes, it is a very tight bond. You saw it on TV today. We will do our best to handle things peacefully and
calmly.-

SecDef: Good; how the army conducts itself will affect the future of our
relationship. Can you give me an indication of the situation as you see ittoday. -

Tantawi: We [the military] deployed yesterday and we' re doing our best to cover
everything. I expect tomorrow to be better than today. People have confidence in the
army. -

SecDef : I agree. What guidance have you given to the troops? -

Tantawi: I told them don't use force. Work with the people as your friends and your                                      1.4(D)
family. We won't use violence against our people.-                                                                       B1


SecDef: That' s good news. I have a specific concern about the safety of our embassy and
two requests.




Tantawi: Dr. Gates, I'm aware of the embassy situation and
                 Be assured we will take care of everything.
                                                                                                                      1.4(B)

SecDef:     OK, let's leave it there for now. We'll wait to hear from the ambassador [Amb Scobey] based on your
                                                                                                                      B1
