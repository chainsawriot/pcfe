Re: Latest on NI from Shaun Woodward


Below find Shaun's latest account of the state of play in the nev_otiations and his suggestions about future
action,                                                                                                        1.4(D)
                                                                                                               B1
On NI:                                                                                                         1.4(B)

1. I have them back at the table again - for the moment anyway! Very arduous
meetings with each through the week and on Thursday ( 26th Nov ) bringing
them ( separately ) back to GB ( he's brokered twelve meetings since
September between them ) and what in effect now amounts to the 'Glienicke'
strategy.

2. Each side has a major ask ( " a. date" and "parades process" plus both
have an administration issue on the relationship between the Justice
Minister and the Executive itself ); so now I am trying to develop with each
( working through Irish Government ) two 'in parallel' policies (pieces of
paper!) which in ten days time we may be able to exchange.. This would then
just leave the Administration issue, which may be straightforward or become
the last sticking point. Seems straightforward, but of course anything but.

3. The absence of trust is critical. Indeed it is the critical problem. Sc
in essence, British and Irish Government trying to 'lend' trust to each to
enable the paper policies ( sequence of dates leading to transfer; and a
process for parades which can be supported by the unionist community - those
who parade - and also nationalists - those who protest )

4. In all this the role of US Administration remains critical. Both sides do
but also are obliged to trust the Us Administration. And they do trust ERG
because the people of NI trust her very much! ) See it again as a bridge
metaphor with a line to cross. Keeping SF at the line; encouraging DUP to go

to the line and then to keep walking once we reach the possible moment to
cross The Havel!

                                                                                                     1.4(D)
                                                                                                     B1
                                                                                                     1.4(B)




7. Also Reg Empey remains stubborn; the Tories can claim to be playing a
straight bat on this, but in effect because Cameron is not putting any real
muscle behind how he hits the ball to Reg, it is a pretty impotent




7. And then there is the problem of the dissidents.. Much happening here.
Last week the attempted murders of policeman and the bomb at the Policing
Board HQ. Both failed; however the latter, had it gone off properly, would
have destroyed the building and could have killed scores.There is much more
here but this needs to be face to face.




9. HRC office proposed Tuesday 1st December, but as of yesterday morning I
am now bringing the two Prime Ministers , plus ROI Foreign Minister and
myself together at Downing Street on Monday evening (30 November ) . It
would therefore technically be impossible to get to her for Tuesday ( 1st
December ) midday as I will need also to present to Cabinet on Tuesday
morning. So Lou S is trying to get a date when HRC returns from NATO
Friday, Saturday, Sunday 4 - 6 ) in either DC or New York, whichever is
easier for HRC.
