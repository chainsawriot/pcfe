SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED

        I missed the meetings this morning, but Kin Moy provided the following readout of the two, very brief,
meetings:

Public Affairs

    •   A/S Campbell will do the rollout of our Burma policy at today's 1:00 press briefing. H will make Hill staff calls to
        provide background.

    •   The Secretary will make remarks on CTBT today that will generate media interest.

    •   The media would be interested in. New York-based (UNGA) issues and the unfolding events in Honduras.

Legislative

    •   H said Afghanistan benchmarks are due to the Hill today, as required by statute.

    •   H noted that the Defense Appropriations Bill would go to the floor of the Senate next week. Heated arguments
        are anticipated with the McCain, Graham, and Lieberman camp quoting from the McChrystal report in
        questioning the Administration's Afghanistan policy. H suggested that the Administration needs to engage the
        Hill as soon as possible as a preemptive move. Members of Congress would very much like a briefing on the
        process and H indicated even a one page background paper would be very beneficial to their needs.

    •   DG Nancy Powell will testify in the Senate today on developments in the Foreign Service. H convened a murder
        board yesterday and the hearing is expected to go smoothly. M said that one tricky question might refer to the
        recent GAO criticism that we are not providing enough language training to officers before they depart for their
        assignments in the field. Our response is: 1) this is a function of resources, of which we do not have enough;
        and 2) we are offering more language training than ever (the language season that began a couple of weeks ago
        at FSI boasts a record number of students).

    •   M also said Robert Hormats was sworn in yesterday and is now traveling to Pittsburgh. Michael Posner will be
        sworn in today and then depart for Geneva, where he will join Harold Koh in discussions at the Human Rights
        Council on the Goldstone Report.

    •   L assessed that the State Security rollout received a positive reception in the media. D Steinberg, however, said
        the rollout seemed to leave unclear whether additional legislation might be sought. L replied that the media
        articles he read correctly interpreted that there would be no push for legislation on holding detainees.

Regional Bureaus Meeting

Highlights:

    1) Honduras
              •   We are working on a charter flight for Insulza, et.al.
              •   Getting the Zelaya and Micheletti folks to talk has been tricky.
              •   U.S. tourists are generally not in capital and those Amcits who are in Tegucigalpa are being assisted by
                  embassy.
              •   On the ground, the intensity of the situation has diminished because of the curfew and the large
                  number of security patrolling the streets.
              •   Our mission is fine. We have backup generators that are fully functional. Brazilian Embassy situation is
                  not good, but we are providing some assistance to them.

    2) POTUS and VP Travel:
          • POTUS likely to travel to Copenhagen October 2 for IOC meeting and engagement on climate.
          • VP likely to go to Romania, Czech Republic, and Poland (dates unspecified)
