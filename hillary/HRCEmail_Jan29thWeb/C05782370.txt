Statement by President Clinton and Secretary Clinton

Passing of Geraldine Ferraro

Gerry Ferraro was one of a kind -- tough, brilliant, and never afraid to speak her mind or stand up for what she believed
in -- a New York icon and a true American original. She was a champion for women and children and for the idea that
there should be no limits on what every American can achieve. The daughter of an Italian immigrant family, she rose to
become the first woman ever nominated to the national ticket by a major political party. She paved the way for a
generation of female leaders and put the first cracks in America's political glass ceiling. She believed passionately that
politics and public service was about making a difference for the people she represented as a congresswoman and
Ambassador.

For us, Gerry was above all a friend and companion. From the rough-and-tumble of political campaigns to the important
work of international diplomacy, we were honored to have her by our side. She was a tireless voice for human rights and
helped lead the American delegation to the landmark Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995. Through
it all, she was a loyal friend, trusted confidante, and valued colleague.

Our thoughts and prayers are with Gerri's husband John, her children and grandchildren, and their entire family.
