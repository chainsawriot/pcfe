Miguel, we should be - and are - thanking you for your help.

And I'm not surprised about Chuck. At his core he's a good man. A good man who is just so
happy she left the Senate.

First, thanks for letting me tag along today. Always fun.

Thought I'd share a quick note.

Kerry met with Schumer this afternoon to discuss Kerry's nomination. We were waiting in
Kerry's front office where they had the TV tuned to HRC's HFAC hearing. Schumer couldn't
stop raving about HRC's performance and stamina. He kept talking about her appearance in the
morning at SFRC and how she commanded the proceedings. Even as he was walking out of the
room, he kept saying, "I can't believe it... look... she's still going!"

He seemed sincerely impressed.
