Criag (who was heroic and drafted the compromise language used as the basis for the agreement), sent this out last
night.

To Ambassadors and DCMs:

As you will have heard, the parties reached a deal in Honduras late Thursday night. In advance of more formal talking
points, please draw on following points Tom did for the Secretary. Please underscore that the Honduran negotoiating
teams did a superb job, supported by their leaders. We were pleased to work closely with them over the last two days.

Throughout the crisis we we worked closely with the OAS and friends in the region. Please encourage host govts to
support the Honduran elections now that there is a Guaymuras agreement.

Also, please underscore that S played an active role from the very beginning, by her key role in helping launch the San
Jose process, to meeting with and calling key leaders (including Zelaya and Micheletti more than once). She also took
the risk of sending a team to Honduras against long odds this week.

Many thanks to all for your support throughout. Particular kudos and thanks for Amb. Llorens, DCM Henshaw and their
excellent team for four months of skilled and tireless work. USOAS under Lew Amselem did an outstanding job as well.
WHA/CEN under Chris Webster and DAS Bisa Williams -- worked round the clock producing huge amounts of excellent
work. WHA Press devoted long and productive hours as well.

Of course, the work is not done. Implementation and preparation for elections will keep everyone busy. But all who
contibuted to this success should take a moment to enjoy it.

Best,

ck

S can announce the breakthrough. She should say something like:

-- I welcome news of a breakthrough in negotiations in Honduras.

-- I congratulate the Honduran people, President Zelaya, and Mr. Micheletti for this historic agreement.

-- I also congratulate Costan Rican President Oscar Arias for the important role he played in fashioning the San Jose
process, and the OAS for its role in facilitating this successful round of talks.

-- I cannot think of another example of a country that, having suffered a rupture of its democratic and constitutional
order, overcome such a crisis through negotiation and dialogue. This is an a big step forward for the inter-American
system and its commitment to democracy as embodied in the Inter-american Democratic Charter.
-- we were proud to be part of this process, and commit ourselves to working with Honduras as it prepares for elections.
