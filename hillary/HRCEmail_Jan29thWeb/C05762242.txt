I understand from Harold that HRC and Reid already spoke â€” Harold thought that might have been on
Thursday night. If so, no need for an additional call. If not, we can get her slightly updated points for a call
next week.

Reid staff          say Reid is poised to file cloture on Harold, but may not be till 2"d week in June.            B5


Reid also said he doesn't need to meet with Koh personally. Reid is on board with trying to do everything he
can to get him confirMed quickly.
