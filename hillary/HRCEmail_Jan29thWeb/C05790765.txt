Subject: readout of call with Ryabkov



U/S Sherman spoke with Sergey Ryabkov for about 15 minutes Saturday morning, working nearly all the way
through points on P5+1 preparations for Moscow and the IAEA BOG meeting June 4-8, but the call was
dropped near the end and could not be reconnected.

Ryabkov began by saying Moscow was anxiously working to prepare on modalities and press and other issues
and would email an update soon. He continued by updating Sherman on his conversations
