What's the deal with the      Strategy announcement?                                                                    B5

Definitely connect with her -- we typically do this through the NSC.

I am not aware that there is going to be a       trategy announcement on Sudan so I also want to connect with Jim who   B5
is overseeing Gration's efforts at the Dept. He also may be able to help.

We (P.I +) met today to talk abt Sudan and how best to support Amb Gratian and tie the support to the potential Sudan
WH strategy announcement in late june. Need to hook up with OPE to find out the list of folks they are connecting with
who are focused on Darfur so that our messaging and outreach strategy are coordinated.
Sorry to be so long winded.
Tina Tchen is Director of OPE and didn't know anyone from main State had relationship

Thanks dear!

We don't have a WH Liaison for State b/c our interactions go through the NSC.

What do you need? You can be the one to establish a relationship if there is a need you see going unmet.
