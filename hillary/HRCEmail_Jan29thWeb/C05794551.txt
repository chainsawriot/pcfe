Subject: Request for the Secretary to speak at the 2012 African Youg Leaders Summit in DC

Cheryl:      Sorry to bother you on this, but as the Secretary's schedule starts to fill in June and as AF struggles with the
schedulers to try to get a few additional minutes of her time on Africa related issues, I wanted to make an early pitch to
you see if you would support a request for the Secretary to speak at our June African Youth Innovation Summit. This is
the third in a series of major events aimed at reaching out Africa's young leaders. In 2010, State hosted and the          ,
Secretary spoke at the beginning of a weeklong event for some 75 young African leaders. The week culminated with a
90 minute town hall meeting hosted by POTUS. The entire week was fabulous. In 2011, the First Lady hosted a meeting
of some 60 young African women leaders from across Africa in Johannesburg. This year's event, which has been closely
coordinated with the White House, is a continuation of the Administration's strong outreach to Africa's next generation
and is intended to be one of the Administration's signature programs on engaging Africa's young leaders.

This year's program will include a group of 65 young entrepreneurs from every African country; they will participate in
the Innovation Summit from June 13-15 in Washington, then spend 10 days in several U.S. cities paired with American
corporate/NGO mentors, and come together for a concluding session in Chicago June 28-29.

In making this request for the Secretary's time, there are two issues. One is that the Secretary has already agreed to
speak to leaders at the AGOA Forum which is scheduled during the same week. The second is that the Secretary's
speech to the young leaders would be outside the building at the Palomer Hotel in Dupont Circle.

I ask for your support on this request because this is an important event and will be seen as a part of the
Administration's and the Secretary's strong commitment to Africa's next generation of leaders.

If she is able, the best dates for the Secretary's would be on June 13 (afternoon or evening), June 14 (anytime) or June
15 (anytime).

Thanks for any support you provide on this, Johnnie
