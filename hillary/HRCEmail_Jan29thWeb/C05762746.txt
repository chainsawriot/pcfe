Many thanks.          is definitely ready to do this, and I know Cheryl and Nancy are following up.

I sent you a separate e-mail on the Chinese and Iran, prior to your Yang call.
                                                                          Will join Jim and Dennis in meeting with Tom
and Susan today, and keep you posted. Bill
