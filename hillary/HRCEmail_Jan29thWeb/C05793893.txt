Subject: RE: Msg from Erdogan to POTUs: HAMAS msg

I've spoken to Amidror and Barak in the last hour, following up on POTUS's calls yesterday, and conveying the message
from Frank.

Without getting into too much detail, I would say that both 1) appreciate the President's effort to engage with PM
Erdogan and President Morsi on this; 2) recognize the opportunity represented by today's consultations in Cairo; and 3)
will try to give it enough time to see if it can succeed in producing a stable ceasefire.

They will obviously be looking for some signs of goodwill from the other side to determine if any proposed ceasefire is
real -- they note that they observed a pause during PM Kandil's visit to Gaza, whereas Hamas et al fired dozens of
rockets during the visit, so they are wary. They are in direct contact with the Egyptians, of course, and have had some
direct contact with the Turks.

Amidror was not enthusiastic about the notion of a "US guarantee" of Israeli action. While being clear that Israel would
not violate any terms it agrees to, he worried that the US would be blamed if anything happened that led to a
breakdown of the ceasefire. He did not rule it out, and was not giving an official answer, but he considered it unwise.

Subsequent to my previous email, Sinirli confirmed he had spoken w/ WB overnight, and asked if we had got IS
response.

I feel safe in assuming that WH wishes to pursue this, but I am unaware what messages may have been passed to IS in
other channels overnight.

**** OPS Ctr pls alert appropriate seniors ***

Erdogan advisor called just now in advance of 1030 wheels up for Cairo, asked to convey following                   He
said Sinirlioglu was to try to pass to Burns but uncertain whether had done:

-- following PM-POTUS telcon, PM had spoken overnight w/ "the people in Gaza" + Morsy, who also agrees to work w/
"Gazans."

-- "gaza" ready to stop missiles in return for "US guarantee that Israel will stop all operations."

   Erdo asks earliest US response in view of dangerous situation @ Gaza. He + Morsy will resume efforts from Cairo this
afternoon.

-- I asked that Erdo pass read out of his talks w/ Morsy to Anne Patterson.
