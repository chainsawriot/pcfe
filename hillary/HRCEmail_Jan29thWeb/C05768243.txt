This is from Laura Rozen's blog this week.



A senior official told POLITICO this week that a draft of the interim QDDR is completed and is being internally
circulated."We are waiting on the White House" to finish up its interagency policy review on foreign assistance to
release it, the official said, adding that officials are anxious to brief on the QDDR. The official thought the interagency
policy review being run out of the White House could take at least three more weeks.
