Subject                          Final Proposed Version of Gates/Mullen Memo
Attachments:                     2010-05-9 nonpaper re Gates Vision.docx



Attached and below is a memo drafted to address the competing visions of development and in particular, the
role of State/USAID. It was drafted before we sent the memo on the PSD.


I'm not certain it still has applicability as a separate memo though providing it to Gates and Mullen to see if
they agree and if so, they provide additional support for the vision


After you review, let me know your thoughts on whether and how we should deploy it.
