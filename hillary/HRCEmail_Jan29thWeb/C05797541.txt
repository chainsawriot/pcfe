Al -

This is one of those notes I wish I didn't have to write. But I do. Because even though I'm trying to let more roll off my
back these days, your item is so egregiously inaccurate, deceptive, and nonsensical that I can't bite my tongue.

Your numbers are off by a magnitude of 20 to 30. Not merely off by 20 to 30. By a MAGNITUDE of 20 to 30.

When you saw those numbers you honestly believed that Secretary Geithner has only been there 40 times in 40
months? Or Secretary Clinton 33 times? No alarm bells went off? It completely flies in the face of common sense. They
aren't tourists who have to produce a drivers license when they go through the visitors center. They are cabinet
secretaries who come and go constantly. Whatever methodology you relied on is about as accurate as saying that
President Obama has never left or re-entered the White House because it's not logged in WAVES. And your inadequate
parenthetical caveat makes me think you knew something was off. I don't even understand what "variant of their
names" means. Someone's habitually misspelling Clinton a Crinton, or thinks her full name is Harriet Clinton?

I'm left wondering why you just didn't ask for correct numbers. If you had, I would have told you that through
yesterday, Secretary Clinton's number is actually 681. Now, to be fair, it's possible that 642 of those times she left the
building, told us she was headed to the WH, but went to Starbucks instead. She's slippery that way. But discounting
that possibility, you're off by a factor of 20. If your own *factchecker* reviewed this item, you'd be lucky to get off with
only three dozen Pinocchios.

So I'm sure the Post, in an effort to adhere to your own lofty standards, is anxious to correct the record here - either
formally, or in your next column - to address this gross deception of your own readers.

If that's not the case, please do let us know as I'm sure another outlet - such as Politico - would be interested in writing
about the true facts.

White House guests
By Al Kamen
Washington Post
Wed, May 23, 2012

If access is power, which Cabinet secretary has it — and, perhaps more interesting, which doesn't?

In The Washington Post's database of the White House visitor logs, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta shows up as a visitor
to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue the least. One reason is that he has been on the job for less than a year.

And we should note that the database covering guests to the White House complex doesn't show us every visit (these
bigwigs most often get waved in, or their visits might be logged under a variant of their names).

Moving up the list, Energy Secretary Steven Chu shows up on the logs a mere 14 times — and he has been with
President Obama from the beginning of his administration. Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki has dropped by no
more than 18 times during Obama's tenure, the logs show, and Interior Secretary Tom Vilsack and Transportation
Secretary Ray LaHood each clock in at 21.

Attorney General Eric Holder is the most frequent Cabinet-level guest, according to the database, logging 42 visits. He's
followed by Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner at 40 and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton at 33.

Make an interesting finding of your own while searching through the visitor logs? Let us know on Twitter with the
hashtag #whitehouseguests.
