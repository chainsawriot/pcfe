Colleagues,

The information below is a summary of the latest GLOC developments provided to the Watch by Embassy Islamabad. In
short, seven containers are en route to the Torkham border, bringing the total number moved to eleven. Embassy
Islamabad will meet with government officials July 13 at the Pakistani Ministry of Defense to finalize the MOU. PM
Ashraf's instruction to move cleared U.S./ISAF/NATO cargo immediately is making its way to action officers to effect.

Ambassador Munter met with Prime Minister Ashraf, who was joined by Foreign Secretary Jilani, Defense Secretary
Sethi, Ambassador Rehman, and MFA Additional Secretary Babar. They told him 1,579 pieces of U.S./ISAF/NATO cargo
was to be released immediately. Embassy Islamabad received the attached diplomatic note, note applies to cargo that
was cleared and issued No-objection Certificates (NOC) prior to the November 26, 2011 incident, within an hour of the
meeting's completion. Ambassador Asif Durrani from the Presidency confirmed this with DCM Islamabad and added
remaining cargo should be cleared by Ramadan (i.e., by July 20/21).

Post estimates the likely break-down of the cargo as:
   • 1,031 U.S. military cargo
   • 151 pieces of diplomatic cargo (awaiting confirmation)
   • Remainder should be ISAF/NATO cargo (post has asked ISAF to confirm)

77 containers of books for the Afghanistan Ministry of Education should also move immediately —the paperwork for
these containers is complete but awaits NLC scanning & inspection. Post relayed this information to the MFA, which
said it would work on this cargo July 12.

In addition, the Kajaki Dam containers should also move immediately. Ten need Customs to issue the "release
authorization" to leave the port, after which they must be scanned. For the remaining five -- the clearing agent is Astro,
but post has had virtually no contact with them or information about them. They are not a clearing agent used by
DOD. Demurrage charges must be paid, and the process has started, but is not completed.

Cargo movement: Four trucks (carrying seven containers) are en route July 12 to Afghanistan on the northern route and
should cross the border at Torkham 18:00 local time. Based on information from local staff in Peshawar these
containers were not scanned, but customs seals were checked and the containers were released. In addition, it appears
that yesterday's message that customs-cleared, NOC-issued cargo should move immediately is making its way to action
officers (at least at Torkham). These will bring the total number of containers moved to 11. However, no additional
cargo has moved from Karachi as the Pakistani government puts the finishing touches on procedures for scanning and
inspection. The MFA assured post that this written guidance is near-completion and might be issued before close-of-
business July 12.

MOU: The MFA contacted post saying it wants to present the MOU to the cabinet immediately. DCM Islamabad spoke
with Sohail Khan and Ubaid Nizamani (Director of the Americas) and told them that both sides should sit down together
at least once more to make finalize the MOU and ensure both sides agree to its terms. Post offered a video-conference
with the U.S.-based experts or in-person with an Embassy team. The MFA wants to meet July 13, in-person, at the
Ministry of Defense (16:00 local time). Pakistani participants will likely include Defense Secretary Sethi, RADM Farrokh,
and MFA representatives.

Ambassador Briefed Coalition Partners about GLOC: The Ambassador, DCM, and ODRP Commander briefed Coalition
partners about the GOP's July 3 decision to re-open the GLOC. They provided information about the GOP's July 11
interagency meeting that resulted in the decision to the cargo immediately and outlined the current status of the
MOU. Coalition partners asked about the events prompting the GLOC re-opening, CSF disbursement timing, retrograde
operations, measures to prevent another GLOC closure in the future, and GOP security provisions for cargo. All
expressed their gratitude for the briefing and welcomed the openness.
