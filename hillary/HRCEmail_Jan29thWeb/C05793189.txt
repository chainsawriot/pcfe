                                                    The announcement on the 31st of December by Said Jalili, the nuclear
negotiator, is a further indication of interest.




Taking advantage of this propitious moment to work with Iran to move the relationship in a more positive direction would
be valuable and a step back from the path to conflict. Yet such a step now would more likely be successful and even more
valuable if it were set in the context of a broader US strategy toward Iran. In order to move toward engagement with Iran,
Iran's Supreme Leader will have to be led to understand two central facts: (1) that working with the United States is
possible on a fair and equitable basis and (2) that US policy toward Iran is not based on "regime change" -- that there is a
genuine intention of the US to work with Iran toward a new relationship. It will take time and a number of actions by the
US to persuade the Supreme Leader. This will not be easy, but is the only apparent way to achieve our objectives with
Iran over the long run. War, as you and I understand, is simply not a viable option. And if sanctions are to serve their
purpose, then we must help to open the door which we want Iranians to walk through.

As we did last year, the small group with which you met stands ready to speak with you further about these opportunities
and our thoughts on how best to pursue them on the basis of long and continuing contact with Iranians who are and have
been close to the situation in their country and understand the approach of the leadership as well as the various factions
contending for influence in the country.

From my experience, I know something of what you have to contend with generally, and more specifically regarding Iran,
as well as the cost of missed opportunities and failed ones. Please count on our help and support as you address these
difficult issues and challenges.

I hope that the apparently revived interest in Iran in meeting with the P5+1 will lead to a contact and an effort to
determine seriousness.

With all good wishes for the New Year,


Respectfully,

Thomas R. Pickering.
