So after being prepared to put out very long press paper, with a fully drafted bill (though still needing work)
waiting in the wings, the strategy has utterly shifted to going back to discussing health care at 30,000 feet
tomorrow evening because Baucus is moving. He will announce tomorrow he is marking up next week. They
are thinking their push has made him move so now it's counterproductive to lay out very specific details. The
speech is being totally redrafted, and I think we may just end up putting out a one-pager.

The Baucus news is close hold; as is, of course, all of this.
