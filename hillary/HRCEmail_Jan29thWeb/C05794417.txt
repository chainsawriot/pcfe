Subject: Jihadi Forums feeling the Heat from CSCC's Digital Outreach Team
Importance: High



The following link is the Arabic text posted last night under the title "Important clarifications
for members of the Jihadi Forums) of a statement issued by the veteran jihadist media group,
the Global Islamic Media Front (GIMF). The statement, a backhanded measure of CSCC's
effectiveness, seems to have now appeared on multiple jihadist sites, not just those connected to
Somalia.

The statement seeks to reassure jihadist groups on news from Somalia, warns against
disinformation and confusion in the ranks, and seeks to promote greater support for Al-Shabaab
and for kindred groups fighting worldwide. Among the guidelines provided is the following
under point #2:

" therefore, we do not allow publishing any lying or not credible news on any matter related to
Somalia, and we advise our brothers not to be an aide to the digital outreach team that belongs
to the American State Department , which was assigned the task to ruin the reputation of Islam
and to discredit the Mujahedin everywhere."
