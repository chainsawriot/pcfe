Subject: Meeting w Kofi Anan

As Jeff knows, I met with Kofi Anan at his request in Geneva on May 24, 2012. The meeting lasted for almost two hours. I
had lunch afterward with Robert Dann, his Australian adviser (Robert normally heads up the UN Mediations Support
Unit).

Kofi wanted to see me to get a briefing on the attitude's of Syria's neighbors to the ongoing internal conflict. He
explained to me that there was no question in his mind but that Asad was finished but quite entrenched and that it
would likely take some time to remove him. The question he was focused on was how to affect a transition to a new
interim government in advance of elections for a new government.

Somehow he had to tamp the violence down first - he felt he was making some headway there (this was before the
Houla massacre) with the deployment of the UN monitors. He was eagerly awaiting the report from his #2 Jean-Marie
Guehenno who was arriving back from Syria where he had been preparing the ground for Kofi's next visit. He said that
he had only had a short phone conversation with Jean-Marie from which he understood that large parts of the country
were not under Asad's control.

Because the opposition was so divided and politically ineffectual, he wanted to develop a "variable geometry" approach
with those neighbors and outside powers who could influence both the regime and its opponents to persuade Assad to
stand aside and orchestrate as orderly a transition as possible. With this in mind, he had been speaking with all the main
players. He wanted to get from me an assessment of what the regional neighbors might be willing to do. We then
proceeded to do a "tour de region."

ISRAEL: He wanted to start with Israel, whence I had just come after meetings with Netanyahu, Dermer, Amos Gilad, Avi
Kochavi (new DMI), Amos Yadlin (old DMI) and a phone conversation with Amidror (who had just flown in from Beijing).
I told Kofi that they were united in assessing, like him, that Assad had no way back. He had lost all legitimacy. They
were also united in believing that                                                                                     B1

They were also                                                            Although they thought they had seen some     1.4(D)
cracks among the generals a few months ago, things had settled down and they now judged that for the time being
Assad did not have a problem with his army's support.

Nevertheless, as time wore on they were becoming increasingly                                                   They
feared that

                                   and therefore he didn't see what
for the time being.              also raised the memory of I

United States: I told Kofi that it was my understanding




                                                                                                        He welcomed
all that, said he had spoken to her about it and was planning to speak to Robert Ford, Fred Hof and Ahmed Salman that
afternoon.

COMMENT: Kofi is very much'in his element, back on the international stage and enjoying the action. He has brought
back many of his old lieutenants. I'm told                                                                                  B1

                   He did not come back to center stage in order to                                as his last act of
international statesmanship.

            Inherent in such a strategy is
            He will clearly use whatever opportunity he can to secure the united backing of the Security Council, but he
will be reluctant to go there if it leads to a divided house. That means he'll often be playing for time               in
the hope that something turns up that he can use to the advantage of his strategy. Before the                 he was
thinking of reporting in July on one particular issue in his six point plan that would
