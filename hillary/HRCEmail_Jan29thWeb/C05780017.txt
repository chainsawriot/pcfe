Subject: African Union demands immediate halt to Libya attacks (U)

(U) After a March 20 meeting in Nouakchott, the AU panel on Libya called for an "immediate stop" to all attacks after the
United States, the UK, and France launched military action against Qadhafi, media report. The body asked Libyan
authorities to ensure "humanitarian aid to those in need," as well as the "protection of foreigners, including African
expatriates living in Libya." It underscored the need for "necessary political reforms to eliminate the causes of the present
crisis" but at the same time called for "restraint" from the international community to avoid "serious humanitarian
consequences." The panel also announced a meeting in Addis Ababa on March 25, along with representatives from the
Arab League, the Organisation of Islamic Conference, the European Union, and the United Nations to "put in place a
mechanism for consultation and concerted action" to resolve the Libyan crisis.
