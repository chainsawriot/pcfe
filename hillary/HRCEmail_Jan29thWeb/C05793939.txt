Either over the weekend or Monday at the latest. House is expected to consider their version of the bill late next week.

For everyone's awareness, the House Republicans are opposing all anomalies unless they are absolutely necessary to
prevent something dire from happening. So, call to McConnell probably most useful since he's the most sympathetic to
our Burma policy.

State leg called over to say that they believe CR anomaly for Burma will be very difficult unless perhaps Secretary
Clinton were to call some combination of Boehner and McConnell. Since she has a lot of time in the air don't know if
there might be an opportunity to move forward.
