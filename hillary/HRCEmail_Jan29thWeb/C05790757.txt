Yes, its monday and tuesday bilats.
But you have to leave tuesday to get there wednesday unless you want to fly overnight. Airforce told me refuel but we
can go back. Let us work on this.

I thought the bilats were on Monday or Tuesday. Also, I flew--w/o refueling--from Los Cabos to Brasilia. But all this
depends on being in Rio on Wednesday

. From Todd today:

   Just got home from 7 hour train ride back from NY. Plenty of time to think. I'm sure these are tough scheduling conflicts
