                        unless I need to do otherwise. FYI, it takes about 45 minutes to mobilize car and driver
and to get to the Chancery.
                                                                                                                      B1
Here's how I understand it:                                                                                           1.4(D)




I will stay online with cell-phone at hand and will report any developments.

One further point: My recommendation                                                                                           B5
