Subject: Brussels/Iran


We finished our P5+1 meeting mid day today in Brussels without final
closure on proposal but headed toward agreement and an offer of a
December meeting in Istanbul. There was considerable desire for a
plenary chapeau that would give Iran a sense of our vision of the broad
end state as an oral message along the lines of the President's message
I delivered in previous Istanbul meeting. Such a chapeau to be delivered
in the plenary would have to include a bit more detail than previous but
would be a frame for the confidence step which would be under
consideration as first phase. In addition, Europeans took on trying to
outline a full road map for internal consideration including conditions
for lifting sanctions and end state.
There was also agreement that when we do reconvene, experts should be
present so that after PD level openings, technical issues can be
addressed and an iterative political-experts process undertaken. Ashton
also made clear that if we got traction- not widely anticipated- that
all would need to stay for as many days as necessary.
As a process matter, the consolidated proposal ad ref to governments
(attached) which we are bringing back, must get agreement or issues
raised by Monday to assess whether Ashton can offer date to Iran in
December. This proposal builds on our paper and is consistent with our
guidance on demands and offers. It is our expectation that particularly
our Russian colleagues will want a sense of chapeau language before
finally agreeing. If needed experts agreed to another meeting in Berlin
on December 6 before a December round with Iran.
Finally, there was discussion about a P5+1 statement for the IAEA BOG
but more work to do to convince Rs and Cs though believe doable.
