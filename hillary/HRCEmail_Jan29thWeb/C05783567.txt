We wanted to send a heads up that we've heard Raj is planning to ask HRC to participate in the July event listed below
for the Saving Lives at Birth Grand Challenge to improve maternal and child health (which HRC helped launch earlier this
year). We're getting more information about this event and who else will be participating, but at this point we're not
sure that it rises to the Secretary's level.

Raj is also pushing for an event at CGI on Saving Lives at Birth to announce new commitments. Apparently he's already
mentioned this to HRC.

Let us know if you have questions and we'll keep you posted.

Thanks,
Rachel
