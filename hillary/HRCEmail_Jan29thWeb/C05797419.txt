     • Quality, quantity, and adequacy of intelligence activities;

     • Effectiveness of organizational structure, management, and personnel; and

      • Performance of all agencies of the Federal Government engaged in the

        intelligence policy.

  members to the Board. Members are selected from national security, political,
