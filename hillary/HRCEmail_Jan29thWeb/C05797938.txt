I was swelling with pride as I watched the boss today. As someone who has worked on the Benghazi aftermath; as
someone who had the privilege of working so closely with HRC for a brief time; as someone who knew Chris; as
someone who has served in a war zone, far from home and family and wondering if I would survive a year; but mostly as
a Foreign Service Officer. I was overwhelmed by her passion, her defense, and her unwavering support of the State
Department family that is my home.

It has been one of the honors of my life to serve not just HRC, but with all of you. Today was only the most recent
reason why. On behalf of the thousands of Foreign Service Officers who do "believe the United States is the most
extraordinary force for peace and progress the earth has ever known", I just wanted to say thank you.
