Sorry -- these emails came in delayed.

A few points:

1.              met with Kislyak who said that you would get full head of state privileges at APEC.                                 B5




3. I'm meeting with Wendy and Rexon later today on Syria.
                                                                         I will follow up.

4. The IMF is heading to Egypt, where the Egyptians will request $4.8 rather than $3.2 billion. Will keep you posted.
Separately,                                                                                                                      1.4(D)
                                                               But this bears watching.                                          B1

5. Today is the official end of the transition in Somalia -- there is some backing-and-forthing on seating certain warlords
in the parliament.

6. Dan Shapiro has sent a long missive                                                                It is worth a read and I
will get it to you. Separately, Michael Ratney has done a short piece


                                                                                                                            1.4(B)
                                                                                                                            1.4(D)




Off to meet with Wendy. More later.
