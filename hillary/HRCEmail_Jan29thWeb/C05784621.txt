Subject: 12/12 Erekat



Sa'eb Erekat called earlier today from Paris. Erekat had just arrived from Amman, where he met with FM Judeh.
Tonight he was to see FM Juppe and NSA Levitte; tomorrow Abbas sees President Sarkozy. (They are also lined up to see
Ashton in Brussels in Wednesday.)

                                                                                                                                1.4(D)
                                                                                                                                B1




Finally, Erekat said he would soon be in Washington for a CFR event on Friday and/or Saturday, and asked to see the
Secretary to follow up on the Jordanian idea. I                                                      said I'd pass along           B5
the request.
