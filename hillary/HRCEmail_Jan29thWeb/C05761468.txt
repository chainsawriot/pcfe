Dear Secretary Clinton,

I was heartened to read your forceful remarks about the US commitment to the Asia-Pacific region this
morning. On Monday, our office held a workshop for the NIC that highlighted the downsides associated with
an American withdrawal from the region. I will be providing you with our report from that event. Also, in
early June, we are holding two workshops with US policy makers (one for Democrats and one for Republicans)
to illuminate how contingencies in Pakistan might affect US-China relations. I will give you a read out on those
events as well.

Anne-Marie was in touch last evening to tell me that she had looked into the possibility of working with LTSG
and found that unfortunately her office would not be able to do so. Happily, Michele Flournoy's office is
reaching out and has asked me to participate in a wargame next week for the QDR, which I hope will help build
the foundation for a contract between her office and LTSG.

I am extremely grateful to you for helping me find opportunities to serve our government. As ever, I will keep
you posted. Thank you again, and yrs, Jackie
