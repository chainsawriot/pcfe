Wendy, Cheryl and Jake: Don Gips reports that Mandela's condition has deteriorated sharply and he could pass away in
the next few days. FYI South Africa Govt funeral arrangements call for a large ceremony ten days after his death.
Embassy Pretoria has also made administrative arrangements. Johnnie

I just talked to someone who was with the family today. They came away with the strong sense that it is now just a
matter of time and that if he leaves the hospital it will only be so that he can pass in his own home. It was unclear but
my read is that we could be talking about the next week.

The family also stressed that they are very much hoping POTUS will come to Qunu. While this is their desire it is unclear
how the SAG feels and it is also very clear that the logistics of such a visit would be next to impossible.
