Dear Mike,

I'm working on another national-security story involving some State Department cables, and was hoping you
could help, or point me in the right direction.

This story will report that the U.S. military (specifically, the U.S. Africa Command and the Navy) have been
deploying MQ-9 Reaper drones on secret counter-terrorism missions over Somalia from a base in the Republic
of the Seychelles.
       UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05783193 Date: 01/29/2016

The U.S. Africa Command had announced publicly in September 2009 that it was basing some Reaper drones
in the Seychelles as part of an anti-piracy mission. But several confidential State Department cables make clear
that the drones were also being used to perform counter-terrorism missions over the Horn of Africa and
Somalia, and that U.S. officials asked the president of the Seychelles to keep it secret.

Given that Wikileaks recently posted the remainder of its database of State Department cables to its publicly
accessible website, my editors have determined that it's no longer necessary for the Post to provide the State
Department with hard copies of the cables we are planning to cite in advance -- as we have done in the past.

Naturally, however, The Post would still like to get reaction or comment from the State Department for the
story. In the interest of transparency, the primary cables we plan to cite or publish are as follows:

09PORTLOUIS218
09PORTLOUIS271
09PORTLOUIS292
09PORTLOUI S397

(As you may know, the U.S. government does not have an embassy in the Seychelles; the nearest U.S.
diplomats are based in Port Louis, Mauritius)

I have already been in touch with the U.S. Africa Command and the Navy to ask questions about operational
details of the Reaper drone deployments to the .Seychelles.

But I did have some specific questions for the State Department that I was hoping you could assist with:

1) The cables state that a primary reason for basing the Reaper drones in the Seychelles was so they could
conduct counter-terrorism missions over Somalia and the Horn of Africa. Yet U.S. diplomats asked Seychelles
President Jean Michel and other Seychellois officials to keep this aspect of the program "discreet" or a secret.
Why did the State Department insist on the need for confidentiality? Was the publicly advertised anti-piracy
mission a ruse or a cover story?

2) One cable (09PORTLOUIS292) indicates that one purpose for the drone flights over Somalia was to supply
force protection to AMISOM (African Union peacekeepers) forces in Somalia, but that this particular mission
was not disclosed to President Michel because he did not ask about it.
  Did the State Department or other U.S. officials subsequently inform the Seychellois government that the
drones were being used to supply force protection to AMISOM troops?

3) Although U.S. officials stated publicly in 2009 that the Reaper drones were unarmed, the cables make clear
that the U.S. government was contemplating arming the UAVs. In fact, two cables reveal that U.S. diplomats
told President Michel that they would notify him in advance if they decided to go ahead and arm the Reapers
with missiles.
  Did U.S. diplomats or other U.S. officials subsequently notify President Michel that UAVs based in the
Seychelles would be armed? If so, when?

We have not fixed a publication date for this article yet, but it is possible that we will publish as soon as
Wednesday.

Thanks again for your help and patience with these queries..

All the best,
