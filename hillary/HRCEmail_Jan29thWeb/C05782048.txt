OSD plans to send this response to Reuters:

"On February 5, 2010, Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn submitted a report to Congress as requested in the
National Defense Authorization Act of FY 2010. At the time of delivering the report, the Department of Defense noted
that it was conducting a separate, classified study and offered to provide that additional information to Congress when it
became available.

"The report is the result of a lengthy analytic process to determine Taiwan's air defense capabilities and future needs.
The timing of the release is unrelated to developments in the U.S.-PRC relationship or other, similar considerations. The
report will be briefed to Congress after the interagency review process is completed.

"In accordance with the Taiwan relations Act (TRA), the United States makes available to Taiwan defense articles and
services necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability. Our determinations of potential
arms sales to Taiwan are based on an interagency review process. This document will inform that process. As part of
the TRA, we will continue to closely monitor and assess the needs and current and future threats. As a matter of policy,
we do not comment on potential arms sales to any military."



This response above gives far more information than State's current guidance:

•       In accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), the United States makes available to Taiwan defense articles
and services necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability.
•       As stipulated in the TRA, the U.S. government makes its decisions on what defense articles to sell Taiwan based
on Taiwan's legitimate defense requirements.
•       We continue to evaluate Taiwan's defense needs. No decisions have been made on potential arms sales to
Taiwan. We do not comment on potential weapons systems for foreign military sales.
•       We refer you to the Department of Defense for any comments on the Air Balance Study.

All,

I'm still awaiting OSD press guidance, but in the interest of time, I'm sending this to you now.

Please see the email below from Reuters' Jim Wolf (to OSD Press and PM Press) re: comments by Sen. Cornyn. Please
note that Reuters told OSD Press that they do not plan to write a story on this until early next week.

Separately, the Washington Post's William Wan contacted me today to request an interview to discuss the following:

1) Whether there was a request from Taiwan to be able to send a letter of request (a request for a request basically)
that was turned down by State and NSC?
2) Someone who could talk even if just on background about the diplomatic difficulty of this situation with China, Taiwan
and US military aide in light of what happened last time US did an arms sale with Taiwan, and what exactly is the official
State Dept's strategy or approach to the problem right now.
3) How to get out of this stalemate with Sen. Cornyn's office which is blocking Bill Burns' nomination over the Taiwan
issue.

Thanks,

Jay, Leslie,




I'd appreciate comment on a 16-month+ delay for a congressionally mandated report on Taiwan's air defense force.
Senator John Cornyn of Texas, speaking at the Heritage Foundation today (June 29), quoted Secretary Clinton as having
told him yesterday that the report was in an inter-agency review process that "may take another three months or so."




The reporting requirement was contained in the final version of the FY10 NDAA (conference report). Note the 90-day
deadline after enactment; the bill was enacted on Oct. 28, 2009. So, the end of January 2010 was the deadline, thus the
16+ months of tardiness.

I'd appreciate if you'd explain the reason(s) for the delay, which is partly responsible for Cornyn's hold on William J.
Burns' nomination to be deputy secretary of state.




Also, I'd appreciate comment on Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou's assertion that the Obama administration has been
unwilling to accept a formal letter of request (LOR) for F-16C/D aircraft. Why is the administration refusing or
discouraging Taiwan from presenting such a request?




The full account from the Taiwan president's office, excerpted below, is available here
http://english.president.gov.tw/Default.aspx?tabid=491&itemid=24690&rmid=2355




President Ma Ying-jeou met on June 24 with US-Taiwan Business Council Chairman Paul D. Wolfowitz and urged the
United States to sell Taiwan F-16C/D fighter jets. He said that this would help the ROC ensure its national security and
maintain regional peace at the same time that it is working to improve cross-strait relations.

The president stated that the relationship between Taiwan and the United States is crucial to the ROC's existence and
development. Even though the two countries do not maintain formal diplomatic ties, they have consistently maintained
close cooperation in the area of security, he said. For instance, in October 2008 and January 2010, US President George
W. Bush and President Barack Obama approved arms sales to Taiwan, helping to bring Taiwan's military hardware up to
date.

President Ma stressed that Taiwan's arms purchases are made in order to replace aging equipment, acquire defensive
arms, and buy hardware that it is unable to produce on its own. Even though Taiwan has been able to acquire several
arms packages over the past few years, its attempts to purchase F-16C/D fighter jets have not gone smoothly. The
United States has been unwilling to accept a letter of request for the aircraft from Taiwan, and has even hoped that
Taiwan would not submit such a request. Taiwan understands the sensitive nature of this request, the president said,
but added that the ROC's fleet of F-5 fighter jets is aging and the F-16C/D fighter jets constitute an indispensable
defensive weapon. This marks the 19th time that he has publicly urged the United States to sell the F-16C/D fighter jets
to Taiwan, and he reiterated his hope to see a breakthrough on this issue soon.




Thank you in advance,
