She did read it over the weekend and is tied up at the UN all day today. We are expecting to talk with her tonight so she
can discuss her concerns with us. Cheryl or I will follow up after that conversation. I do not know more than that right now.
Thanks.

What's the news? Did the Secretary have a chance to read it over the weekend? Any feedback?
