Subject: Wapo piece heads up

That bad wa po piece on afg avipa (ag stabilization program) is out tomorrow.

We have an aggressive response plan but the piece is v bad - made worse by the constant citing off the record of senior
officials that we believe is heavily one particular ex employee and the appearance of differences b/n mil and civ
perspectives.

I believe we should respond aggressively to explain the decisions we've made to make sure there are no gaps against the
civ mil plan, impleMent the apar guidance to make sure our programs leave durable/sustained gains, and highlight the
efforts to insist on evidence based program design etc.

Don/ben/alex and pa team are managing a response that will include an isaf statement etc and we'll have to make a
round of calls in the morning as well.

They will keep you up to date and welcome any guidance as well.

Raj
