Subject: Rio - update



All - the Israeli DPR, Haim Waxman, spoke with Amb Rice this afternoon. He said Israel can accept the kind on
compromise that we had been considering for Rio. SER described the idea the our lawyers have developed for an ad hoc
session (see L paper forwarded), which Haim recognized as a better possibility.

Haim said Israel would object in writing pro forma to preserve their position but not block it. When asked about public
comments, he agreed that Israel would not criticize us, which Amb Rice stressed was very important.

He also told SER that the GOI conveyed a similar positive response to our embassy (see request below).

Haim conveyed urgency to move fast before the Algerians (who have been leading on this) start something that is
irreversible (e.g. table an unga resolution). Haim has already spoken with the Canadians (rio co-chair), who will agree
with what is acceptable to the Israelis and also stressed urgency of moving fast if we are going to do something.

NEA/SEMEP - would appreciate if you can determine what has been conveyed to our embassy in Tel Aviv.

Subject: Rio +20 / Palestinian participation

All- We know that many of you have been working through issues related to Palestinian participation in Rio +20. State/L
- with help from USUN/L - has put together the attached paper that you will hopefully find helpful as you consider these
issues. As you'll see, the paper analyzes the proposal for Palestinian participation now on the table and suggests possible
alternatives. If any questions (or comments) please feel free to call or email. Thanks, Todd
