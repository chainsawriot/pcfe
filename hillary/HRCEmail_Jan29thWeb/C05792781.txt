Beasley called to say that FM Carr is embarking on a substantial effort with all ASEAN countries to urge them to
approach EAS meetings in unity on SCS issues.                                                                           1.4(B)
                           I thanked him for the update, and asked that Australia be in close touch with us in coming   1.4(D)
weeks.                                                                                                                  B1

Best,
