Hi, Tamera, Kris and KPK--

 I need your help in identifying a candidate           for this Commission which consists of three Commissioners. It is a   B5
Presidential appointment                                                                                                    B6

                                                                                                 Any ideas?

  Here's the description:

  The President has the authority to appoint all three U.S. Commissioners to the International Joint Commission. The IJC
is an independent U.S.-Canadian organization established by the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909. Its purpose is to help
prevent and resolve disputes relating to the use and quality of boundary waters and to advise Canada and the United
States on related questions.
