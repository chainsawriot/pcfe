Cheryl:

This letter follows up two conversations with the Secretary and has been sometime in the making. I would
be grateful as always for your assistance in getting it to her.

Sincerely and all good wishes for the New Year.

Dear Madam Secretary:

Following up our brief talk on Monday the 19th and our previous exchange at the Crisis Group dinner on Iran, I send you
these few ideas on how the Administration might take advantage of recent developments to further US interests.

I am attaching for your background two letters that relate to two aspects of our relations with Iran — (1) how we might
benefit from following up on the Iranian offer to discuss a cessation of enrichment to 20% in connection with providing fuel
elements for the Tehran Research Reactor and (2) how we might work toward better communications to avoid conflict by
accident or miscalculation.

Iran has raised again the option of ceasing enrichment of uranium to the level of 20% for use in the Tehran Research
Reactor (TRR) to produce medical isotopes. It seems clear that while Iran can produce material at 20% enrichment, it
cannot now and perhaps for some time manufacture the fuel elements which the reactor requires to continue operation.
The cessation of enrichment to 20% would be in return for a quantity of fuel elements. The arrangement holds out
possibilities for two areas of expansion — (1) getting Iran to contribute its already produced 20% materials to the project
and also (2) to agree not to exceed 5% levels of enrichment, the next level below 20% for which they have a putative civil
use. Even if Iran were not willing to contribute its currently held quantity of 20% enriched material, I would encourage
exploring the offer with the idea of seeking an agreement because the cap on enrichment at 5% is a solid step on the way
to our objective of a cessation and can be described as such, and the offer opens the possibility of further meetings on the
nuclear question now reinforced by the Iranian announcement of December 31°'
