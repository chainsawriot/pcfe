You don't need to read all of this. Bottom line is that there are a few outstanding issues but we feel like we are in the
home stretch on the MD negotiations.

Alice and Jake,

Further update. An IPC occurred earlier today and reached guidance on issues 1 and 2, but 3 requires a little more
homework on this end. A fourth issue has emerged on environmental matters and Pentagon is working. Potential Ad
Ref agreement as early as tomorrow, but could take longer.

Colleagues:

We made significant progress today on the text and are essentially down to three key issues: 1) Turkish
Homeland Security; 2) Termination and withdrawal; and 3) Radar installation infrastructure construction costs
beyond U.S. requirements.


The lawyers are also working a couple of other legal issues with State/L and DOD/OGC. We will let you know
if we can't resolve these issues at lower levels. We are meeting with the Turks again at 1:00PM
tomorrow. Request your response as soon as possible.

Thanks,

Frank

Admiral Hendrickson will work with the Turkish Generals to discuss what may be possible under U.S.
law. The Admiral, along with the EUCOM and MDA legal reps, are scheduled to meet with senior TGS
officials tomorrow morning at 10:00AM to hear their proposals, and to gain clarity on what they are seeking.
We will provide feedback on that discussion, but I don't think we will be able to resolve the issue at our
level. Senior-level engagement will likely be required to resolve this issue.
