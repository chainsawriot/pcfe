If you can slip it in, one more item this morning of relevance on the children issue:

Department of State and USAID have established an orphans and vulnerable children
working group, and the team leader, Gary Newton, is traveling to Haiti today.

Best,
Eric

Eric,
  I wanted you to know that Secretary Napolitano's call with Secretary Clinton will not occur today, but instead is being
scheduled for tomorrow. Secretary Napolitano wishes to discuss her meeting with IOM and our need to work together on
the issues involving the orphans in Haiti.
  Thank you. All
