Matt Irwin will send report. Suffice it to say that there was no/no discussion of sensitive topics during the proceedings,
at which Qatar chaired and the US, UK, France, Germany, KSA, Turkey, UAE, Kuwait, Morocco and .Jordan were present.
The Qatari agenda focused on the status of the Annan mission and the situation in Syria. There is no/no chair report and



                                                                                                                       1.4(D)
This meeting did not serve the purpose originating with the conversation in Seoul several months ago. I will try to    B1
compensate for some of that with a side meeting this afternoon.


                                                                                   Our Quad partners were totally with
us (we had a pre-meeting at the British residence) on the Annan mission and there was enthusiastic consensus on the
need to engage Moscow. But in terms of what I came for something got lost in translation between the Paris FOSP core
group meeting and today's meeting.                                                                                 1.4(B)
                                                                                                                       1.4(D)




More from Matt soon.
