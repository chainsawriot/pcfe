I just got off the phone with Frank L. He said Kerry didn't even know that S was planning to go. They've had this trip
planned to Afg for several months now,                                                                   he really wants to
go while he's in the region.
                JK's intent is to give publicly the similar message he gave when he went out post-Davis — the importance of
the broader strategic relationship, etc, and then in private, to tell them they needed to demonstrate they've changed
their posture on CT if he's going to be able to marshal any further support from Congress.

Here are the proposed details of the Kerry schedule                                         Frank said JK had reached out
to Donilon on this, but wasn't sure they had connected yet.
                                                                                                                            B5

          Marc is meeting with him this afternoon and will hopefully get further details.

Greta, Ro —

You asked about the preliminary program. This is the draft that Fatema Sumar shared.




Thanks, Ted

    • Sun night — JK dinner with Gen. Kayani (and Gen. Pasha if he's still around) as soon as we land. This
      would just be the Senator with Kayani and/or Pasha, no other staff.
    • Mon morning — JK breakfast with Amb. Munter and Adm. LeFever. (Also, the Senator is very
      concerned about what he's hearing on KLB so either at the breakfast or elsewhere, he may want to meet
      with Robin Raphel and/or Andy Sisson to discuss KLB).
    • Mon morning-                                                                                          1.4(D)
    • Mon lunch — One on one lunch with President Zardari                                                   B1
    • Meeting with PM Gilani — very brief but we understand the importance of meeting him while in town
                                                                                                                B5

    •     Press — Roundtable with Pakistani press and a roundtable with international press
