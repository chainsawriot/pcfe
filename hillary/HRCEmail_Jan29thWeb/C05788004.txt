Subject: Omitted thoughts in Memo

I re-read the Memo when I returned home and realized I left out a couple of thoughts. And, as the old saying goes, I'm
sorry I didn't have more time to make it shorter!

                                                                                                                             1.4(B)
                                                                                                                             1.4(D)
                                                                                                                             B1




Second: The visit of Indian Prime Minister Singh to Kabul last week was a very significant event. His speech before
Parliament should be closely tracked against Pakistani policy. They are, in fact, closely aligned and that is not an accident
on the part of India. I believe this visit affirms the possibilities of the Indian-Afghan-Pakistan track and merits our whole
hearted, immediate followup.

                                                                                   Gilani left for China the day after our
meeting




Finally                                                                                                                      1.4(B)
                                                                                                                             1.4(D)
                                                                                                                             B1



We all know this will be a troubled relationship because that is it's nature. But there are real possibilities at this moment
to put options to the test.
