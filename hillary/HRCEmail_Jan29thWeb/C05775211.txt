To the full distro with people's additions to the list.

DIANE SAWYER: Good evening. It was quite a site this evening, 700 people evacuated out of the Eiffel Tower. Anxiously
ushered down 1,000 feet to the ground. And it's the second time this has happened in two weeks. There was no bomb,
but French officials have issued a high alert for a group of terrorists said to be targeting a number of countries including,
the USA. And for its part, the U.S. has ramped up missile strikes over militant training grounds in Pakistan. We have two
reports on all of this tonight from our senior team, beginning right here with chief investigative correspondent Brian
Ross. Brian?

BRIAN ROSS: Diane, what's behind all this is what senior U.S. and European officials tell us is a credible threat of a series
of commando-style terror attacks against France, Germany, Britain, and possibly the U.S. The official said there's no

specific time or place was known, but that the plot was detected after the capture this summer of a radicalized German
Muslim who reportedly had been training with teams of others in Pakistan for the attacks. Now, a worldwide manhunt is
underway. Among those being sought now are a group of other radicalized Germans who have been training at terror
camps in Pakistan, producing videos in German to gain more recruits back home. German officials say some of the
recruits actually came from the same mosque in Hamburg where the 9/11 hijackers gathered. The mosque was closed in
early August after officials learned of the plot.

GUIDO STEINBERG: Most of these guys share a very pronounced anti-Americanism.

ROSS: Officials believe at least one team of German jihadists was dispatched to Europe over the summer, travelling on
German passports, which require no visa to enter the U.S. U.S. law enforcement officials say the captured Germans said
the new attack would be a commando-style raid, similar to what happened in Mumbai almost two years ago. And
officials say, the captured German claimed the attack had been personally blessed by Osama bin Laden. A claim that has
not yet been validated.




Here is the online story which includes the full Clapper quote: http://abcnews.go.com/print?id=11747364

"We are not going to comment on specific intelligence, as doing so threatens to undermine intelligence operations that
are critical to protecting the U.S. and our allies. As we have repeatedly said, we know AQ wants to attack Europe and
the United States. We continue to work closely with our European allies on the threat from international terrorism,
including al-Qa'ida. Information is routinely shared between the U.S. and our key partners in order to disrupt terrorist
plotting, identify and take action against potential operatives, and strengthen our defenses against potential threats."
