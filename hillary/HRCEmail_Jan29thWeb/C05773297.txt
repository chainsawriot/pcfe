Subject: ? from Amb Cousin on first lady event

Cheryl, WFP is planning a big food and nutrition food security event with First Lady Mubarak, to be hosted in Egypt (next
Feb or March). Amb Cousin is interested in proposing that it be co-hosted by Mrs. Obama and Mubarak, and wants to
know if you would have any problem with her floating this idea with J. Sheeran and then the White House.
We spoke about this possibility during the 1,000 days brainstorm â€” I think it would give us good lift (and we could find a
prominent role for Glickman as well) and provide reach into US audience.
What do you think? Thx, Cindy
