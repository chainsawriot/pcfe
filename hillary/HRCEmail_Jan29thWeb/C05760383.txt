Yes will do. Fyi, they are saying they are going to delay          announcement until after thanksgiving. They told me
yesterday that it probably would happen at end of day.

Can you see what you find on this individual — I don't know his qualifications.

Hey Justin,

I plan on being in Little Rock on Nov. 18 for the anniversary and was hoping to get a minute to visit with the President.
However, after reading all of the activities they have planned for that day it might be impossible.

Therefore, if you get a quite moment with him could you ask him something on my behalf? I would like to know if Hillary
needs anymore loyal foot soldiers at the State Department?

Thanks and hope to see you and President later this month.

Take care,
