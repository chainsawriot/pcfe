                                                                                RELEASE IN FULL




                         State/PRM Libya Humanitarian Update
                                Thursday, August 25, 2011

 Numbers at a Glance (no change)
 Libyan Refugees:
 • 90,000 in Tunisia (estimate); 60,500 registered by UNHCR
 • 9,000 in Egypt
 • 21,664 Libyan returnees; 9,289 the week of 15-21 August

 Libyan Internally Displaced Persons:
 • 75,000 (UNHCR estimate) — 50,000 in/around Tripoli/Zlitan and 25,000 in/around Misrata

 Third. Country Nationals in Libya:
 • 100,000 Egyptians (estimate by Egyptian government)
 • 1,000,000 (IOM estimate of potential evacuees if security collapses)

 Third Country Nationals in Tunisia and Egypt
 • 3,300 in Tunisia (including refugees under consideration for resettlement)
 • 1,000 in Egypt (mainly refugees under consideration for resettlement)


 Top Line Issues
   • Water scarcity in and around Tripoli has left between 2.5-4 million residents
      in need. If supplies do not become available soon, large-scale population
      movements may commence, leaving many vulnerable and putting enormous
      strain on neighboring areas and services. The shortage appears to be the
      result of a lack of fuel and the flight from Qadhafi forces of technicians who
      operate the wells that source the municipal system (about 1,000 miles to
      south of Tripoli).

    • IOM's evacuation vessel has taken on passengers from Tripoli and has
      departed for Benghazi from where the passengers will travel over land to
      Egypt for onward transport; a manifest will be available shortly. Another
      ship (with 900 pax capacity) is expected to arrive in Tripoli on Saturday and
      depart the same night for Benghazi.

    • Medical and surgical needs continue; USG has procured additional medical
      supplies for consignment to partners in Tripoli while ICRC, Libyan Red
      Crescent Society, and MSF teams are active across the country.

 Update
    •   A TNC official has been named to liaise with the UNICEF-led water task force. The
        TNC has also reached out to regional actors for assistance and to source supplies,
        including Qatar, Turkey, Tunisia, Malta, France, Italy, and Greece. UNICEF will borrow

          $10 million from OCHA Headquarters for use in responding to immediate water needs in
          and around Tripoli..

    •     Food stocks remain adequate throughout most of Libya though access is increasingly an
          issue for some. WFP has 10,000 tons of pre-positioned, un-distributed food ready to
          address any shortages in the country but again ability to distribute may be a problem.

    •     Germany will lend the TNC 100 million Euros against the frozen Libyan government
          funds in Germany. The funds are to be used for humanitarian purposes and will be
          deposited in the TFM account in Doha today.

    •     The Humanitarian Coordinator plans to move forward with the deployment of agencies
          and humanitarian actors from Zarzis, Tunisia to Tripoli, as soon as a UNDSS security
          assessment can be competed. The TNC is expected to move in part to Tripoli before Eid
          and priority actions include identifying official TNC counterparts to the international
          organizations.

    •     Cross-border access between Tunisia and Libya appears to be improving. The crossing
          point at Ras Ajdir is reportedly open, but with light activity and long waits for those
          crossing into Tunisia. The point at Dahiba remains open. On 23 August, 1,200 Libyans
          crossed to Tunisia through Dahiba border point while another 1,470 returned to Libya
          through the same entry point.

    •     Insecurity along the Zarzis-Zawiya-Tripoli road may prevent the delivery of some
          humanitarian goods from Tunisia. Additionally, four Italian journalists were kidnapped'
          yesterday (Aug 24) on the road east of Zawiya traveling toward Tripoli by an unknown
          group; no further information on their whereabouts is available at this time.

    •     An Interagency UN humanitarian assessment mission was scheduled to arrive in Misrata
          today, and plans to proceed to Zlitan on Friday /Saturday, and will return to Benghazi on
        • Sunday. The mission will be distributing mattresses, blankets, and hygiene kits.
