Subject: Turkish military sows confusion over downed jet (Reuters)

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish armed forces statements over the loss of a warplane off the Syrian coast last
month are fuelling speculation the military may be revising its initial assertion the plane was shot down by
Syrian air defences in international airspace.

  Turkish government spokesman Bulent Arinc, seeking to allay confusion over apparent contradictions
emerging in official accounts of the plane's loss along with its two pilots, reasserted the original version to
reporters on Thursday.

   "It is better not to come to different conclusions by getting hung up on certain nuances. We are talking about
an important subject. The Turkish jet was downed, the Syrian government which downed it has said 'we
downed it'," he said.

   But Turkish newspapers homed in on a military statement issued hours after Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan
himself complained on Wednesday of a "campaign inside Turkey and ... a campaign abroad" to misrepresent the
June 22 incident.

   The General Staff referred in the statement to the aircraft which "Syrian official authorities subsequently
claimed to have shot down". The use of the word 'claimed', absent from previous accounts, aroused confusion
over an incident which many Turks had initially feared could lead to a war.
