Had a long talk with him today around 7pm. I am very positive about this. We are going to meet either friday or
monday to get into more details/possible obstacles. He was concerned about how long it might take. I said it cld be
done quickly. We wld also want to do some pre-consultations with a couple of key Rs to ensure we had some, even
minimal, R support. Can talk to u more tomorrow about this.

With Rahm in the next few days, probably Friday, to talk thru confirmation issues. Feels like the next appropriate step.
Rich's # didn't work. What's the state ops #?
