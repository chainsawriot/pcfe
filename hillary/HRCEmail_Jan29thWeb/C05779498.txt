Yes -- Libya signed the CWC in February 2004. It has since been carrying out destruction of its chemical weapons stocks
under OPCW supervision, but has not completed the process. There are no longer any filled CW munitions ready for
quick use, and the remaining stocks are in poor condition. That said, folks are obviously concerned over the security of
the remaining CW stocks there.
