Bad advice he wanted to hear. Consistent with the bad advice underlying the debt limit debacle that
has led to the fiscal cliff fiasco: obsession with phantom independent voters.

Jarrett would be the one to advise ignoring base constituencies; Axelrod would go for likeability
(branding); and Plouffe would be for chasing elusive independents. Add candidate's aversion to
conflict with those outside his orbit, refusal to dispense with tattered post-partisan illusion; and
complacent assumption of personal charm. Shake and stir. Watch first debate. Blame John Kerry.

Sad, but makes some sense.

The Etch-a-Sketch Moment
At the debate in Denver, it finally happened—but Obama looked like the one
who was shaken.
    • By John Heilemann
    • Published Oct 5, 2012


But here's the crazy thing: For the first time in a long time, many Democrats are asking the same
thing about Obama—so perplexed, confounded, and just plain pissed off are they about his dismal
turn in Denver. The mystery of what happened to the president there is perhaps a bit less mysterious
than it seemed on first inspection. Five factors, I think, were at work.

First, for weeks now, the Obama campaign has been playing it safe, sitting on its lead, executing a
four-corners offense and a prevent defense; Obama's low-altitude, low-risk speech in Charlotte was
part of that game plan, which in Denver amounted to an effort to avoid unforced errors. Second,
consistent with that, Obama had been advised essentially to ignore Romney and talk directly to
voters; as his strategist David Axelrod put it the next day, "He made a choice last night to answer the
questions that were asked and to talk to the American people about what we need to move forward,
and not to get into serial fact-checking with Governor Romney, which can be an exhausting, never-
ending pursuit." Third, Obama's team is intensely focused on preserving his main electoral advantage,
which is his likability. Indeed, much of his debate prep was spent coaching him to contain his
simmering disdain for Romney; onstage, that seems to have translated into Obama's studious refusal
to make eye contact with his rival. Fourth, incumbent presidents become accustomed to being
accorded unceasing deference (and gratuitous toadying); it's been four years since anyone got up in
Obama's grill and told him he was full of shit, and the shock of it was palpable. And fifth, Obama was
prepared to debate the Romney who has been on display for the past two years, the Romney imitated
by John Kerry in debate prep—a very different Romney from the one who took the podium. Like the
rest of us, Obama was gobsmacked.
