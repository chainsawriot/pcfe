Richard,




Some final thoughts. Small stuff that would, however, yield big dividends.




A quick call from POTUS or the Secretary before President K is wheels up Sunday evening here. Next best would be a call
enroute. So much has been invested — another act of reassurance that we are committed to making this work would not
be wasted. [I assume a VTC will not happen now.]

While we are generally confident that President K will stay positive and on message while Stateside, the schedule is
demanding and there are — of course —risks. Would recommend that senior level officials with whom President Karzai
has good established relations accompany him on moves to events that will include Congressional and/or media
exposure. It is true that the last one in before the event can have a tremendous influence on moods.




Last — a brief call from POTUS to President Karzai when he is at Andrews waiting to fly back to Kabul would also be a
good gesture.




See you Monday, hopefully not covered with too much volcanic ash.




Karl
