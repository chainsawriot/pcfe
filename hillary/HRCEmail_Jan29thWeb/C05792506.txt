 Have you seen the movie Arbitrage? Not great. Must see. If you have Comcast it's on demand. The
 Richard Gere character is nothing like Romney, yet has the essence of Romney--do and say anything
 but anything to do the deal. If one business plan doesn't work, get another, then another, all fungible--
 all positions fungible.

 Sad, but makes some sense.

 The Etch-a-Sketch Moment
 At the debate in Denver, it finally happened—but Obama looked like the one
 who was shaken.
     • By John Heilemann

 But here's the crazy thing: For the first time in a long time, many Democrats are asking the same
 thing about Obama—so perplexed, confounded, and just plain pissed off are they about his dismal
 turn in Denver. The mystery of what happened to the president there is perhaps a bit less mysterious
 than it seemed on first inspection. Five factors, I think, were at work.
 First, for weeks now, the Obama campaign has been playing it safe, sitting on its lead, executing a
 four-corners offense and a prevent defense; Obama's low-altitude, low-risk speech in Charlotte was
 part of that game plan, which in Denver amounted to an effort to avoid unforced errors. Second,

consistent with that, Obama had been advised essentially to ignore Romney and talk directly to
voters; as his strategist David Axelrod put it the next day, "He made a choice last night to answer the
questions that were asked and to talk to the American people about what we need to move forward,
and not to get into serial fact-checking with Governor Romney, which can be an exhausting, never-
ending pursuit." Third, Obama's team is intensely focused on preserving his main electoral advantage,
which is his likability. Indeed, much of his debate prep was spent coaching him to contain his
simmering disdain for Romney; onstage, that seems to have translated into Obama's studious refusal
to make eye contact with his rival. Fourth, incumbent presidents become accustomed to being
accorded unceasing deference (and gratuitous toadying); it's been four years, since anyone got up in
Obama's grill and told him he was full of shit, and the shock of it was palpable. And fifth, Obama was
prepared to debate the Romney who has been on display for the past two years, the Romney imitated
by John Kerry in debate prep—a very different Romney from the one who took the podium. Like the
rest of us, .Obama was gobsmacked.
