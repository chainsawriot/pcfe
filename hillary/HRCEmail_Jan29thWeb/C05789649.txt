Sorry. Had not seen this until en route back to post. Accommodation was to have elizabeth go to a dinner meeting, but
not the next day session with senior counterpart. Bare objectives of visit were achieved but we blew an opportunity to
make the larger point about civ control of mil, which is critical in dealing with algerian leaders.

                                                                                                   1.4(D)
