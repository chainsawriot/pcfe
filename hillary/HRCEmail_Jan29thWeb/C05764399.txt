Hi all: We got a furious call from the Secretary of State of Minnesota, Mark Richie, who is very upset about a comment
made by Special envoy Holbrooke at a press conference in Paris:

Here's what he said:

"During that process there are going to be many claims of irregularities; that happens in every democracy," said
Holbrooke. "We recently had a senatorial election in Minnesota which took seven months to determine the outcome,
there were so many charges of irregularities. It certainly won't take that long in Afghanistan, but that happens in
democracies, even when they are not in the middle of a war."

As you can imagine, folks in Minnesota are pretty angry — I got an earful about the length of the recount process in MN,
which they argue wasn't about irregularities, and about how the Administration is undercutting Senator Franken with
these comments. Its making its rounds through the MN press and the blogs.
                                                              47

The Secretary of State is pretty eager to go to the press with his outrage — could use your guidance on how to respond.
