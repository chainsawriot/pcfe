Subject: Initial read-outs from Arab League meeting with Lavrov

With the conclusion of today's Arab League meetings, I spoke very briefly with Qatari PM Hamad bin Jassim (who was
boarding a flight and said he'd call me later) and at length with my usual Egyptian MFA contact who accompanied his
minister to the meeting. I also talked with Arab League SecGen Nabil ElAraby and compared notes with the Iraqi,
Omani, and Algerian FMs and the UAE deputy FM (who attended in Abdullah bin Zayed's stead, since AbZ is in Los
Angeles). Most of what follows is based on the Egyptian read-out, which was quite long. To the extent that I get
information that is different or important, I will update this note. There were two meetings: the Syria Committee's
meeting with Russian FM Lavrov, and an Arab League ministerial. (The Syria Committee wasn't just confined to the
normal six Arab members, however; ElAraby told me that 14 FMs went to the meeting with Lavrov.)

                                                                                                                             1.4(B)
                                                                                                                             1.4(D)
                                                                                                                             B1

Much of the meeting was apparently devoted to drafting the five points that were announced in the joint Arab League-
Lavrov press conference. Embassy Cairo reports that Lavrov enumerated the five points in the media conference:
               1. Stop violence from any source
               2. Establish an independent monitoring mechanism
               3. No foreign intervention
               4. Allowing humanitarian aid to reach all Syrians without any obstruction
               5. Strong support for the mission of Kofi Annan to launch a political dialogue between government and
               all political opposition according to the [mandate of the] Arab league and UNGA.




Apparently there is also an Arab League ministerial resolution issued today that includes the five points of the Lavrov-
Syria Committee press conference in the preamble. As described to me by others, the resolution is strong, with tough
language on the abuse of human rights and the need to move ahead on the January 22 resolution. The Arabs were
satisfied that this resolution, again, reaffirmed Arab unity.

I asked everyone about what happens next. Basically, everyone is waiting for Kofi Annan to report on the outcome of his
meetings today in Syria.




Three other points: First, even though the Arab League Foreign Ministers Committee shifted from Qatar to Kuwait,
ministers decided to leave HbJ as head of the Syria Committee.




So, while I need to speak to HbJ again, it seems to me that we should try again in New York.
