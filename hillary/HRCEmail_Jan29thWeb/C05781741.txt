Jake and Sheba,

As I suspected, the rumors of WFP trucks being stopped and the food on them looted by Shabaab turns out not to be
true. All a rumor. I've highlighted below what actually happened.

Just in from Nairobi, there was NO seizure of food shipments. The food, which belongs to ACF (Action contre
le faim) is still warehoused in Baidoa. They are seeking to move it, but that hasn't happened yet. Apparently
this was all a bad rumor which is not unusual at all in the Somalia context.

Subject: RE: any update on the WFP rumors?

Samantha, below is what just came in from the Somalia Unit in Nairobi. As you can see from the below, WFP in Nairobi
is stating that WFP is not/not now a partner —they are getting the story directly from the WFP Somalia Director,
Porretti. The question of whether ACF was coordinating a delivery with WFP is not/not confirmed by Post.

— In addition to what I just found about the ACF incident, I checked to Stefanno Porretti just now. He confirmed that
WFP is not yet working with ACF, He said that in the future they hope to be able to work with ACF, as well as others, in
AS areas where these entities have access. For now though, he confirmed that they are not working with ACF or any
other NGOs in AS controlled areas. WFP has not yet made any formal agreement nor have they defined what might the
tonnage nor from where food should be eventually dispatched. This are operational details they need to clarify with ACF
or others, and only when potential partners will feel confident to distribute WFP food in their areas of operations will WFP
move forward with finalizing such arrangements.

It is likely though that WFP would try to work with partners to get food commodities delivered to Bay and Bakol regions
delivered ex-Mogadisho. However, it will depend on their cooperating partners preferred option.

Thanks. so ACF is not a partner of WFP? It was transporting its own food?

From Rome via USAID last night:

The incident occurred when ACF, in coordination with WFP, undertook the first test of bringing in food aid — which could
have been leading to ACF becoming a partner of WFP. Unclear if it was WFP food.

So, overall, not WFP but still problematic. It's all I've got this morning so far.

Trying to find out a bit more, if anything, before the Senior Staff meeting with S. Any updates from last night
would be great.

Thanks!
