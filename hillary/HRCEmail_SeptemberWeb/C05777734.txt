Subject: Brian Atwood's great start & Secretary's impact here at OECD

Cheryl—Wanted you to be aware, yesterday Brian chaired his first DAC meeting and it was
universally agreed a great success. This followed last Friday's all day meeting where with US
leadership the OECD Council of Ambassadors agreed to elevate development to a major OECD
focus – a direct result of the Secretary's focus on this issue for the Ministerial. Best, Karen
