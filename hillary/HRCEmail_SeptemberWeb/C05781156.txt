Subject: Updated rudd call sheet

The dcm in australia just called to say he wants to add information to your rudd call sheet.
The DCM had a meeting with Rudd's Senior Advisor as a preview to the call. So they added three background
paragraphs that lay out what he will discuss in the call. The specials feel it is useful info for you. Ops is faxing to your
residence within the next 5 minutes.
