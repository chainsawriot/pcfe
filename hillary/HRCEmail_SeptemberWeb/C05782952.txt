Subject: India welcomes Myanmar leader for neighborly talks (AP)


NEW DELHI - (AP) Indian officials say the president of Myanmar is in Delhi for talks on strengthening ties
between the two South Asian neighbors.
  Thein Sein's visit follows his granting of an amnesty for some political prisoners in his government's latest
gesture of liberalization.
   A spokesman for India's external affairs ministry says Friday's talks with Indian Prime Minister Maninohan
Singh are focused on border security and economic development.
   India values its relationship with Myanmar because of concerns over insurgencies and drug trafficking along
their shared border. India is also competing with China for access to Myanmar's natural gas resources.
   The two countries are also expected to sign trade and investment agreements during the Myanmar leader's
four-day visit.
