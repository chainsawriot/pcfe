Subject: Pakistan says It firmly backs Tallban peace talks (AP)


KABUL (AP) - Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Gilani says his government stands strongly behind an Afghan-
led process to reconcile with the Taliban to end the war.
   At a news conference Saturday in Kabul with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, Gilani said any peace process
must be fully owned by Afghanistan and that Kabul must set the limits for any talks. Gilani says imposing
conditions or demands on prospective talks at this stage is not helpful.
   Karzai said Islamabad and Kabul have formed a commission to work out logistics for negotiations with the
Taliban.
   Both leaders said the U.S. has a role to play in the talks, but they both also criticized the U.S. and NATO
coalition.
   Gilani says U.S. drone attacks are counterproductive. Karzai lamented the deaths of Afghan civilians in
coalition operations.
