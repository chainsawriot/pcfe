Ops just called me to say that they have his staff on the line. They are attempting to get his call windows for the day, but
his staff is repeatedly suggesting only "now." If you'd like me to set up this call now or anytime soon, I'll do that.
Otherwise, ops is still trying to negotiate possibilities for later windows.
