I think the prospects of bringing to the floor in the next two weeks are quite slim - and oh by the way, we don't yet have
a committed 67 votes....

One thing we can try to do is to lock in the contours of a deal on the merits and for floor consideration with the
principals. We are going to meet this week with Durbin to discuss, as well as Reid and McConnell's Chiefs of staff. Will
also connect again with Kyl's staff. Goal would be to get Reid to tell McConnell that this is one of the first items up for
the week of nov 15th (their first week back) and to ensure we have the broad outline for a UC agreement. As you know,
getting this will depend upon Kyl. But if we can get this, then it will help protect us from election night and senate
composition uncertainties, and will allow us to lock in Republican votes over the course of October.

I'm afraid "people" not knowing includes me. Would this fact push Kerry or WH to try before election or is that lost
cause?

One fact that people may not be aware of is that immediately following the election, newly elected Senators in IL, WV,
CO and DE will serve during the lame duck session. In a worst case scenario, that could bring the Senate Dem total down
to 55, which will impact our strategy on START and appropriations, at a minimum.
