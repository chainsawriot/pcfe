Reports of 50k protestors in Tahrir Square in Cairo.

El Baradei calling for regime change and says US must choose between the government and the people. Says he's
prepared to lead a transitional government. (Though he also said he would abide by curfew.)


Curfew moved up to 4 pm, in 90 minutes.

Al apparently showing graphic images of dead protestors in the morgue.

Sketchy so far but protests seem to be growing in the three major cities after a quieter morning. Al reporting that
protesters have been fired upon in Cairo, but that's unconfirmed. Comms have been partially restored.

Trying to learn more.
