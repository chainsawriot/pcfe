Subject: Liberia opposition calls poll 'flawed,' pulls out (AP)

MONROVIA (AP) - Opposition parties in Liberia say they're pulling out of a recent presidential poll which
they called "flawed" and say they won't accept the results.
   A Saturday statement from eight opposition parties including those of the second- and third-place candidates
say the electoral commission manipulated vote-counting in favor of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.
   The statement also called for a Sunday rally but gave no details.
   Sirleaf led late Friday with 45.4 percent of the vote, falling short of the majority needed to avoid a runoff,
according to partial results.
   The Harvard-educated Sirleaf faced 15 challengers on Tuesday. She is viewed abroad as a reformer and was
awarded this year's Nobel Peace Prize for her role in stabilizing Liberia after a 14-year civil war.
