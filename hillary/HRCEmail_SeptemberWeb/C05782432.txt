Cheryl, Just heard that this year's World Food Prize winners are Kufuor (former President of Ghana) and former
President Lula. This info is embargoed until the S announcement on June 21g. S can talk about our strategic partnership
with Brazil and perhaps announce Phase II for Ghana. As we discussed, I have requested that AID hold the Phase II
announcement for S in Tanzania (June trip). We can also ask them to hold Uganda — I know you said no separate
FTF/1,000 Days event there — but it could be incorporated into another speech.
Will start on the building blocks.
Thx, Cindy
