Subject: (AP) Waters defends herself against ethics allegations

WASHINGTON (AP) â€”Veteran Rep. Maxine Waters says she violated no House rules and did no wrong in connection with
alleged ethics violations, including an assertion she sought federal assistance for a bank where her husband served on
the board. The California Democrat said "I have not violated any rules." She also told a Capitol Hill news conference that
she's gone "above and beyond" what was required by House rules in reporting her activities. Waters said she had
worked to improve access to federal regulators for the National Bankers Association, which represents 133 minority
banks, including OneUnited Bank, where her husband also owned stock. Waters contends the association requested a
meeting with Treasury officials, which was held on behalf of the organization, not OneUnited. That institution eventually
got $12 million in bailout money.
