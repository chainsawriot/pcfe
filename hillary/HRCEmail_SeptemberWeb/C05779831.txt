Subject: Lawmakers reject upbeat Afghanistan-Pakistan view (AP)


WASHINGTON (AP) - Some lawmakers are rejecting an upbeat government assessment of U.S. policy in
Pakistan and Afghanistan. They say that despite billions in aid to the countries, most people there still hate
America.
  Members of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs also voiced skepticism Tuesday about building
democracy in the tribal society of Afghanistan.
  Senior State Department official Daniel Feldman said al-Qaida was under pressure as never before at the
Afghan-Pakistan border and the Taliban's momentum has been reversed in south Afghanistan. He said
Pakistan's government is increasingly exerting control over its territory.
  Democratic Rep. Gary Ackerman said: "After hearing the same sales pitch for 10 years, I doubt it." And
Republican Rep. Steve Chabot said: "We spend all this money and they still hate us."
