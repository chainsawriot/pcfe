Hi Hillary,
Once again I am imposing on our friendship to get to you a matter that is important to my brother-in-law Bruce Ramer
and, therefore, important to me. I am enclosing his note to me just so you can read how he really talks! I know his
relationship with his friend          and can attest to the personal nature of his appeal. Thank you for whatever
attention you give to this which, by my understanding, seems to be a simple matter of justice. Alas, nothing is simple.
All the best, Brian

         Brian, I so appreciate your willingness to get my letter (attached, with attachments) into Hilary's hands.

        This is purely an act of love for my friend                  As I say in the letter to her, I am N OT acting as an
attorney (or for any organization--see end of my letter), but only for a friend who is getting screwed (not the
terminology of the letter).

       You are more than welcome to read all of the enclosures. Naturally.
       The attachments to this email should be: Ramer letter to Secretary Clinton, with an attachment of the letter
from             tax lawyer (and three official attachments thereto--a letter from the IRS to the Argentine Embassy, a
revenue ruling and a certification issued this year by the State Department.

             My letter contains a brief summary of the situation and argument.

         This is, as I said, very meaningful to me. Thank you for helping in an indispensible way.

             Love to the Greenspun clan. Bruce
