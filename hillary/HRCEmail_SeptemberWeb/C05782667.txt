PORT-AU-PRINCE (AP) - Haitian lawmakers have ended a nearly five-month stalemate by picking a prime
minister for the Caribbean nation still trying to recover from last year's earthquake.
   The 30-member Senate voted 17-3 Tuesday for Garry Conille to serve as Haiti's next head of government.
Nine abstained.
   Conille is a doctor and was an aide to Bill Clinton in the former U.S. President's role as U.N. envoy to Haiti.
   President Michel Martelly had been unable to install a prime minister since he took office in May, which has
slowed earthquake reconstruction. Two earlier picks were rejected by parliament.
   Conille will help lead rebuilding efforts as prime minister and will co-chair a recovery panel with his former
boss, Clinton.
