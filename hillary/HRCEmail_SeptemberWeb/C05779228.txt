Susan is speaking on Weds — are you saying that Susan is not coming?

If this is just a substitute question and Susan is doing her part, no substitute — can't tell from your traffic

Erica Barks-Ruggles just called to ask whether Rosemary DiCarlo can substitute for Susan, who can't be here for COM
conference because she's here today and tomorrow. I reiterated the no substitute policy but said I would check with
you.
