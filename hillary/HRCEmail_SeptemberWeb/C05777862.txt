Fyi from Jeff - I agree that this would be a good call to make.

Jake, a proposed statement on Tunisia is being sent forward now. But given what happened in Tunisia today,
we believe it is important for S to reach out to FM Morjane now and express our support. This seismic change
is going to be difficult and the US should stand up with them. We are working a memo through the system,
but it will take a while - hence my email to you now. As disgusting as we found the Ben Ali regime, it is
important that the interim government gets off to a solid start, acting quickly to restore calm and security to
the streets. It then can begin implement long overdue political and economic reforms so necessary to the
country's stability. Our support to these endeavors are critical and an early outreach to the FM — and other
gestures — will be important in setting the stage.

Suggested talking points for S
