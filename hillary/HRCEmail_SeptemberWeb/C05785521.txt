 Saudi woman defies driving ban
 A Saudi mother said on Sunday she defied a ban on women drivers in the ultra-conservative kingdom by getting behind
the wheel for four days without being stopped. Najla al-Hariri, a housewife in her mid-30s, said she drove non-stop for
four days in the streets of the city of Jeddah 'to defend her belief that Saudi women should be allowed to drive.' I don't
fear being arrested because I am setting an example that my daughter and her friends are proud of,' Ms Hariri said.
