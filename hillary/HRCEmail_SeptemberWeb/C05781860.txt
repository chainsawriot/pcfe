Subject: Turkey strikes Kurd rebels in Iraq for third night (Reuters)


ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish warplanes struck Kurdish guerrilla targets in northern Iraq in a third consecutive
night of airstrikes, military headquarters said on Saturday, adding that the planes had all returned safely to their
bases.

    It said in a statement that in coordination with the air operations, Turkish artillery had also struck 85 targets
in the region.

   The strikes follow a surge in attacks by Kurdistan Workers Party (PICK) guerrillas against the Turkish
military. Late on Friday, a Reuters witness said at least 10 war planes had taken off from an air base in
southeastern Turkey.
