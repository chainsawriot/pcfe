Subject: US ambassador to Lebanon summoned amid tension (AP)

BEIRUT (AP) - An official in Lebanon's Foreign Ministry says the U.S. ambassador has been summoned over
accusations that she is interfering with the country's political process.
   The official said January 17 the foreign minister asked Ambassador Maura Connelly to clarify the
circumstances behind her visit this weekend with lawmaker Nicolas Fattouch.
   The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak publicly. Connelly did not
take questions as she left the Foreign Ministry on January 17.
   Fattouch is seen as a key "undecided" lawmaker as Lebanon's rival political factions scramble to form a new
government.
