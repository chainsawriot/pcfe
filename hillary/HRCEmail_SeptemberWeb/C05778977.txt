   Hi Cheryl-- the name of the Brazilian Minister of Defense is Nelson                                        B1
   Jobim— he asked to meet w me privately for dinner on his last trip to
   Washington-- I conveyed to him our strong objection to Patriota's argument that we were "de-stabilizing" Brazil and
   noted that what the Foreign Ministry was objecting to was a $2 million dollar police training program.




   I later flew to Paraguay for regular consultations. In a private meeting w me President Lugo told me how much he
   appreciated US support
                                                                                                                         1.4(D)
                                                                                                                         B1
                                                                                                                         B5




   As I told you I will do whatever serves the Secretary and your interests.

    Cheers, Arturo
