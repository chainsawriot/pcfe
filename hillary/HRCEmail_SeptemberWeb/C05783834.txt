Subject: RE: Nairobi passport assistance for hosp individual

Counselor Mills,

In response to your request, Ops reached out to Embassy Nairobi which reports a consular officer visited                   at
the hospital today, obtained a privacy act waiver, and took an oath                       for a replacement passport. Post
notes the hospital is on the other side of the city and traffic is very bad, but expects to provide            with a
replacement passport by the close of business.

                              Post will continue to update Ops on the status of this case.

Regards,

Justin

Dear Burns,




                               and they have contacted their Congressman                 who is attempting to get State
Department help for the family. I don't have any idea how much clout this gentleman has — just because I've never
heard of him doesn't mean others haven't. All of that to say, do you have any pull or any suggestions how to get State
quickly involved? I don't know how responsive they are to such issues, or how many lower-level folks you have to plow
through to get to someone who can make things happen.


Blessings to you...


Kay
