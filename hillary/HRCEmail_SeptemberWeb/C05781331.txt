Dear Mme. Secretary,
As you know from your recent trip, Tanzania is in the middle of an acute power crisis that is worsening by the day as the
hydro capacity literally dries up.
Symbion is attempting to address the crisis within the limits of our ability, but have been
                                                                                                                             B4




Only by being more creative can we hope to be responsive to the crisis in Tanzania and GE can easily do its part to
support your efforts in this "Partnership for Growth" country.
Paul and I are in DC this week and always available to discuss with you or your staff either in person or by phone.
Thanks very much and warm regards. Joe
