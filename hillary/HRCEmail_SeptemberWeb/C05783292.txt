Subject: My departure

Hi Huma: I'd be very grateful if you'd pass this to the Secretary. Best, Eric

Madam Secretary:

I will leave the Department on October 8 (and begin at the Humphrey School on October 10). The transition at PRM is
on track: Anne's name has just gone to the White House, and our PDAS, Dave Robinson (whom Anne knows well) will be
Acting until Anne is confirmed. I have a wrap-up note or two that will be coming your way — focused on progress we've
made and key challenges that remain (including concrete recommendations along the lines we discussed). And I will
give a final public address at USIP next week, on our efforts on international humanitarian response.

I'm trying to get on your schedule before I leave and very much hope that will happen.

Finally, the Bureau will have a farewell reception for me on the 30th in the Department. Should your schedule permit, I'd
be honored if you could attend — though I know that demands on your schedule may make that impossible.

Kind regards,
Eric
