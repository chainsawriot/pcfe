He will get the missile defense letter.

I think Collins, Snowe and Murkowski make the most sense for today. We have a letter from you and Gates going to
Collins today on tactical nukes, so that would be a good intro to the call. Will make sure that is attached to your call
sheet.

That's good, but, we still have to produce the missile defense letter he requested. Who else should I call now that
there's a tax deal?

This is from WH leg affairs. Looks like your conversation with Voinovich made the difference.
