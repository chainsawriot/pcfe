The administration's response seems quite weak to me.




This is not like the Pentagon Papers or even the videos of the bombings, this is a wholesale capturing of the diplomatic
material of the country. No State department can operate if it can't keep its own classified cables and internal orders
confidential â€” I think this is unprecedented in history. And if this is wikileaks can get, what can the Chinese or other able
to secure?




The issues surrounding the content are significant and could have legs.




But this security breach is not a targeted breach to make a whistle blower point, it is a wholesale leak that should be
treated as putting lives in danger. For what it is worth, I think you need to order a full scale review and upgrading of the
cyber security of the state department immediately. To offer a bounty for the capture of those responsible. And as I see
you doing, take an aggressive position on Wikileaks. Just being seen as apologizing for the content is weak compared to
reacting and acting to shore up the key principles behind security and aggressively dealing with the problem directly.




For what it's worth, that's my view.
