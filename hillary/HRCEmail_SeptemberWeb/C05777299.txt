UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The UN Security Council has voted unanimously to deploy 2,000 additional
peacekeepers to Ivory Coast to bolster the 9,800-strong UN peacekeeping force until June 30. Secretary-
General Ban Ki-moon says UN peacekeepers face an "openly hostile security environment" with threats from
forces loyal to Laurent Gbagbo, who refuses to relinquish the presidency to Alassane Ouattara, internationally
recognized as the legitimate president.

The council on January 19 also extended the temporary deployment of 400 troops and 100 police officers from
March 31 until June 30. It said three infantry companies and two utility helicopters from Liberia should remain
in Ivory Coast for four more weeks, and authorized the transfer of three armed helicopters from Liberia to Ivory
Coast for four weeks.
