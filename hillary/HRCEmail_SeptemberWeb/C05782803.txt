Subject: Palestinians to push heritage agenda at UNESCO (Reuters)

RAMALLAH (Reuters) - The Palestinians will seek World Heritage status for the birthplace of Jesus once the
U.N. cultural agency admits them as a full member, and will then nominate other sites on Israeli-occupied land
for the same standing, an official said.

  Hamdan Taha, a Palestinian Authority minister who deals with antiquities and culture, said UNESCO
membership was the Palestinians' natural right. He described as "regrettable" the objections of some
governments including the United States.
