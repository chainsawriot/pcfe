Subject: Iran tests missile in display before nuclear talks (AP)

TEHRAN (AP) - Iran says it has test-fired an anti-aircraft missile near a nuclear site in a military display before
talks resume with world powers over Tehran's uranium enrichment program. The semiofficial Fars news
agency says the "Hawk" surface-to-air missile system was tested near Arak in central Iran, where a research
reactor is under construction. The January 19 report gave no other details.
