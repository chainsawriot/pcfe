RAMALLAH, West Bank, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia told the Palestinian prime minister on Monday it
would contribute $200 million to the Palestinian Authority, the official Palestinian news agency reported, funds
that will ease a crippling financial crisis faced by the PA.

  Saudi Finance Minister Ibrahim Alassaf called Prime Minister Salam Fayyad to tell him his government
would transfer the funds, the WAFA agency reported.

    A shortfall in funding from Arab states including Saudi Arabia had been identified as the main cause of the
crisis which has highlighted the PA's vulnerability as it prepares to apply for full membership of the United
Nations this week.
