Subject: Israel won't apologize for Turkish flotilla deaths (AP)

JERUSALEM - (AP) An Israeli Cabinet minister says Israel won't apologize for killing nine Turkish activists
aboard a Gaza-bound flotilla last year.
   Moshe Yaalon says he recently held three rounds of talks with the Turks, who demand such an apology to
help mend frayed ties. But he says "we are not ready to apologize."
   However, he hinted the position could change, saying "there might be some dispute" within the Cabinet.
   The activists were trying to breach Israel's naval embargo of Gaza. Israel maintains that commandos who
raided the ship opened fire because activists attacked them. The activists say they were attacked first.
   Yaalon says an upcoming U.N. report on the raid is expected to defend the naval operation and the blockade
but accuse Israel of using excessive force.
