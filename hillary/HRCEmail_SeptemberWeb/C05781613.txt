My plans were to go to fly tomorrow night and come back saturday morning. I usually get back by noon on saturday so
I'm here saturday and sunday. I'm flexible though if u need anything here tomorrow night.
Also, I'm on the way to drop off a couple of things for Mrs. Rodham. I told her that I would leave it on the bench.
