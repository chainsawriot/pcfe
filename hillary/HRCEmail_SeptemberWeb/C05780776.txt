          Dear Senator Cbartibliss and Senator Isakson:

                   I am a retired physician in. Augusta and have Jived in Georgia for over 50 years.
          Ir. addition, I am a loyal Republican and a. proud supporter of both of you in your
          successful Senate campaigns.

                  I am not one who often writes his elected representatives, but I am moved to write
          you today about Professor Goodwin Liu, a judicial nominee who awaits a confirmation
          vote in the Senate.

                  As you prepare to vote on Goodwin's nomination to the bench, I hope you will
          take this background into consideration. I understand some Senators want to block
          Goodwin's appointment because they disagree with his academic views. But I worry that
          would send the wrong message.

                  Our country has always been a. place where people who work hard and play by the
          rules can succeed at whatever they choose. Goodwin is a success story, and his
          qualifications are outstanding. I can't think of many people of his background who have
          made it as far as he has in the legal profession. I am proud of him and his family, and I
          believe most Americans would be proud if ho became a judge. I hope you Will support
          his confirmation. At a minimum, I hope you will help end debate on Goodwin's
          nomination so he can get the vote he deserves. Those of us in Georgia who helped the
          Lius get started in this country will be watching.

                                                      Sincerely,



                                                      Arthur L. Humphries, M.D.

                 Pnofessor Goodwin Liu
