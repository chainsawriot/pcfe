The Canadian morning assessment. More general than your sit reps as the audience can be wide in Ottawa and they
look for more general trends. For what it's worth.

WMGR006i: HAITI - Despite organizational problems, a calmer second round bodes well for the
completion of the electoral process


Summary
Four full months after the troubled first round of elections, Haitians headed back to the polls this
morning to elect a new President and a new Parliament. These are historic and important elections
for Haiti's future stability and development. For the first time in the country's 207 year history, power
may be passed from one democratically-elected president to another. For the first time in the
country's history, we have a second round to determine who will be the next head of state. And for the
first time in the country's history, someone from the opposition is slated to wrest power from the
ruling party. Although the process has been chaotic and opaque, these are no small feats in Haiti's
young democracy. Should we see a successful conclusion to this long, drawn-out process, either a 70-
year-old professor and former first lady or a colourful kompa musician will become the country's next
head of state. The choice couldn't be more stark. Given the latest polls and campaign momentum, it
is expected that Michel Martelly will defeat Myrlande Manigat. The sudden return of Jean-Bertrand
Aristide and rumours he is backing Manigat, however, could give her a badly-needed boost at the
ballot box. It is also expected that these elections will dramatically change the face of the Haitian
Parliament, with the ruling party INITE losing their grip on the lower house and being forced to
negotiate with up-and-coming opposition bloc, ALTENATIV. The major challenges reported from the
field thus far, as expected, include delays with the opening of voting centres, the late delivery of voting
materials, inaccurate electoral lists and poorly trained elections officials. The situation remained
relatively calm throughout the morning with only sporadic incidents of violence, unrest and voter
intimidation reported.

PRNCE has deployed 10 elections observation teams in seven of the country's 10 departments (as was
done for the first round) to follow the day's events. This report includes information from those
Canadian observers as well as American and OAS teams, and UN sources. A second report will be
distributed this afternoon and an update on the tabulation process, sent later this evening.

Report
Organisations problems bedevil the elections process once again
3. Despite enhanced measures taken by the Haitian electoral council (CEP) in recent weeks,
organisational challenges continue to be an important factor in the second round. The most serious
problem has been the late delivery of sensitive elections materials to voting centres in the Ouest
department where 40% of the 4.7 million eligible voters reside. 97 voting centres did not
receive ballots or, in the case of 40 centres, received ballots for the wrong candidates. MINUSTAH is
trying to remedy the problem but the lack of voting materials caused significant delays with the
opening of these centres and for tensions to rise in certain parts of Port-au-Prince where Martelly has
a strong following. If people begin to believe this is part of wider attempt to disenfranchise their
supporters, the situation could become difficult to manage in certain parts of the city. Canadian
observation teams are reporting that while most of their voting centres opened late, people are able to
vote freely without much incident. The most common problems are disorganization within the
centres, people coming to the wrong location to vote, having difficulty finding their names on the
electoral list, sloppy application of procedures with respect to inking voters' fingers, and a lack of
privacy while voting in cramped areas. These were, however, all problems which were expected to
occur and should hopefully not affect the overall credibility of the process.

Voter participation and incidents of fraud
4. Most of the Canadian observation teams are reporting higher voter interest and participation rates
than the first round. Voters are predominantly men with women voters expected to participate in
larger numbers this afternoon following church. With voter participation estimated at approximately

22% in the first round, anything between 25-30% would be considered a success for the second. To
date, few incidents of obvious fraud have been reported with the exception of a case in Jeremie where
ballot boxes appeared half-stuffed by 9:30 a.m. The incident has been reported to MINUSTAH
elections officials in Port-au-Prince. All of Haiti's principal political actors resort to fraud to win
elections and it is not expected that these elections will be any different. Higher than usual levels of
fraud are expected at the legislative level as INITE attempts to maintain its control over Parliament in
the face of stiff competition from opposition parties and without a presidential candidate on the
ticket. PRNCE will continue to monitor alleged cases of fraud closely and report them to the proper
authorities.

Security situation in the country
5. Thankfully, the security situation in the country has remained relatively calm to date. With the
exception of isolated incidents of violence and voter intimidation here and there across the country,
there are no major incidents to report. Tensions are mounting in certain areas of the Ouest
department, including Cite Soleil and Pacot in Port-au-Prince, where ballots have yet to be delivered
and people have been waiting in the sun more than five hours to vote. If the situation is not remedied,
these tensions risk becoming more problematic. Yesterday evening, rumours circulated that trucks
laden with firearms had been distributed in Cap Haitien and other urban centres with the intent to
disrupt the vote and that a major incident was planned for this afternoon, but there is no confirmation
that this is true or will take place. Canadian observation teams are reporting for the most part that
the atmosphere at voting centres is calmer than the first round, with fewer problems with political
party observers and fewer acts of voter intimidation.

The Aristide Effect
6. The dramatic return of former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide on Friday has not/not had a major
impact on these elections. His references to Fanmi Lavalas having been unfairly excluded from the
process have not led to a boycott although concern remains regarding the impact this, and the
population's concern for their personal safety while voting, may have on voter turnout. Unless
Aristide makes a public pronouncement soon, something PRNCE does not expect, his ability to
influence the day's events should be limited. Having probably, and accurately from post's view,
calculated that his capacity to derail the process was limited, how he will react next week, or following
the expected publication of preliminary results on 31 March, will be more important and will be
monitored closely. Despite international media reports regarding Aristide being greeted by throngs of
jubilant supporters's return, it should be noted that crowds were much smaller than
anticipated/feared. This may, in part, be attributable to the early arrival of his aircraft and the fact
that many of his supporters were surprised he returned, but it may also reflect a shift in Haitian
politics and that Aristide's influence has waned during his seven years in exile and will take time to
rebuild.

Post Comments
7. Despite inconsistencies and organizational problems at voting centres, some serious, the second round of
Haitian general elections is proceeding significantly more smoothly than the first. Voter interest and
participation seems higher. The security situation is calmer with fewer incidents of violence, voter intimidation
and voter frustration. In general, the good news seems to be that Haitian citizens are able to exercise their
right to vote much more freely than the November debacle. PRNCE will continue to monitor the situation
closely and will provide an update at 4:00 p.m. A final report will follow this evening following a Core Group
meeting called by the SRSG and once Canadian teams provide feedback on the tabulation process (polls close at
4:00 p.m.).
