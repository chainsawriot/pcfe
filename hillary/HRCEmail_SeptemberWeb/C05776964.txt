Happy New year Hillary
So sorry you did not meet up with tony yesterday but I know you are on a whirlwind.
Whilst you're in Doha do you have any time to meet with the Chairman of the Qatar Food Security Programme. I have
mentioned their work to you before. They are looking to invest $10million into food security over the next few
years. He is called Fahed Al Atiyah and his contact number is                if your office can squeeze him in.

Cherie Blair
