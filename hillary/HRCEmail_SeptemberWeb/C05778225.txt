Got full text and it looks very good compared to what we had any right to expect. We, impromptu, helped propel a
standing ovation for Espinosa in the plenary a few minutes ago to make it hard for the bads boys to block later on.
Plenary then adjourned, everyone studying more closely and meeting among their groups. Has to still go through some
formal processes tonight and back to full plenary for adoption, probably middle of night or early morning. Still a chance
that bad guys will try to torpedo, but the show of overwhelming support from floor makes that a lot harder. Will keep
you posted.
