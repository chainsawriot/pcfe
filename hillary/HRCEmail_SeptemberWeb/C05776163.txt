CARACAS (AP) - It was a rare display of diplomacy between representatives of two countries on less than
diplomatic terms with each other. President Hugo Chavez and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton
shook hands and chatted briefly Saturday. The handshake came in Brazil as leaders were milling about at the
inauguration of the new president, Dilma Rousseff. It was unclear what Chavez and Clinton discussed. Chavez
later described the interaction as a pleasant one, though he did not give much detail.
