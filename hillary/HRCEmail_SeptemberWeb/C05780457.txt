Thanks. Give Her my very best--good piece in the New Yorker. She's the Cabinet superstar, hands down. I
miss seeing you all but appreciate the outstanding work being done and know it comes at great personal cost.
Thank you for all you do.

Thanks. Is HRC coming to Colorado Springs next week for the AFA commencement and, if so, any
chance Driver and I might get to spend a few minutes with her?
