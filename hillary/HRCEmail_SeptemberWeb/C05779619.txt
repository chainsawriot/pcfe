Subject: Afghan leader calls on US Congress to condemn Koran burning (Reuters)

KABUL, April 3 (Reuters) - Afghan President Hamid Karzai called on Sunday for the U.S. Congress to
condemn the burning of a Koran by a radical fundamentalist U.S. pastor and prevent it from happening again,
his office said in a statement.

  Karzai made the request at a meeting with U.S. ambassador Karl Eikenberry and General David Petraeus, the
commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, the statement said.

   Eikenberry read to Karzai from U.S. President Barack Obama's earlier condemnation of the Koran burning,
the statement said, but did not include any response from the Afghan leader.
