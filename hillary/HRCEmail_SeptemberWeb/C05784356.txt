Subject: EU powers to draft UN sanctions resolution on Syria (Reuters)

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Britain, France, Portugal and Germany said Thursday they would begin
drafting a U.N. Security Council sanctions resolution on Syria.

   "We believe that the time has come for the council to take further action," Britain's Deputy U.N.
Ambassador Philip Parham told reporters after a closed-door council meeting on Syria. The German, French
and Portuguese envoys echoed his remarks.

   U.S. Deputy Ambassador Rosemary DiCarlo said that Washington also supported "further measures" against
Syria by the 15-nation Security Council.
