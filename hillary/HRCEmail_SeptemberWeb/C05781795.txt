Subject: Myanmar's Suu Kyi meets president -govt source (Reuters)

YANGON, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Myarunar's Aung San Suu Kyi met President Thein Sein on Friday, a
government source said, the first meeting between the two and the latest olive branch from the army-backed
regime that came to power this year after five decades of direct military rule.

   Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize winner who spent 15 years in detention under the former military rulers for
campaigning for democracy, flew to the capital, Naypyitaw, to meet Thein Sein, formerly a top general in the
military regime.

  They met at the presidential palace, a senior official from the Ministry of Information said, declining to be
named. The official had no details on what was discussed but said it was only a short meeting.

   It was the first visit by Suu Kyi to Naypyitaw, a city built five years ago on a mountain plateau about 205
miles (330 km) north of Myanmar's old capital and biggest city, Yangon.
