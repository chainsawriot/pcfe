As I'm sure you've heard by now, Shimon Peres' wife Sonia passed away last night in her sleep. Although they were
estranged, it has nevertheless come as a blow to Shimon. I'm sure he would greatly appreciate a call from the Secretary,
if it hasn't happened already. And the Israeli people will appreciate it too.

Martin.
