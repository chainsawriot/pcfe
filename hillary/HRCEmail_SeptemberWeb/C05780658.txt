Subject: Syrian FM warns ambassadors not to leave capital (AP)

BEIRUT (AP) - Syria's foreign minister has warned the U.S. and French ambassadors not to travel outside
Damascus without permission.
   Walid al-Moallem said Wednesday that if the ambassadors defy the orders, Syria will ban all diplomats from
leaving the capital.
   Earlier this month, the U.S. and French ambassadors traveled to the restive city of Hama, a stronghold of
opposition to President Bashar Assad.
   The Syrian government slammed the visit and said it was unauthorized. The regime accused the envoys of
interfering in Syria's internal affairs.
   Syria is trying to quell a four-month-old uprising challenging President Bashar Assad's rule.
