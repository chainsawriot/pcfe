TEHRAN (Reuters) - Turkish President Abdullah Gul used a news conference with his Iranian counterpart on
Monday to call on Middle Eastern governments to listen to the demands of their people.

   Gul's first official visit to Tehran coincided with a planned opposition demonstration, in support of popular
uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia, which organisers hoped would revive Iran's reformist "Green" movement.

   President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's government, which considers the Green movement "seditionist" after
protests against his 2009 re-election, has not authorised the rally.

  At a joint news conference, both presidents spoke of their countries' close relations, but Gul went on to
comment on the rise of popular discontent in the Middle East.

   "My view is that what is happening should in no way be regarded as a surprise. In this age of
communication, in an age where everybody is aware of each other, the demands and desires of the people are
very realistic," Gul said, in response to a question about the state of Middle East affairs.
