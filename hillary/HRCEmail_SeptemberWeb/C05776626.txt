Jake and Huma,

An indictment has been handed down. It will now undergo a review that could last six weeks. NEA believes that we
should hold off on calls as long as no specific information is made available or leaks.

See announcement below:

Special Tribunal for Lebanon, Herman von Hebei, can confirm that the Prosecutor of the tribunal has submitted an
indictment and supporting materials to the Pre-Trial Judge. The documents, which relate to the assassination of Rafiq
Hariri and others, were handed to the Registry at 16:35PM (local time) on Monday 17th January 2011. They will now be
reviewed by the Pre-Trial Judge, Daniel Fransen. The contents of the indictment remain confidential at this stage.
