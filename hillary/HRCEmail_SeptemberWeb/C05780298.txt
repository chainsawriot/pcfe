Subject: UN rights chief urges probe into Iraq camp deaths (AP)


GENEVA (AP), The U.N.'s human rights chief has called for an independent probe into the deaths of 34
people during last week's Iraqi military raid on a camp housing Iranian exiles.
  U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said in a statement Friday there is "no possible
excuse for this number of casualties" from the April 8 operation that drew sharp rebukes from Baghdad's
Western allies.
  She has called for a "full, independent and transparent inquiry," and for any person found responsible for the
use of excessive force to be prosecuted.
  Pillay said other countries should consider taking in members of the People's Mujahedeen Organization of
Iran who live in the camp and have fallen out of favor in Iraq since the fall of Saddam Hussein.
