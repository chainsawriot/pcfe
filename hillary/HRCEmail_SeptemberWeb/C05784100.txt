Subject: Yemeni army shelling kills more than 20 militants (AP)



SANAA (AP) - Residents of a town in southern Yemen overrun by radical Islamists say government shelling
has killed more than 20 militants in the past two days.
  Walid al-Hawshadi said Tuesday he saw a militants driving the bodies out of Jaar for burial. Other residents
gave similar accounts.
  More than five months of mass protests seeking to oust longtime President Ali Abdullah Saleh have shaken
security across Yemen. Radical groups linked to al-Qaida have overrun at least two towns in the country's south
and government forces have been trying to force them out.
  The U.S. fears al-Qaida and other radical groups could exploit chaos in Yemen to step up operations.
