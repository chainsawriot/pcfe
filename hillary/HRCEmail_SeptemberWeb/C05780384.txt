Cheryl,

We had a good meeting last week with Jean-Louis, Marriott executives, OPIC, etc regarding building hotels in Haiti — I am
pursuing this vigorously and hope to be able to develop 2 to 3 hotels with Marriott as manager. I am talking with
Commerce and Export/Import Bank today.

R          t the White House I had a brief discussion with Secretary Clinton
           I do not have a proper email for her. Would you forward the following to her for me?

I will keep you informed about our progress in Haiti — we are going to need all the help we can get.

Thanks,
Dick


Dear Madame Secretary,

Dick
