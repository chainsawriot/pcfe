Subject: Pakistani politican tells army: Stop meddling (AP)

ISLAMABAD (AP) - Pakistan's opposition leader says the country's arniy should stop interfering in domestic
and foreign affairs of the civilian government, in a rare criticism of the powerful military.
   The remarks June 10 by Nawaz Sharif appear aimed at capitalizing on popular anger at the army in the wake
of the U.S. raid on Osama bin Laden last month.
   Sharif told reporters that the army should stop its "dominance of Pakistan's foreign policy" and stop favoring
"one particular party" in Afghanistan.
   His comments could open up a new and unpredictable faultline between one of the country's most popular
politicians and the powerful military.
   National elections are scheduled for 2013, and many analysts believe Sharifs party is likely to win.
