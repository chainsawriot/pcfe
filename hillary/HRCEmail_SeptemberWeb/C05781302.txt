                                                               It was so nice to visit with you and HRC when I
was in DC.




We have big news today that I wanted to be sure to share with you and HRC before it hits the press. Governor
Brown is announcing this morning that he is appointing Goodwin to the California Supreme Court. It feels like
the right thing for Goodwin and for all of us - I've come to really like California in the end :) Thanks again for
all you did to support Goodwin. I'm positive that this opportunity would have never presented itself had the 9th
Circuit nomination not happened - so once again you are helping to set our life path :) Please send our biggest
thanks to HRC, too.

xxoo,
Ann
