Subject: Hollande claims win in French presidential primary (AP)

PARIS (AP) - Francois Hollande has declared victory in the French Socialist Party presidential primary.
  Hollande said as results rolled in Sunday night, "I note with pride and responsibility the vote tonight that with
more than 55 percent of the vote gives me the large majority I had sought."
  He urged the French left to unite behind his bid for the presidency in elections next April and May. Hollande
would be the chief challenger to conservative President Nicolas Sarkozy, who is widely expected to run.
  Hollande says the victory gives him the "strength and the legitimacy" for the expected showdown.
