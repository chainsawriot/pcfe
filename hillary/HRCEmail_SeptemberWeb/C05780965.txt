Forget the conf call since Crocker has been confirmed. So just schedule my call to Eikenberry.

Just e-mailed a revised grid to Oscar and CC'd Huma. To flag for you, I believe Elizabeth Littlefield and Sen. Scott Brown
just returned your calls through Ops. As noted on your fresh grid, they are both reachable in the 5:00 - 5:30 PM time
frame this evening, which is coming up soon.
For your Eikenberry call, I want to flag for you that I have added him to your grid individually, but wish to remind you
that Lona is still working to schedule a conference call among you, Eikenberry, and Lindsey Graham. (That is reflected,
too).
