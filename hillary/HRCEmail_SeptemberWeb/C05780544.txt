Subject:                           Visit to Tunisia



Dear Gordon:

I'm very much looking forward to my trip to Tunis this week and I thought it might be helpful if I wrote ahead to give you
a better sense of my hopes and objectives for the visit. As you know, we have all been asked by the Secretary to
reevaluate and assess our programs and initiatives throughout North Africa and the Middle East to ensure that we are
well-positioned to respond to the rapidly evolving political and social landscape. I have discussed this matter with the
Secretary, Bill Burns and Jeff Feltman and we all agree that Tunisia provides us with some unique opportunities to pilot
new approaches in our outreach to a broad cross section of civil society organizations and representatives and cast our
relationship with them as a two-way conversation.

With this in mind we have designed a slightly unorthodox format for the trip, centered around a full-day workshop with
a diverse group pulled from Tunisian civil society. The workshop would be an open, brainstorming opportunity for
Tunisians to collaborate with us on evaluating whether our public diplomacy and MEPI programs really meet their
current needs, explaining to us what would be useful, and brainstorming about potential new approaches or programs
to ensure that US engagement is providing something of value to Tunisians. While there is a broad range of important
Embassy programs that engage civil society (e.g. USAID, etc.), for the purpose of this meeting we propose to keep our
focus only on public diplomacy and MEPI programs.

I would like this workshop to be an occasion to examine our outreach in an open and collaborative way. We have had
success with this format in Washington for brainstorming new programs and ways of doing business for PD globally. We
recognize that this is a new approach and that we will need to improvise during the day to ensure fruitful discussion.
However, I am confident that this experiment is worthwhile. I am pasting a rough schedule for the day below to give you
some sense of the flow I am imagining.

This workshop day would be complemented by other meetings and events, where I could get broader perspective on
Tunisia and help to focus on any issues that might be useful to advancing your objectives in country.

I would be happy to discuss this with you further, and I'm looking forward to an interesting and productive visit.

Best regards,




Judith McHale
