Subject: The Chamber of Deputies Approves Prime Minister Conille's Action Plan

Deputies voted 81 for, 0 against, and seven abstained, approving Gary Conille's action plan, capping a four-step
approval process.

During a marathon session that lasted about 17 hours, each Deputy addressed particular aspects of Conille's action plan.
Prospective Ministers of Foreign Affairs Laurent Lamothe and of the Interior and National Defense Thierry Mayard-Paul,
respectively, did not attend, as they accompanied President Martelly to the Dominican Republic.
