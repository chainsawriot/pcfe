Subject: Mubarak still in hospital, health 'unstable' (Reuters)

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt's former President Hosni Mubarak is still in hospital in the Red Sea resort of Sharm
el-Sheikh and his health is "unstable", a medical source said on Wednesday.
    "Former President Hosni Mubarak remains in hospital here and his health is unstable," the source told
Reuters from Sharm.
    Mubarak was ordered detained for 15 days earlier on Wednesday as investigators probe the killing of
protesters, embezzlement of public funds and abuse of power. He has denied any wrongdoing.
