You're very welcome. We've got a pretty good process in place handling the projects, and as always, we have a great
product to sell.

And as a non-Methodist list maker, this project now comes off mine, and Caroline will be crossing it off our white board
tomorrow, a very satisfying ritual. Esquire's should hit soon and will hopefully be as positive. Then it's just 60 left, and I
feel good about that too.



I would say that the one thing that's going to continue to be annoying is people pressing you on how long you'll serve.
When Tavis got you to say you probably won't for 8 years, that was especially stupid newsmaking on his part. Hirsh tried
it with four, and I think others will.

Might just be easiest to say, I've learned not to predict the future - including my own - but I intend to and hope to. We
have a lot to do, so much that we've started, and I want to see it through.

Or just a simple I hope to

If you don't you don't nobody's going to call you on saying you 'intended to' a year earlier. Again, the 8 years was
especially dumb speculation

But these questions are really code for are you happy, are you being treated well, do you have enough juice? And no
point to let people interpret the answer to their nefarious use.

Thx for all your help especially since I know it's hard helping Methodists!

Really good stuff. Especially fantastic opening page

Getting very very good feedback

I can't even remember now what if anything in it bugged me yesterday. Nothing in it has anyone making a double take
to flesh out so far.

Its overall frame of the partnership paints you in exactly the way I think people respect you most, and I think Hirsh might
actually have come up with a theme that will stick.

Have only seen the cover photo online, I want to see the hardcopy since we all know it's the pictures that really matter.
Text on the cover is great
