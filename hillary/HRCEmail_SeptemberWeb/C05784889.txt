Subject: Spanish trip to Tripoli

Jake,

We're hearing that former Spanish president Gonzalez traveled to Tripoli today, apparently at Sarkozy's request, to talk
to Q. We have no visibility into this; in the end, our ambassador in Madrid did not go in to see the Spanish on this (given
understanding this was really a French initiative).

Just so you're aware, given S-Juppe etc.

We are trying to track from here but not sure we'll see any further readout.
