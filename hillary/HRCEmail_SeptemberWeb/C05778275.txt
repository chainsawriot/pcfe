I know you are busy but I wanted to close the loop with you on the ED position (Lois Quam), the chair position for
Operations Committee, and the need to ensure that there is specific language in the QDDR that keeps PEPFAR in the
State Department (one or two sentences). I believe it is in all our interests to do this. [AGREE] I also wanted to discuss
with you the process to determine the benchmarks. [I WISH WE COULD GET THEM IN QDDR SO THERE IS FIRMNESS
AND CLARITY — WORRIED IF WE DO IT LATER IT WILL BE A NEGOTIATION AND SQUISHY]; Raj is hesitant to concretize,
plus I know he is very busy. We are going to deliver to him today a version that has been agreed on by CDC and OGAC. I
will propose a process that would include a public vetting of the benchmarks but do not think the benchmarks need to
be specifically defined in the QDDR. [FINE BUT SEE ABOVE — CAN I SEE DRAFT AS IS?] The reference to the Operations
Committee and the Secretary as the trigger for movement into USAID is enough.




I have been made aware of a growing discussion on the Hill around GNI as an attempt by the Administration to diminish
the PEPFAR program contributions because of its association with President Bush. Last night's prime time FOX news
piece (>10 minutes) on PEPFAR was well done. President Bush was clear about why he started PEPFAR and why he feels
it is still the right thing to do and to continue (Humanitarian/Security both addressed). He also spoke directly to the
bipartisan nature of the program (from inception) and the need to continue bipartisan support. It was a missed
opportunity not to have had President Obama on the FOX piece to make the point that "GNI is building on PEPFAR..."
and to begin a bipartisan dialogue. (WH declined as I understand it) [WE SHOULD MAKE THIS POINT — S ALWAYS CREDITS
BUSH ON THIS B/C HE EARNED IT — WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE IT'S PART OF OUR NARRATIVE — I BELIEVE IT CAN BE
DROPPED IN QDDR DRAFT TO THAT EFFECT— CAN YOU WORK WITH DANA TO MAKE SURE THAT LANGUAGE GETS IN BY
SUNDAY?]




Global Fund

I am here through Saturday, then off to Bulgaria to lay in the reform efforts at the Global Fund retreat followed by the
GF Board meeting in Geneva (I won't stay for the whole meeting, just the first day). John Monahan and I have been
aggressive in insisting on Board Chair (BC)and Vice Chair (VC) coordination of the reform effort. This has been reflected
in a letter from BC and VC with ED support that the retreat directly address and coordinate the reform effort, establish a
level for round 10 and address the Maternal and Child Health GF expansion (GWI supports). I feel we will establish
targets and timelines in this meeting with a reporting structure directly to the Board. In addition, there will be
politicking on the election of a new Board Chair (Tedros' term ends in April). It is critical the new chair be fully aligned
with the reform efforts. [GOT IT — FLAGGING FOR S TOO]
