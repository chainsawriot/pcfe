Does "tomorrow" mean Sunday or Monday?

Yes -- around 5 tomorrow evening. We're working on prebrief time. Derek was huge in this process, but Bob deserves a
lot of credit too. We'll have the three of them - Derek, Jim, and Bob - at the prebrief.

I agree with you ... The document is really strong.

Am I going to mtg            to discuss draft?                                                                         B5

Derek's draft is very good. I have a few questions I'd like to raise w him and Jim on Monday.
