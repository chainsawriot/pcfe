Subject: Somali Interior Minister Killed in Suicide Attack (SBU)

(SBU) Embassy Nairobi confirms Somali Interior Minister Abdishakur Sheikh Hassan was hit by shrapnel
during a bomb attack in his home and immediately taken to a Mogadishu hospital, where he died from his
injuries. As a self-declared member of Ahlu Sunnah Wal Jamaa, a moderate Islamic group opposed to al-
Shabaab, Sheikh Hassan was likely targeted by al-Shabaab. No group has claimed responsibility for the
killing.
