Please see the note below. We've been informed by Senator Menendez's office that he no longer wants to

Subject: RE: Menendez

I just got a call from Jodi. Menendez no longer wants to speak to the Secretary. He doesn't want to speak to Donilon
either. We can expect to receive a letter from Senator Menendez reflecting his displeasure with his lack of consultation
and the announcement.
