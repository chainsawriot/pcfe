 Subject: RE: No statement out of Cairo meeting

 I talked to Lynn Pascoe. As expected

                            Pascoe recommended that, if asked by the media, we simply point to the statements made by
 UNSYG Ban, Amre Moussa, and Catherine Ashton afterwards, which used the points we needed in terms of Q having lost
 his legitimacy, transition starting, etc.

 Subject: RE: No statement out of Cairo meeting

 No statement is better than a bad statement, but we could still have articles about divisions in the international community
 as demonstrated by the lack of statement. So thanks for the warning. Ron, better get the Libya crowd and media crowd
 to work on media guidance.

 Subject: No statement out of Cairo meeting

  Lynn Pascoe just phoned to say that the Cairo meeting did not produce a statement. He knew that P was concerned by
  the possibility that any statement coming out of Cairo would be weaker than what we got in Doha yesterday. - rw
