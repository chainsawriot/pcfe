Subject: Clinton says looking to raise pressure on Syria (Reuters)

NUUK (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Thursday that Washington and its allies were
seeking ways to increase pressure on Syria to make reforms.

   Clinton, in Greenland for talks with foreign ministers, said Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was
increasingly isolated.

   "We are going to hold the Syrian government accountable," she said after meeting the Danish foreign
minister. "The United States along with Denmark and other colleagues are going to look for ways to increase
the pressure."
