 Obama's record-smashing $86M haul
 By: Glenn Thrush
 July 13, 2011 06:15 AM EDT
 President Barack Obama has shattered first quarter fundraising records for a White House
 incumbent by raising $86 million for the first quarter — dwarfing the 2012 GOP field's total
 take and breezing past his own target of $60 million.

 The shock-and-awe showing was announced by Obama 2012 Campaign Manager Jim
 Messina, wearing his signature blue dress shirt sans tie, in a web video blasted to
 supporters in the pre-dawn hours on Wednesday, two days before the 15,000-page
 combined Obama for America and Democratic National Committee report is due to go up
 on a government web site.

 Earlier this month, Democratic fundraising sources close to the campaign told POLITICO
 that Obama would easily achieve his goal of besting former President George W. Bush's
 combined take of $50.1 million at the same point in the 2004 election cycle.

 The total amount Obama raised in the first three months of 2011 also amounted to more
 than twice the $35 million raised collectively by the announced field of Republican
 presidential candidates.
 "It's a monumental achievement," Messina said.

•Messina touted the campaign's commitment to grassroots organizing, and the fact that the
 average donation was $69 — lower even than the 2008 average contribution. Obama's
 campaign organization had come under fire from some on the left who accused them of
 focusing too heavily on Democratic money players.

 The former deputy White House Chief of Staff, who spent much of the spring barnstorming
 around the country to stoke enthusiasm among big-dollar donors, didn't immediately
 provide details on how much cash was raised from contributions above $250. Those will
 be itemized on the Obama Victory Fund report due to be posted by the Federal Election
 Commission on Friday.

So far, 552,462 people have contributed to the joint committee, a figure Messina
described as "more grassroots support at this point in the process than any campaign in
political history."

Officials with Obama's Chicago-based campaign have downplayed reports that they plan
to raise $1 billion by Nov. 2012, but they have said they hope to match or exceed the
approximately $750 million he raised in 2008 — a small-donor fueled, internet-based effort
that rewrote the presidential campaign playbook.

Despite the massive haul, Messina still sought to cast the president as a financial
underdog, emphasizing Obama's refusal to take PAC or lobbyist cash — and hitting the
GOP on its aggressive third-party fundraising effort in the wake of the Citizens United
case.

"It's going to get tougher from here... GOP outside spending for 2012 will be as much as
$500 million... This is a whole new ballgame like we've never faced before," he added.
