MANAMA (Reuters) - Saudi military vehicles entered Bahrain on Monday, crossing via a causeway that joins
the world's top oil exporter to the tiny island kingdom, two witnesses said.

   Hundreds of Bahraini protesters gathered behind makeshift checkpoints around Pearl roundabout to confront
any crackdown. It was not clear where the Saudi vehicles were heading, but the causeway is less than half an
hour by car from Pearl roundabout.

   The witnesses said more than 100 military vehicles crossed the bridge. Earlier in the day, police blocked off
the bridge leading from the airport to Bahrain's financial district near Pearl roundabout. Protesters blocked the
same road to cut off the roundabout, focal point of weeks of protests.
