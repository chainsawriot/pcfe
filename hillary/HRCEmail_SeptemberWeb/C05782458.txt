Subject: RE: UNOCI

Jake, I hope this helps. I consulted with USUN and AF to fact check this:

The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has given the UN Mission in Cote d'Ivoire (UNOCI) a very clear chapter 7
mandate. UNSC Resolution 1933 (June 2010) is the most recent confirmation of this. UNOCI's mandate includes the
responsibility to "protect civilians...within its capabilities and...in high risk areas of deployment," monitor the arms
embargo, facilitate the flow of humanitarian assistance, and other responsibilities. Last week, the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS), in which Nigeria is a driving force, released a communiqu√© that called on the UNSC to
strengthen UNOCI's mandate. However, our view and the view of the UK and France is that the UNSC has already given
UNOCI the strongest mandate possible. It's UNOCI's rules of engagement (ROE), which are drafted by the UN
Department of Peacekeeping Operates (DPKO), and not the Mission's UNSC mandate that should be strengthened and
clarified. We're working in New York to push the DPKO to clarify UNOCI's ROE.

AF and USUN's view is that UNOCI should do a better job in carrying out the civilian protection component of its
mandate. USUN is working with the French to make this clear in the current UNSC resolution that is being negotiated in
New York today, including inserting language that "stresses [the UNSC's] full support given to UNOCI to use all necessary
means to carry out its mandate to protect civilians." Nigeria, as a non-permanent member of the UNSC, is an active part
of these discussions. To help enable UNOCI, we are working with other donors to train and equip new troop
contributors to bring UNOCI's force level from its current deployment of approximately 9,000 soldiers to the mandated
level of 11,150.

Matt
