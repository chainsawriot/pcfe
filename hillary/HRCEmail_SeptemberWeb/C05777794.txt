Colleagues,
We just completed two conference calls on Egypt. One with Amb. Scobey, the other a much larger operational call. A
few highlights:
    • Amb. Scobey characterized the "streets are out of control" and that police have lost control of the
        situation. Some press is reporting that police are shedding uniforms.
    • There are protestors are in front of the Embassy. Embassy is calling for back police support and has asked the
        Egyptian to reiterate to the government that we need additional protection around the Embassy

      •    APP Alexandria director and local staff were evacuate out of Alexandria (there is only one direct hire American in
           the APP)
      •    6 pm to 7 am curfew for in place for Cairo, Alexandria, and Suez. Police say anyone out will be shot. So far
           today police have not used lethal force
      •    Protest occurring Y2 dozen areas around Cairo with 1000-5000 demos.
      •    Police are using tear gas, rubber bullets, but falling back under crowds.
      •    Demos using Molotov cocktails, police stations and vehicles being burned down. Roads to the center of town
           largely inaccessible.
      •    Mubarak about to speak.
