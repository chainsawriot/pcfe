Chelsea,

I just wanted to thankyou for the opportunity that was given to our group of student here at XIDP DC AI% ACADEIIT:
After having discussions with them regarding the conference it appears that they were inspired and empowered to continue on a
path of women empowerment and growth.
 Many of them had great ideas on what they coufd do as young girls to help with this movement. (Starting a group here at the
schoof whichfocuses on women/girl issues).
Aho having more of a voice in the world: Jam excited to continue this momentum with them and see it evofve.

On another note,
As a woman, to Be amongst so many poweul women who are al f making impacts in their countries across the globe truly
inspired me.
I will now fookto see what more I can do to continue to make an impact in this countly.


Aft 3 women on the panel was admirable and inspiring with their own tales of accomplishments and personal journeys.

Secretaty Clinton has always been a poweuf azfer that I have looked up to throughout the years, so I was grate.fuffor the
opportunity to Be in her presence.
