BEIRUT (AP) - Lebanon's president accepted the resignation of Western-backed Prime Minister Saad Hariri's
Cabinet following the resignation of Hezbollah ministers and their allies, which forced the government to
collapse.
   President Michel Suleiman's office said in a statement that the president asked Hariri to continue managing
the country's day-to-day affairs in a caretaker capacity until a new cabinet is formed.
   Consultations over the choice of a new prime minister were to begin January 13.
