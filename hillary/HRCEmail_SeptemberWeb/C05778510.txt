If we can get the language changed (e.g. illegal vs illegitimate) and a commitment from the Pals not to pursue similar
resolution, we have a rationale for abstention, including with the Israelis — although they won't like it. In that connection, it
could be decisive with the Pals if the Europeans were to say that they would abstain if this were brought to the UNSC
under current circumstances. We would have to work it hard with relevant folks here and in Israel.

If we are unable to change the language, on balance I would veto. If we abstain on a resolution that is contrary to our
position, after we have suggested we would veto, it will appear that we are acting in reaction to the situation on the
ground. I think that would make us appear weak rather than strong. It is hard to articulate a rationale for abstention that
does not suggest that this is a retreat in response to events. In Israel, that would be seen as the first manifestation of the
"post- Mubarak" order, and reinforce the narrative of abandonment, perhaps contributing to an atmosphere in Israel that
produces unhelpful steps of their own in reaction to the current crisis.
