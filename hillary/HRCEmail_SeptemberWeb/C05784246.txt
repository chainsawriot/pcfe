â€¢ ISLAMABAD (AP) - A senior Pakistani police official says authorities have not been able to determine
  whether the men who kidnapped an American development expert were criminals or Islamic militants.
    Ahmed Raza Tahir, the police chief in the eastern city of Lahore where Warren Weinstein was abducted, said
  on Tuesday that the kidnappers have not contacted authorities or made any ransom demands.
    Tahir says police are still questioning Weinstein's driver and the four men who were guarding his house when
  he was taken to determine whether they played any role.
    The U.S. Embassy said FBI agents in the country are working with Pakistani authorities to locate Weinstein.
    The 70-year-old development expert was seized from his house by gunmen before dawn on Saturday.
