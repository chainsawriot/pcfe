Subject: Final foreign affairs article w/ their proposed cuts and our proposed responses

Attached is the final version that we sent in with all their proposed edits and our responses marked in track changes and
explained in comments. I have also included 2 additional small edits that I think will help immunize us from complaints
by the human rights/democracy crowd. If you can let me know by early tomorrow whether you approve or what you
want to change I can them make the necessary changes on the document they sent back to us and send it in my the
deadline late tomorrow. Jim Hoge likes the piece and told me that he took a personal hand in the editing. AM
