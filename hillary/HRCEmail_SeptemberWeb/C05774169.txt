Subject:                            Updates



A few quick updates during what has been a thankfully pretty quiet week in the world.

    1.
                                          I'm giving it to you in this shape because I would very much like your steer on
          whether it is headed in the right or wrong direction, and your guidance on
          changes/additions/subtractions. Happy to discuss at your convenience. I'm sharing a copy of Bill, Jim, Derek,
          and CDM.

    2.




    3.




    4. I am sending for your review a draft memo prepared by SRAP on the various political/diplomatic processes
       underway in AfPak.

    5.




    6. Finally, I am sending readouts of Jeff s conversations with Adel and Saad Hariri on Lebanon that are worth your
        read.
