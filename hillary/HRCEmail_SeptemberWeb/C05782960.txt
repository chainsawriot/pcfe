Subject: Libyan forces say raised flag in Bani Walid (Reuters)

TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libyan interim government forces entered the pro-Muammar Gaddafi bastion of Bath
Walid on Sunday and raised Libya's new flag, a senior military commander said.

   "We have reached the city centre (of Bani Walid) and have raised the flag," Colonel Abdullah Naker, head of
the Tripoli Revolutionist Council, told Reuters.

   Fighters from a brigade taking part in the assault on Bani Walid also told Reuters they had entered the
town.

   Bani Walid is -- along with Gaddafi's hometown of Sirte -- one of only two remaining towns in Libya
resisting the rule of the National Transitional Council (NTC).
