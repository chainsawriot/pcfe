Jake, I've made the point that the freely associated state of Palau votes with the US in the UN more than any General
Assembly Member. Attached is a memo distilled from the annual State Dept. report on UN voting during 2009
substantiating this. Palau voted with the US 100% in the 12 key votes, more than any other nation. The issues
concerned Cuba, Israel and other Middle Eastern matters, human rights, and nuclear proliferation. In 2008, the two
nations that voted with the U.S. more than any other UN Member were Palau and Israel.

Happy New Year! Jeff
