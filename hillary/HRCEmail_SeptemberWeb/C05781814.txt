See below readout of EU meeting on Syria sanctions today. Bottom line — they are headed in the right
direction. Question is timing.

Looks like some focused work is paying off. This would put a real dent in the cash flow.

Hi all,

I just received a readout from a key official who was at today's PSC meeting which just ended. Key
takeaway is that the EU has decided to move ahead with strengthening sanctions. \                  1.4(B)
                                                                                                   1.4(D)
                                                                                                   B1




The PSC also reported a general satisfaction with the international community coordination efforts
leading up to yesterday's political statements. They also noted significant praise for outreach to the
countries in the region.

I'm sure you guys are all over this despite it being a Friday during Europe's collective August vacation, but if any of you
have a chance to get a readout of the EU sanctions discussion in Brussels from your contacts before heading home for
the day, we'd be intensely grateful.
