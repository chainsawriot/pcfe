Henry Kissinger just ended the Afpak panel at the Trilateral Commission this morning with a quite lovely extemp eulogy
to RCH -- "a great idealist who will be admired and loved and who would have made a tremendous contribution on
[Afpak] had fate allowed him to continue.... We should ask our Chairman to write a letter to his wife expressing the pride
and gratitude we all feel for his service."
