Cherylâ€”


That was very helpful this morning. Many thanks for the time.


I saw Judith afterward, and she shares my concern on the CSCC issue. She was going to ask for a meeting with S with the
two of us to discuss, which I support. I do hope we can do a separate meeting on the broader CT issues with S as well
soon, per our discussion.

Bests,


DB
