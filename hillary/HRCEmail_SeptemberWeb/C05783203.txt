Subject: UK's Hague: No progress on Quartet Mideast statement (Reuters)


NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Middle East Quartet of peace negotiators has made no progress on a statement to
avoid a showdown between Palestinians and Israelis over Palestinian plans to seek full U.N. statehood, Britain's
foreign secretary said September 20.

   William Hague told reporters that the objective of the Quartet -- the United States, Russia, European Union
and United Nations -- is to get the Israelis and Palestinians back to the negotiating table.

   "There is no progress (within the Quartet) to report as we speak," he said ahead of a meeting with Palestinian
President Mahmoud Abbas on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.
