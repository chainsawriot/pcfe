I just got the June 17 version. I do not have a call sheet for Landrieu that is update w info about American parents
waiting to adopt children from Guatemala which is what she wants to discuss. Pls ask CA for info about what she means
when she says 400 families are waiting and have not been helped by the State Dept.
