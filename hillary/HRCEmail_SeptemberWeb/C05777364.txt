WASHINGTON (AP) - A man has been arrested in Canada and accused of conspiring to kill Americans abroad
and of supporting a terrorist network in Iraq responsible for the deaths of five American soldiers.
   The Justice Department says Faruq Khalil Muhammad 'Isa is accused of supporting the group that drove a
truck laden with explosives to the gate of the U.S. Military's Forward Operating Base Marez in Mosul, Iraq. The
Tunisian jihadist driving the truck was alongside the last vehicle in a U.S. convoy when the explosives went off.
