Subject: Palestinian: US warns of aid cut for statehood bid (AP)


JERUSALEM (AP) - A Palestinian official says the United States has warned it will stop financial support if the
Palestinians go ahead with a unilateral bid for statehood in September.
   Senior Palestinian official Saeb Erekat said the U.S. Consul-General in Jerusalem, Daniel Rubinstein, told
him Friday that the U.S. will take "punitive measures" if the Palestinians proceed with seeking U.N. recognition
of statehood. Erekat said Rubinstein warned the U.S. will stop granting the Palestinians an annual aid package
of $470 million. The U.S. consulate said it had no immediate comment.
   Israel and the U.S. strongly oppose the Palestinians U.N. plan, saying Palestinian statehood should only be
achieved through negotiations. They maintain that a Palestinian state must emerge from Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations, which have been stalled for almost a year.
