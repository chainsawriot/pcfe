Subject: Police say rocket fired into Afghanistan capital (AP)

KABUL, Afghanistan - (AP) Afghan police say a rocket fired into the Afghan capital landed on the grounds
of the presidential palace. It's unclear Whether the rocket caused any casualties or damage.
   Mohammad Zahir, the chief of criminal investigation for the Kabul police, confirmed that at least one rocket
landed in the capital early Wednesday morning.
   Ezatullah, an Afghan police officer at the scene, told The Associated Press that the rocket landed inside the
presidential palace compound.
   Another police official in that district of the capital also confirmed that it landed within the perimeter of the
spacious presidential palace compound. That police official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the
political nature of the information.
