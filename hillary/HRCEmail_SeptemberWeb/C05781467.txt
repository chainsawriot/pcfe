Cheryl: I have an excellent relationship with Senator Coons, brief him at least once a month on key issues, and do not
understand why (if the attached email is accurate) he would say/suggest I or someone in the Bureau did not inform him
about the Secretary's trip. Checking my records, I met last met with Senator Coons on May 17th in his office. At that
time I briefed him on his forthcoming trip to Ghana, Benin and Abuja over the Memorial Day recess.
  I remember telling him that the Secretary would be going to the AGOA Forum in Lusaka and to Tanzania and possibly
several East other African countries. ( I was not specific about the other stops because they were still up In the air at the
time.) Coons said the AGOA trip sounded interesting, but he was committed to traveling with Senator Johnny Isakson,
the Chairman of the Senate's Africa Subcommittee, who has also been very supportive our policies. I also mentioned
the prospects of the First Lady's trip in broad strokes.) The AF legislative officer also calls on Senator Coon's staff at
least two or three times a month. Since Senator Coon's return from Africa, his staff has called to express his sincere
appreciation for the outstanding support he received from our embassies and the Bureau. I intend to give Coons a back
brief on the Secretary's trip and will make sure he feels our love. Johnnie

Cheryl,

I had dinner last with Chris Coons. As you know, he is the chair of the Africa subcommittee at SFRC. He mentioned that â€¢
he only heard by happenstance of HRC's upcoming visit to Africa for the AGOA forum, and that no one had reached out
to him from State to let him know of the trip, or to invite him to consider attending. He is quite passionate about Africa
and development issues, and just returned from a Codel to the continent with Jonny Isaakson.

He also mentioned that at a recent event with a group of Senators, he was the only one whom HRC didn't recognize and
greet by name. (He reminded her that he was "the one who beat the witch.")

Chris is not a big-ego, high-maintenance guy, but he seemed a bit miffed as he described this.

Just an FYI for a chance for some relationship-building.
