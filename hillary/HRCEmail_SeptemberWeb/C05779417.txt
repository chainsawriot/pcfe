Ploughshares provided a significant amount of funding to us and others... and carried out a lot of organizing on their
own for passage of New START... We would not have had the resources to build the Generals/Admirals/Clergy voices
including op-eds, fly-ins for Hill visits, letters, calls, etc without Ploughshares... They're in a decision mode now on how
much to resource for supporting ATT... My request, if possible/appropriate, is a Thank You letter to them... Here (below)
are names and address if possible... As always, thank you so much for considering...
