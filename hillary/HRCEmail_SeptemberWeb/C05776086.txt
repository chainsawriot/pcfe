Dearest Madame Secretary,
I am in Abu Dhabi, watching you on television with Prime Minister Natanyaou. You are looking so well ! You are more
and more impressive...I am so proud of you !
We are planning our Women of the World Conference again for next March. On Saturday night, March 12th, I will be
having the 2nd DVF Award at a dinner at the UN. 2 of the recipients will be women from Vital Voices, one will be voted
by people on line and the fourth one is the special one give to formidable example of courage and leadership. Last year
it was given to Ingrid Betancourt by Meryll Streep.
More than anything, I would love if you would be willing to accept that award. YOU are such an example of strength.
leadership and spirit to all of us women.
Am I dreaming or would you be willing to accept it ?
Lots of love
Diane
