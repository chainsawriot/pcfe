See below from PJ this am, based on his review of coverage. (We will provide updates on the 7 am call, and ask the
ambassador to join.)



I believe the interviews will lean heavily on the authorized departure, the rumored Mubarak departure for Sharm, a
political matket that expects Mubarak to cede the presidency to Suleiman and with two shoes now dropped in the
region (three if one counts Lebanon), what's next? Coming back to the message of reform, drawing from her Doha
speech, will send the right message. These are decisions that will be made in the region, based on unique circumstances
country by country, but reform is vital.PJ
