Subject: Pres Tadic of Serbia

Bosnian President mentioned that Palestinians are leaning on Tadic to lean on Bosnian Serb member of the tri-
presidency to vote yes on full membership for Palestine in the UNSC. Thus far the Bosnian Serb has been opposed.
Since there is no consensus, Bosnia would abstain in the UNSC. Apparently Pals are telling Tadic that a number of Arab
states would recognize Kosovo if Serbia and Bosnian Serbs do not support.
