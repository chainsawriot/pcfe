                                                                                May 12, 2011

             Handing-over of the Charge of Managing Director


        I am today relinquishing the post of Managing Director of Grameen
  Bank on the basis that the Deputy Managing Director Mrs. Nurjahan Begum
  would hold charge until a Managing Director is appointed in accordance with
  the procedures under section 14 of the Grameen Bank ordinance. Since the
  board of Grameen Bank is my appointing authority, it may take appropriate
  steps.

        I have still not received the Appellate Division's full order. I am taking
  this step without prejudice to the legal issues raised before the Supreme
  Court, and in order to prevent undue disruption of the activities of Grameen
  Bank and to ensure my colleagues and our 8 million members, and owners of
  the bank, are not subjected to any difficulty in discharging their
  responsibilities.

       I hope Grameen Bank will continue to operate maintaining its
  independence and character under the Grameen Bank Ordinance and move
  towards even greater success.




                                                                           (Signed)
                                                                   (Dr. Muhammad Yunus)
                                                                      Managing Director
                                                                        Grameen Bank
