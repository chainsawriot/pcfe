Subject: Sherman QFRs

After lots of negotiation at the Member level, Senators Kerry and Lugar appear prepared to go forward with an SFRC
Business Meeting next Tuesday, September 13.

There is one important condition. A notice will go out to all Committee members that instructs them that all QFRs must
be submitted to the State Department before COB tomorrow. Furthermore, the Department commits to answering all
outstanding QFRs by 00B Monday, September 12.

What this means is that people will need to work on QFR answers over the weekend. In fact, to ensure that Wendy has
ample time to review the answers Sunday afternoon, I would propose all QFR responses be submitted by Saturday
evening.

Know this is a tight deadline and that this likely will ruin some weekends, but this is a priority and we've gotten a very
significant accommodation from the Chairman an Ranking Member.

Thanks.
