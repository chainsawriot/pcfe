STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON

15th Anniversary of Srebrenica Genocide

Today we remember the tragic events in Srebrenica fifteen years ago. I join President Obama and the people of the
United States in offering our deepest condolences on this most solemn occasion. We honor the memories of the victims
and mourn with their families.

The United States stands with Bosnia and Herzegovina, and all countries in the region who wish to foster peace and
reconciliation. We remain committed to ensuring that those responsible for these crimes face justice. We recognize that
there can be no lasting peace without justice. It is only by bringing all responsible parties to account for their crimes that
we will truly honor Srebrenica's victims.

We are duty-bound — to the victims, to their surviving family members, and to future generations — to prevent such
atrocities from happening again. Our common faith in the value of freedom and peace unifies us and drives us to act.
That is why we are committed to working with all the communities that make up Bosnia and Herzegovina to move
forward and build a pluralistic, democratic state that can take its rightful place in the Euro-Atlantic community. A
prosperous, free, and unified Bosnia and Herzegovina is the most worthy monument to those who lost their lives at
Srebrenica and the best guarantee against such a tragedy ever repeating itself.
