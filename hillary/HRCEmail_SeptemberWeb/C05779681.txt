(SBU) According to Emirati Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) "Friends of Yemen"
April 3 meeting in Riyadh concluded with a decision to deploy the ambassadors of the six GCC member countries in
Yemen April 4 to meet with members of President Saleh's government and the opposition. During their meetings, the
GCC will present the following three-step plan:

1) call for Saleh to hand over powers to his Vice President (does not have to be the current VP but whomever he
names) and step down, although not immediately as the opposition is demanding;

2) Saleh and his family would get full immunity even though there is no mention of immunity in the Yemeni
constitution and this could pose legal problems; and

3)   the formation of a national unity government led by the opposition.




(SBU) Foreign Minister Zayed added the GCC will invite all parties to come and meet in Saudi Arabia (at an unspecified
date) and will use the three outlined steps as the basis for talks. Although the Foreign Minister indicated the three-step
proposal was approved by all six GCC member countries, he did not, however, respond to Assistant Secretary Feltman's
inquiry regarding whether the three-step proposal included input from the opposition, youth, and people from the
street.
