Subject: NATO: Bomb kills 5 NATO troops, 4 Afghan soldiers (AP)

KABUL (AP) - NATO officials say a suicide bomber killed five soldiers from the international coalition outside
a military base in eastern Afghanistan. Afghan military officials say the same blast also killed four of its
soldiers and wounded four others. The Taliban has claimed responsibility for the attack. Afghan Defense
Ministry spokesman Gen. Mohammad Zahir Azimi said Saturday the bomber was wearing an Afghan army
uniform when he approached the entrance to the joint Afghan and coalition forces military base in Laghman
province just west of Jalalabad and blew himself up. NATO said it will withhold release of further information
on the service members pending notification of their next of kin. Four translators were also injured.
