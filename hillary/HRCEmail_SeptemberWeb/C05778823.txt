Subject: Abbas says he won't run for re-election (AP)

RAMALLAH (AP) - The Palestinian president says he won't run for re-election. This is the first time Mahmoud
Abbas has said explicitly he won't seek another term.
  In a speech Wednesday to political allies, Abbas also said he is willing to travel to the Gaza Strip to promote
reconciliation between the feuding Palestinian territories and form a united government.
  Abbas' plan includes new elections within six months. But he says he wouldn't run for president again.
  However, it's not clear that elections will be held because Abbas says they cannot take place if the West Bank
and Gaza don't reunite.
