The Settlement Freeze That Never Was, And Never Will Be <http://maxblumenthal.com/2010/07/the-settlement-freeze-

Linda Forsell's photos of ongoing construction in the Israeli settlement of Har Homa expose the illusion of a settlement
freeze <http://maxblumenthal.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/har-homaLjpg>
Linda Forsell's June 21 photos of ongoing construction in the Israeli settlement of Har Homa expose the illusion of
Netanyahu's settlement freeze With the Israeli settlement moratorium scheduled to expire on September 26, the right-
wing parties in Israel's coalition government are exerting maximum pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to
block the policy's renewal. "Let's get rid of the freeze and get back to building," declared Israeli Minister of Public Affairs
and the Diaspora Yuli Edelstein <http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2003/2/Yuli+Edelstein.htm> on
Israel National Radio yesterday. "It's our land anyway!" (Edelstein lives in the settlement of Neve Daniel).
Back in the US, the former Israel lobbyist <http://www.rightweb.irc-
online.org/profile/Washington_Institute_for_Near_East_Policy> and ex-Clinton Assistant Secretary of State Martin
Indyk took to the Washington Post's op-ed page to praise Netanyahu <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-
dyn/content/article/2010/07/01/AR2010070104376.html> and Barack Obama for ensuring that "there were zero
building starts in the West Bank settlements."
During the week of June 21, I traveled through the West Bank with Swedish photojournalist Linda Forsell
<http://lindaforsell.com/> to document new settlement construction and the settlers' theft of water from Palestinian
towns. Forsell took a series of photos at Har Homa, a massive Israeli settlement towering over the Palestinian town of
Beit Sarhour. Her photos show ongoing construction of hundreds of new settlement units â€” documents of the
settlement freeze sham.
har homa2 <http://maxblumenthal.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/har-homa2.jpg> Netanyahu authorized the
 building <http://www.thestarcom/news/world/article/743544--israel-plans-new-homes-in-jerusalem > of new
settlement units just days after he announced the freeze <http://www.haaretz.cominews/netanyahu-declares-10-
 month-settlement-freeze-to-restart-peace-talks-1.3435> in November 2009. He attempted to disguise new settlement
construction by drawing a false distinction between the West Bank and "parts of Jerusalem" like Har Homa that actually
 lie outside 1967 lines. As Israeli government flack Mark Regev remarked
 <http://www.thestarcom/news/world/article/743544--israel-plans-new-homes-in-jerusalem> in December 2009,
 "We've made a clear distinction between the West Bank and Jerusalem. Jerusalem is our capital and will stay as such."
 With a few exceptions <http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/10/world/middleeast/10biden.html> , Obama allowed this
 scheme to go forward.

According to the Washington Post, Obama's meeting with Netanyahu this week will have more to do with reassuring
Jewish Democrats <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-
dyn/content/article/2010/07/05/AR2010070501958.html?hpid=topnews> than with halting the wholesale colonization
of the West Bank. As the Post's Anne Kornblut reported <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-
dyn/content/article/2010/07/05/AR2010070501958_2.html?hpid=topnews> , "The White House meeting will not dwell
on some of the most difficult time-sensitive issues, including the expiration of a moratorium on Israeli settlement
construction in September." This may mean an end to the settlement freeze, but it was only an illusion after all.
