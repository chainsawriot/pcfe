In the midst of everything, I want to say thank you for everything you all did today w/ orphans but really with everything
since the quake hit.

You make us all stand a little taller and am grateful.

Pat, I'm beginning to wonder about               He called with a frantic request for assistance because kids had been
left behind. Now we hear that they are on the plane.

The Governor and the children are on their way to the United States. Thank you very much for all of your assistance. I
know that this was a huge diversion from an already overwhelming set of circumstances. Your help was invaluable --
these kids will make it because of what you did to help get them out of Haiti.

The issue is NOT U.S., contrary to what has been represented. We require some approvals from Haitian govt - am
working to try to secure.

Importance: High

If you have a moment we have a bit of a urgent matter -- you may know we are attempting to bring about sixty children
from Haiti -- they are orphans (per dating the earthquake) that resided in an orphanage managed by two women from
Pittsburgh who are affiliated with the Catholic church.

The military has been very helpful and the plane to pick up the children will be landing in Haiti at 5:40 -- the Governor is
on that plane because he was told the Haitian officials would not release the children (due to the short notice) without
the Governor taking personal responsibility for their well being.

He began this effort by communicating with the state department to ensure their cooperation and in spite of them being
very overwhelmed, they have been extremely helpful to our efforts to move this children to safety in the U.S.

However, we just learned via the military that the counsel general in the embassy is not willing to process the paperwork
for all the children who have home plans in the U.S. We don't know the exact reasons why. We are attempting to reach
Huma at State since she's been involved but we cannot reach her. Our question is whether you have someway to help
us reach Huma or anyone else who could help us resolve this matter with the counsel general so the children can be
released.

I can be reached at
