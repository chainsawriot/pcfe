If we go to Paris,



Also, if we go to Paris, I assume I will come back that same night. If that's right, can I either land at Westchester or fly up
from Andrews?

If I don't go to Paris, how will we add one more trip since I doubt I can go to Haiti?

Are we now thinking of flying to Munich Thursday night instead of Fri morning?

When I go to Hawaii for APEC,
                         Huma has contact info.

Is there a set date for the Friends of Yemen in Saudi Arabia?

Are we still thinking of a speech about Latin America? If so, should do before mid-March. What's status of Brookings
event for former Lat Am leaders?

Sending you copy of letter from Dick Blum inviting me to speak at his poverty center at Berkeley.

Also need to find out dates for Japanese PM visit from WH.
