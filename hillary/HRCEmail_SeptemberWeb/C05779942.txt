Subject: UN: Libya must stop attacks on civilian targets (Reuters)

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The U.N. chief Sunday demanded an end to "indiscriminate" attacks against
civilians in Libya and warned Tripoli that anyone who violates international law will be brought to justice.

   U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed former Foreign Minister of Jordan, Abdelilah Al-Khatib, as
his special envoy to Libya "to undertake urgent consultations with the authorities in Tripoli and in the region on
the immediate humanitarian situation," Ban's press office said.

   The statement added that Ban spoke with Libyan Foreign Minister Musa Kusa Sunday and told him that
Tripoli must "uphold their responsibility to protect the country's citizens and to heed the Libyan people's
legitimate aspirations to live in dignity and peace."

  Ban and Kusa agreed that the United Nations would immediately dispatch a team to Tripoli to assess the
humanitarian situation in Libya.
