UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The UN chief "deplores" Israel's demolition of the Shepherd Hotel in East
Jerusalem and said it only served to heighten tensions between Israel and the Palestinians, a UN spokesman said
January 10. "It is deeply regrettable that growing international concern at unilateral expansion of illegal Israeli
settlements is not being heeded," UN spokesman Martin Nesirky said in a statement summarizing Secretary-
General Ban Ki-moon's reaction to the Israeli move.
