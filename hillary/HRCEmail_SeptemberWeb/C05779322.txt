Hillary:
Per our conversation yesterday, please see Tim Wirth's response to Chris Smith's op-ed last Saturday in the WPost.
Others from the Global Leaders Council on Reproductive Health chaired by Mary Robinson (I am an ex officio
member)are also responding to the article.

Onward!

Maria: Per our discussion today, I sent the attached to the Washington Post on Monday. Now we just have to hope that
they print it!




Good to see you and hope to see you again soon. T




In his Sunday op-ed, Chris Smith politicized the broadly-accepted Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).




Contrary to Smith's assertions, access to legal abortion will not be on the agenda of the MDG Summit this week in New
York. The key UN document on this issue makes clear that nations have the right to set their own abortion laws. Instead,
world leaders will focus on how to rid the world of extreme poverty and hunger and to make dramatic improvement to
the health of women and children around the globe.

Ensuring access to health services, including modern family planning, can play a critically important role in saving the
lives of women. In fact, it can reduce 40% of maternal deaths worldwide. More than two hundred million women in the
developing world want access to family planning, but can't get it. This has a dramatic impact, increasing deaths during
childbirth, leaving millions of newborns behind.
                                                                                                                           1



Listening to the voices of women in the developing world, not injecting American domestic politics into the MDG
Summit, is the surest way to promote the goals on which we can all agree.




Timothy E. Wirth, Washington
The writer is president of the United Nations Foundation.
