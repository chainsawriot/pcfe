Mike-

Is it possible to make sure Secretary Clinton receives a copy of this?

I know she and Jerry were good friends, and I was with Jerry when she took it upon herself to personally call Jerry and
congratulate him when he was elected President of the ABA. I'm sure she would like to have a statement issued
expressing condolences and recognizing his achievements in the field of human rights and generally.

Thanks very much. Let's get together in the near future. Is there any chance you will be able to make the Sunday
service?

Steve Walther
