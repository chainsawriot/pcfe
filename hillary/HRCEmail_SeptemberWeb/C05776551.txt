Jake,

Kind of a zoo here, as it is for you. Between HFAC and Wikileaks and 5+1 next week, it's not dull. As Cheryl may have
mentioned,                                                                                                              B5



I really admire what HRC is doing on all this. It's not easy, and she's bearing the brunt of it.

DOD still in denial over their lapses, and their tendency to lowball damage in public is really unhelpful.

Sent Megan a number of suggestions for Manama speech, which is shaping up well.

All best,

Bill
