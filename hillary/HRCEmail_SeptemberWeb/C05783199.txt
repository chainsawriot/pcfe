Subject: Yemen's capital relatively calm after cease-fire (AP)


SANAA (AP) - Witnesses and security officials say the Yemeni capital is mostly calm after a cease-fire
negotiated by the country's vice president and several Western ambassadors came took effect.
  The cease-fire came into force at 4 p.m. local time September 20. The city has since been calm, with only
sporadic gunfire.
   The cease-fire came on the third day of deadly violence between opponents of the Yemeni regime and forces
loyal to its embattled president. At least 60 people have been killed, most of them protesters.
   The truce was negotiated by Vice President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi and several foreign envoys, including
the U.S. and British ambassadors in Sanaa, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because
they were not authorized to speak to reporters.
