Cheryl

Just back from my first hugely successful International Fund for Ireland meeting in Ireland and want
you to convey to Secretary Clinton that the Irish love her as much as ever. They talk about her
constantly and asked me repeatedly me to tell them more about her activities and agenda. They
clearly think she is one of them and they have proprietary rights to her.
Unfortunately, the relentless attacks on the Fund by Ms. Vargo are having an effect on the Hill and we
are working hard to counter her irrational obsession with terminating the Fund. Congressman Neal is
leading the effort with the support of the majority of the House, the Senate and the Irish and British
Ambassadors. As we head into another CR, it would be very helpful if the Secretary would mention
her support to Sens. Kerry, Leahy, Durbin etc. between now and the St. Patrick's Day festivities.
I had hoped to meet you at the Kris Balderston swearing in but perhaps will see you at the Women of
Courage reception next Tuesday.
Regards
Stella
