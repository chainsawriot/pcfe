Subject: Libya sees some progress in talks with rebels (AP)

TRIPOLI (AP) - A senior official in Moammar Gadhafi's government says Libyan officials and rebels are
making progress in talks aimed at stopping four months of fighting.
  Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim told reporters in the capital Tripoli on Monday that talks between the
two sides have been taking place for about two months.
  He says the aim of the discussions taking place outside Libya and over the phone is to halt hostilities, get the
country back to normal and set a framework for further dialogue.
  Kaim says some NATO members have complicated efforts because they don't support negotiations. He also
says the talks are being hindered because the rebels do not speak with one voice.
