Subject: Russia says opposed to any UN Syria resolution (Reuters)


MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia said it opposed any UN Security Council resolution on Syria, stepping up its
threat to veto a Western-backed draft condemning the country's crackdown on protesters. "Russia is against
any UN Security Council resolution on Syria," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich
told journalists at a briefing in Moscow.
   "We do not believe the Syrian issue is a subject for consideration by the Security Council, let alone the
adoption of some kind of resolution," he said. "The situation in this country, in our view, does not present a
threat to international peace and security."
    Britain, France, Germany and Portugal have floated a new resolution condemning Syria at the UN Security
Council as the United States and its allies seek to raise the pressure on Syria to end its violent crackdown on
anti-government protesters.
