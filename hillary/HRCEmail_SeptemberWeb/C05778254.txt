Subject: Freed Yemeni activist vows more action vs president (Reuters)

SANAA (Reuters) - A Yemeni rights activist vowed to continue her struggle against Yemen's long-serving
president, hours after being released following protests in the capital. Inspired by the recent ouster of Tunisia's
long-time ruler, Tawakul 'Carman, a journalist and member of the Islamist party Islah, had called for President
Saleh to step down and led rallies at Sanaa University last week. She was detained on January 23. "We will
continue this struggle and the Jasmine Revolution until the removal of this corrupt system that looted the wealth
of the Yemenis," Karman told hundreds of protesters demanding the release of other detainees. Karman was
freed on a guarantee from her family, a security official said.
