Subject: Egypt judge postpones Mubarak hearing to Sept. 5 (Reuters)

CAIRO (Reuters) - The judge trying Egypt's former President Hosni Mubarak for the killing of protesters
wrapped up Monday's session and said the court would reconvene on September 5 to begin hearing evidence in
the case.

   Judge Ahmed Refaat ordered that the trial be merged with that of former Interior Minister Habib el-Adli and
said TV coverage of the trial would end until sentencing takes place.

   "Preposterous!," said Sherif Mohamed, an engineer watching the trial outside the court building. "The case is
necessary for public opinion. Not airing it live means there is a deal with Mubarak."
