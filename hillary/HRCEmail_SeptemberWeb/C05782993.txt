  Subject: Afghan lawmakers OK funds for Kabul Bank bailout (AP)


  KABUL (AP) - Afghan lawmakers have agreed to reimburse the government for bailing out the Kabul Bank,
  which nearly collapsed last year.
     The lower house on Saturday passed a bill to provide up to $825 million over the next eight years to
  recapitalize Afghanistan's central bank.
     The bank's troubles began after reports that top bank executives issued more than $800 million worth of
  questionable loans to shareholders, Afghan officials and friends.
     Finance Minister Omar Zalchilwal says he hopes Saturday's decision will lead the International Monetary
  Fund to extend Afghanistan a new line of credit.
     Afghanistan has been without IMF backing for more than a year, threatening to choke off billions in aid to
  the country.
     Zakhilwal says $70 million worth of questionable loans has been recovered.
