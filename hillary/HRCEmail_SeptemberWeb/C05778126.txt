Subject: GOM has now officially proposed meeting with Calderon

SRE has just called me and proposed a meeting with President Calderon.

The are suggesting a meeting in Mexico City at 7:30 for 30 minutes. The purpose would be to report on the
results of the meeting in Guanajuato.

The participants would be Calderon, the Secretary, Espinosa and the two ambassadors.

To accommodate this, the GOM proposes to reduce the time for the first meeting bloc in Guanajuato and to
shorten the press conference.

Assuming this is agreeable, I would ask that Bernadette work out the schedule changes with the advance team
in Guanajuato.
