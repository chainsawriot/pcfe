 Subject: Netanyahu repeats Israel cannot return to '67 borders (Reuters)



  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Monday again rejected U.S. President
• Barack Obama's vision of a Middle East peace deal based on the country's "indefensible" 1967 borders.

    Netanyahu, speaking to Washington's most powerful pro-Israel lobbying group, said he planned to outline in
 a speech to Congress on Tuesday his own vision for an eventual peace between Israel and the Palestinians.

  • "It must leave Israel with security, and therefore Israel cannot return to the indefensible 1967 lines,"
 Netanyahu said.
