Subject: Suspect in plot to kill Karzai was not a bodyguard (AP)


KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) - The Afghan president's office says a man accused of plotting to kill President
Hamid Karzai was not one of his personal bodyguards, as intelligence officials had initially said.
   Karzai's office said Saturday the suspect was a member of the palace protection unit but that he was assigned
to an outer gate of the presidential complex and had no access to the heavily secured palace.
   Afghan intelligence officials announced Wednesday that they had broken up a cell that was planning to
assassinate Karzai. They had said that a palace bodyguard from Karzai's hometown of Karz was among six
people they arrested.
   The others included a Kabul University professor and three college students. The officials said all had ties to
militant groups.
