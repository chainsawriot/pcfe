Subject: FBI arrests Va. man, said on Pakistani spy payroll (AP)


WASHINGTON (AP) - A federal law enforcement official says a Virginia man is under arrest, charged with
getting money from Pakistan's spy agency and acting as an unregistered foreign lobbyist for the Pakistani
government.
   The official identified the man as Syed Fai of Fairfax, Va.
   The arrest adds new strain to the already difficult relationship between the U.S. and Pakistan, which suffered
after the U.S. found Osama bin Laden hiding inside Pakistan and killed him without telling the government
there.
   The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing and court documents
have not been released.
