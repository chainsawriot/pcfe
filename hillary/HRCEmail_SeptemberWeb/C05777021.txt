Do you think you and an S/RAP ( and DOD? WH?)team in DC should offer to brief them on the Hill before they go?

As I believe you know, Senator McConnell is leading a delegation of newly elected R Senators (listed below) to Islamabad
and Kabul next week. I have had several conversations with the team in Islamabad about their concerns in terms of any
planned or unplanned interactions with Pakistanni media while the Senators are there.

Given the highly volatile situation in Islamabad at the moment, and the very challenging media enviroinment in Pakistan,
we are doing everything we can to try and prepare them for what they might encounter. However, we all remain
concerned that they may not fully appreciate what they will face or how their remarks will be interpreted or, frankly,
deliberately misinterpreted.

I'll keep you posted as things move forward. Let me know if you have any other thoughts or suggestions.

Hope your trip goes well.

CODEL McConnell will be in Pakistan the end of next week. He will be traveling with:

Senator Richard Burr (R-NC)

Senator-elect Pat Toomey (R-PA)

Senator-elect Marco Rubio (R-FL)

Senator-elect Ron Johnson (R-WI)

Senator-elect Kelly Ayotte (R-NH )

Mr. Thomas Hawkins, National Security Advisor, Office of the Republican Leader

Mr. Roy E. Brownell, Legislative Assistant, Office of Senator McConnell




Due to the tense political situation over the past few weeks in Pakistan, the Embassy remains concerned about
managing the press around the trip given Pakistan's volatile media. SRAP is working on a phone call from Dan Feldman
to McConnell's senior foreign policy staffer and will raise the issue. We are also consulting with the embassy to see
whether a pre-trip phone call from Munter to McConnell would help to give the traveling party a sense of what they're
heading into before they hit the ground. As side note, Amb. Eikenberry will be traveling back to the U.S. and wanted to
brief members before their trip but will not arrive until after the CODEL departs.
