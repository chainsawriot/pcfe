Mrs. Golding his mother use to teach me at high school. She even volunteered to give me free tutoring in
spelling. She failed at teaching me to spell but she taught me so much more.
I will be taking trees to Haiti in August to one of the Clinton foundation contacts, a great group in the north of
Haiti.
Thank you. Enjoy Italy
