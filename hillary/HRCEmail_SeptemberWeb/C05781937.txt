I had asked my team to follow up on the Specter letter that came up in today's staff meeting. Peter worked with 10 on
it, and developed the below...

I meant to send this to you last week and it slipped off my radar.

lake--

Absolutely. I'm going to work on this with Christopher Le Mon, Esther's Senior Adviser, who has also recently been doing
other work on U.N.
appointment issues and also thinking about how to get more out of the UN Department of Political Affairs, which we
currently under-use.

Subject: Specter letter

Peter - Specter sent S a letter on something called the Mediation Support Unit at the UN (apparently it's in their public
affairs shop).
He proposes using it in Syria. Leaving aside Syria, S is (1) interested in whether we can breathe real life into it and what
that would look like. She is also (2) interested in building a roster of highly skilled American mediators, like Ken
Feinberg, who could be seconded to the unit to work on things like Cyprus.

Can you do some digging on (1) and some thinking on good candidates for (2)?
