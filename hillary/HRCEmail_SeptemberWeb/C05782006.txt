Subject: France aims to host Libya transition summit-minister (Reuters)


PARIS (Reuters) - France aims to host a meeting of international partners as soon as next week to discuss a
roadmap for the future of Libya, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said on Monday.

   Juppe said it was not yet clear whether Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was still in Tripoli and called on his
supporters to lay down their arms.

   "We propose an extraordinary meeting of the contact group at the highest level as soon as next week to lay
out an action plan with the Libyan authorities," the minister said.

   French President Nicolas Sarkozy will speak by telephone later on Monday with Mahmoud Jibril, leader of
Libya's National Transitional Council, and Jibril is expected in Paris "in the coming days", Juppe said.
