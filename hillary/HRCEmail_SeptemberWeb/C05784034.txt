Subject: Fwd: Fw: Confidential info and request RE Syria

Jeff and Ron:(and joining Bill and Jake) I am in London, where my Counselor Sarah Cleveland and I met on Friday with a
very prominent constitutional law professor and Barrister Jeffrey Jowell. He knows Wasfik Said, a prominent Syrian who
endowed the Business School at Oxford, and was asked to go to Syria to meet with Assad recently. He briefed the British
FCO on this issue. He told us that, at the request of Assad and his political adviser, Jowell and a few Syrian constitutional
lawyers drafted the attached document for Assad's consideration The key language is:
I am now establishing an independent Commission, composed of 9 experts, to draft a new constitution containing the
above- mentioned principles. The Commission will work in a transparent and open manner, and has the right to consult
with whomever it will. The draft Constitution will be submitted to a national referendum as soon as possible.
 The new Constitution will adopt the following guidelines:
1)       The introduction of a competitive, multi-party political system.
2)       Enforcement of the principles of the separation of powers between
the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government.
3)       Redistribution of power in favour of a more representative system
of government.
4)       Strengthening the independence of the judicial system, including
the Supreme Judicial Council and the Supreme Constitutional Court, to uphold the rights and freedoms of the people."

Significantly, he told me that he met with Assad personally for half an hour to discuss the document. Assad seemed
"nervous": and uneasy.
He did not express contrition, or speak of any kind of backward looking accountability or Commission of Inquiry process.
It is not clear what we should do with this, apart from knowing of it, but I wanted you to have it. I will be back in the
office tomw
(Monday) and can discuss at the margins of the morning meetings.

All best,

Harold how wonderful it was to meet with you and Sarah. I hope your talks went well.

I attach in the strictest confidence the statement agreed by the committee and Dr Bouthaina Shaabad, his political
advisor, and which the President seemed to agree.



Warm wishes from Exmoor and sorry not to be able to join you tomorrow.

Jeffrey
