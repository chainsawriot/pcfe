Subject: Israel suspends demolition of Palestinian homes (AP)


JERUSALEM - (AP) An Israeli defense official says the military is temporarily suspending its contentious
policy of demolishing illegally built Palestinian homes in the West Bank.
   The official says the head of the territory's military administration issued this order after determining the
policy is not equally enforced against illegally built Jewish settler homes.
  The Palestinians have bitterly complained that demolitions are arbitrary and lopsided and that it's difficult for
them to get Israeli construction permits.
  The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the order, which was issued in an internal
memorandum. He didn't say how long the order would last.
  A statement from the military administration says it's committed to equal enforcement.
