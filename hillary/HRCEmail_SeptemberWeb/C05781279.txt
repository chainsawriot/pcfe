Amy,

It appears the department never received the letter. The organization apparently posted it on change.org, and then
issued a press release that it had published the letter.

Attach you will find the letter that was posted to chang.org. It appears Counselor Mills asked NEA A/S Jeff Feltman to
make a recommendation on how to respond--will need this recommendation from NEA today on how the Department
should respond.

Thanks for your support.

Clarence

Subject: Letter to Sec Clinton

Dear Secretary Clinton,

On June 3 we wrote a letter asking you, our friend, to make a public statement supporting our right to drive. More than
20,000 Americans in all 50 states have expressed support for that call.

Many of us have met you personally during your decades-long journey as a champion of women's rights all over the
world, and we expected our call to be met with a warm, supportive response.

Unfortunately, that has not happened, and we write to express our deep concern over the US government's public silence
on the issue of Saudi women's right to drive.

Three days ago, on June 17, more Saudi women drove a car than ever before. But as we launch the largest women's
rights movement in Saudi history, where are you when we need you most? In the context of the Arab Spring and US
commitments to support women's rights, is this not something the United States' top diplomat would want to publicly
support?

We were encouraged to see public statements of support from more than half a dozen Congresswomen, including House
Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. But we believe that you personally making a public statement of support for Saudi Arabia
opening the country's roads to women would be a game changing moment.

Women remain barred from driving in Saudi Arabia, one of the strongest and longest standing US allies in the Middle
East. This has gone on for way too long and now, this week, we really need you to speak up about it.

God bless you.
Saudi Women for Driving (cL4.-1,--- c.)431--Ly.

                                                               #14

Saudi Women for Driving is a coalition of Saudi women's rights activists pulled together after the arrest of Manal al-Sharif,
a Saudi mother jailed for driving her car. We seek to use online campaigning to build international support for Saudi
women's right to drive. More than 100,000 people in all 50 states have joined Saudi Women for Driving campaigns over
the last month.
