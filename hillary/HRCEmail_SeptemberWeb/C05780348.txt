 NOTE FOR THE SECRETARY

 FROM:         S/SRAP — Ambassador Marc Grossman

 SUBJECT: Temporary Cuts to Japanese Assistance in Afghanistan

        Japan remains committed to its pledge of $5 billion over five years for
 Afghanistan (of which roughly $1.66 billion has already been disbursed), but it
 will reduce appropriations in the short term in order to free money for post-
 earthquake reconstruction.

        Japanese SRAP Ambassador Tadamichi Yamamoto called me on April 14 to
 report that a supplementary budget is likely to pass as early as the end of April which
 will include cuts in the already-adopted FY2012 budget. Total overseas development
 assistance will be cut by roughly 17% from its planned level of almost $7 billion. The
 $400 million budgeted for Afghanistan is likely to be cut by a larger percentage, but
 the lost funding will be restored in future budgets to meet the overall pledge. Specific
 cuts have not yet been identified, but Japan will prioritize sustained funding for ANP
 salaries, ANSF training and support, support to the Ministries of Defense and Interior
 and to provincial governors, and funding for ongoing projects. The remaining $100
 million of Japan's $1 billion Tokyo pledge for Pakistan is currently on hold pending a
 new IMF program, so it is unlikely to be delayed by short-term fiscal management.

         Foreign Minister Matsumoto may raise this with you in your meeting on
 Sunday. I recommend that you express gratitude for Japan's continued commitment
 to its pledge and also understanding for Japan's need to reduce its assistance budget in
 the short term. I also encourage you to mention your gratitude for Japan's tradition of
 assistance to both Afghanistan and Pakistan in your public remarks — our public
 recognition of Japan's role strengthens the Government's ability to defend foreign
 assistance in a difficult budgetary environment.

        The Government of Japan has informed the Government of Afghanistan and us
 of these likely cuts, but Yamamoto asked that we keep the substance of expected
 budget cuts private until the Diet finalizes the supplemental budget.
