        please pass my love and best wishes to secretary clinton - know this
        is like pushing a boulder uphill but also know that trying the
        impossible is what got northern ireland out of the mire of the past
        and she was and is part of that 'pushing all participants to be 'more
        than they think they can be'

        love and best wishes to her and to you and all involved

        inez
