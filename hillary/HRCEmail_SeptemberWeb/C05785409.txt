Subject: South African president Zuma arrives in Tripoli (Reuters)

TRIPOLI (Reuters) - South African President Jacob Zuma arrived in Tripoli on Monday for talks with Col.
Qadhafi, a meeting some hope could help find a solution to the violence in the country.

   Zuma walked down the red carpet at Tripoli's airport to meet assembled dignitaries to the sound of a band
and children chanting "We want Qadhafi!" in English, while waving Libyan flags and pictures of Qadhafi.
There was no sign of Qadhafi.

   Fighting broke out in February between forces loyal to Qadhafi and rebels, chiefly in the east of Libya,
seeking to depose him. NATO later intervened in the conflict under a U.N. mandate to protect civilians from
Qalhafi's forces.

  The U.N. Security Council voted in March to authorise a no-fly zone over Libya and "all necessary
measures" -- code for military action -- to protect civilians against Qadhafi's army.
