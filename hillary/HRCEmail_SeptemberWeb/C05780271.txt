Subject: Prosecutor orders Mubarak back from Red Sea resort (AP)


CAIRO (AP) - Egypt's top prosecutor has ordered deposed President Hosni Mubarak to be moved from a
hospital at a Red Sea resort to a military hospital for questioning about the deaths of protesters and allegations
of corruption and abuse of power.
   Prosecutor General Abdel Maguid Mahmoud did not name the hospital in Friday's announcement, but the
Armed Forces International Center, 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of Cairo, is known to be one of Egypt's best
hospitals. Reporters noticed an unusual number of guards there.
   Since his Feb. 11 ouster, Mubarak and members of his family have been under house arrest at their
compound in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. The 82-year-old Mubarak was taken to a hospital there for
unspecified heart problems on Tuesday, the day his questioning began.
