Subject: UN official says US breaks rules in torture probe (AP)



GENEVA (AP) - The United Nations' torture investigator says the United States is violating U.N. rules by
refusing him unfettered access to the Army private accused of passing classified documents to WikiLeaks.
   Juan Mendez, the U.N.'s special rapporteur for torture, says the U.S. Defense Department won't let him visit
Army Pfc. Bradley Manning without monitoring the conversation.
   Mendez said that condition "violates long-standing rules" the U.N. follows for visits to inmates globally.
   Manning was transferred to a Kansas military prison in April after being confined alone in a cell 23 hours a
day in a Marine Corps brig in Quantico, Virginia, for eight months after his arrest.
   Mendez said in a statement Tuesday he needs assurances Manning can be "absolutely candid" about his
treatment at Quantico.
