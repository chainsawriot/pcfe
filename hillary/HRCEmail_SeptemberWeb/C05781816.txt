Definitely. I have included a fuller version of the story in my Weekly Note to the Secretary which
should be coming up in the next hour or two. Bottom line is that WFP had 14 trucks delivering food
from its warehouses in Mogadishu to the IDP and refugee camps on the outskirts of Mogadishu. Eight
of the trucks successfully off-loaded and delivered their commodities, four of the trucks were
completely looted, and two of the trucks made it back to the warehouse unlooted. The Somali unit
in Nairobi has been in direct contact with the TFG to obtain it's version of events and have strongly
urged the leader of the TFG to make an urgent statement on the incident. We continue to seek
additional information and will send it forward, either through the SWO, or from the Somali unit in
Nairobi.
