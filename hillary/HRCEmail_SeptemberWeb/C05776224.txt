This was on the Friends of the ARC blog. Brzezinski is pushing this idea hard as well. I will have more of an update on
what is going on re a Palestine Pledge Fund and the ARC later this week. AM

Yesterday Bernard Avishai, adjunct professor at Hebrew University, author of The Hebrew Republic
<http://www.amazon.com/Hebrew-Republic-Secular-Democracy-Enterprise/dp/0151014523> , and a former editor of
the Harvard Business Review, argued in Taking Points Memo
<http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/10/07/bending_toward_justice/?ref=c3> :

"If President Obama is looking for a way to excite us with an American vision for a Palestinian state--one that can be
started on even before core issues are (entirely) resolved, and which implies what is plausible about peaceful integration
with Israel and Jordan--he could do worse than publicly get behind the RAND Corporation's ARC project.
<http://www.rand.org/palestine>"

Avishai acknowledges that the Arc leaves some contentious issues unresolved. "But," he challenges his readers, "I defy
you to watch this short video <http://www.rand.org/palestine > and think about the state the same way again."

We offer the same challenge to you. Watch the video <http://www.rand.org/palestine >, and see if it changes the way
you think about the possibility for a viable two-state solution. If it does, join FOTA <http://friendsofthearc.org/join-us/ >,
follow us on Facebook <http://www.facebook.com/#%21/pages/Friends-of-the-Arc/122002414477558> , spread the
word <http://friendsofthearc.org/spread-the-word/ > to friends, and help the video <http://www.rand.org/palestine >
go viral!
