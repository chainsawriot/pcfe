Subject: AU official says Gaddafi exit was discussed (Reuters)


TRIPOLI (Reuters) - An African Union official said on Monday the issue of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's
stepping down had been discussed during peace talks in Tripoli.

  "There was some discussion on this but I cannot report on this. It has to remain confidential," said Ramtane
Lamamra, AU Commissioner for Peace and Security. "It's up to the Libyan people to chose their leaders
democratically."

   He added the peace road map included an immediate ceasefire, promotion of national dialogue, protection of
foreign nationals in Libya and extention of humanitarian assistance.
