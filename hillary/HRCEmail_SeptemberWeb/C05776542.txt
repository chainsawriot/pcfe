Subject: Haiti urged to prosecute returned former strongman (AP)

PORT-AU-PRINCE (AP) - Human rights groups are urging Haiti to prosecute former dictator Jean-Claude
"Baby Doc" Duvalier following his surprise return to the country.
   Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch say Duvalier should be held accountable for the torture and
killing of civilians under his rule.
   Amnesty said in a statement January 17 rights violations were widespread during his 15 years in power.
   Duvalier abruptly returned to Haiti on January 16. He was forced from power following a popular uprising in
1986. His arrival comes as Haiti struggles with a political crisis, cholera epidemic and stalled earthquake
reconstruction.
   President Rene Preval said in 2007 that Duvalier would face justice if he returned.
