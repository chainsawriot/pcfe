CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt's former President Hosni Mubarak, who has been hospitalised since April and now
faces a trial, occasionally falls into coma but his condition is stable, a medical source said on
Sunday. "Mubarak's condition remains stable and he falls into coma occasionally so nothing is new in his
condition," a doctor in the hospital in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh told Reuters. He asked not to be
named. Earlier, Mubarak's lawyer said the former president had fallen into a coma.
