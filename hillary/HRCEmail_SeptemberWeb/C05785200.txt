Subject: Tunisia says may delay election on technicality (Reuters)

DEAUVILLE, France, May 27 (Reuters) - Tunisia could postpone its July election by a few weeks due to
technical issues, Prime Minister Beji Caid Sebsi said on Friday.

   Sebsi told a news conference at the Group of Eight summit in the northern French seaside town of Deauville
that the electoral commission could suggest a delay of a few weeks.

â€¢ "Maybe we need more time for elections that are beyond reproach," he said. The government has scheduled
a vote for July 24 but election officials have said it should take place on Oct. 16 to allow more time for
preparations.
