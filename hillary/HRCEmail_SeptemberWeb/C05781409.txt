Jake,

U/S Tauscher wanted me to let you and the Secretary know that she just completed the Ballistic Missile Defense
Agreement (BMDA), ad ref, with Romania. We will send full note when I learn further details. This is faster progress
than anticipated. The goal had been to complete before June NATO defense ministers meeting.

Wade
