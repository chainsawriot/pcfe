Dear Counselor Mills,

Thanks very much for your call earlier this evening. I've consulted with a few members of the board and wanted to run a
couple thoughts by you. First, we totally get the Secretary's discomfort with the image of her employees presenting her
with an award, especially one named after her. GLIFAA, however, is comprised of employees of all of the U.S. foreign
affairs agencies — not just State — as well as even foreign embassies. We have had a history of independence throughout
our nineteen years, often criticizing administrations for their lack of attention and even negative actions with regard to
LGBT issues. We are so excited to have an Administration and a Secretary who are such leaders on LGBT equality and on
the promotion and protection of the human rights of LGBT people. She has done so much on this front, and we want to
honor her for it. It will also help our group in raising awareness and relevance within the LGBT advocacy community and
the foreign affairs community.

I also forgot to mention that the invitations and department notice all went out mentioning the award.

This is all to say that we would very much like to present the Secretary with the award. We would drop the name,
however, and simply call it the GLIFAA Equality Award. Perhaps after she leaves office, we can consider renaming
it. Also, during the presentation of the award, we would emphasize that GLIFAA is an independent organization that is
comprised of many agencies and is not a bureau or any office of the Department presenting her with an award. We
have the same goal as you mentioned during our call: that it will be used to encourage personnel in any of the foreign
affairs agencies to change the way they operate and to be more forward-leaning on LGBT issues. Here is the write-up of
the award:

"The GLIFAA Equality Award is being awarded to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton for her extraordinary
leadership in the advancement of LGBT equality both at home and abroad. The award will hereafter be awarded on an
annual basis to honor an individual or group at any level of the U.S. Foreign Affairs Agencies for significantly advancing
LGBT equality through the creative and forward-leaning use of their offices."

Would the Secretary accept the award under these conditions? And, if so, would you object to us having Ellen record
her congratulatory video?

Thanks for your consideration.

Best,

Jon
