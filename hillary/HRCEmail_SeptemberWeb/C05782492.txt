 Subject: Palestinians to seek full UN membership September 23 (AP)



â€¢ RAMALLAH (AP) - The top Palestinian diplomat says the Palestinians will submit a bid for full membership at
  the U.N. Security Council September 23.
     Riad al-Malki's told reporters September 15 in the West Bank capital of Ramallah that the bid would be
  submitted September 23.
     His remarks appear to end the speculation over whether the Palestinians would risk a threatened U.S. veto of
  their statehood bid.
     The other option was to seek a lesser status as a non-member observer from the U.N. General Assembly,
  where the United States does not wield veto power.
