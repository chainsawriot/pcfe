  INFORMATION MEMO FOR THE COUNSELOR

  FROM:               E – Under Secretary Bob Hormats
                      S/GPI – Special Representative Kris Balderston

  SUBJECT:             Congressional Co-Chairs for Partners for a New Beginning
  (PNB)


  Background

  As you know, the Partners for New Beginning program is beginning to make
  progress in spurring private sector investment in targeted countries in the MENA
  region and the broader Muslim world. After a successful dinner with the Secretary
  earlier this week, we believe that the PNB Secretariat— chaired by the Aspen
  Institute and including leading figures from the private sector— is well positioned
  to foster significant investments that will make a tangible impact in these critical
  regions.

  As the PNB Secretariat has developed, there has been interest from the Hill in
  contributing to the program. To capitalize on this interest, the Aspen Institute has
  proposed to offer Honorary Co-Chairmanships to Senators Kerry and McCain.
  Both Senators are interested in working with the private sector to gain additional
  support for PNB. They are also willing to help secure support from the Gulf
  Sovereign wealth funds.
