 Subject: Vietnam announces new president (AP)

HANOI, Vietnam - (AP) Vietnam's lawmaking National Assembly has appointed Truong Tan Sang as the
communist country's new president. The announcement comes amid challenges at home with the economy and
abroad with China over disputed territory in the South China Sea.
  Sang, 62, received more than 97 percent of the vote as the sole candidate. He had most recently served as the
Communist Party's de facto No. 2 in charge of running day-to-day affairs.
  Monday's announcement was largely ceremonial since the position was already decided during the secretive
Party Congress in January.
  Sang nominated current Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung for a second term, expected to be announced
Tuesday.
