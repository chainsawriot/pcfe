Two troubling things yesterday:

First, a Chief of Mission vehicle with four chief of Mission personnel were detained by armed Government of Pakistan
Security forces at a checkpoint in Peshawar. After a two and half hour roadside detention the vehicle was released. US
reporters are apparently tweeting about it.

Second, the GOP apparently revoked permission for a plane to land with US-funded anti-terrorism assistance training
and equipment. It will return back to the states at considerable cost to the ATA program - perhaps upwards of $1
million.
