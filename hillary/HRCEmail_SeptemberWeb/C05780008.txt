GENEVA (Reuters) - Nearly 100,000 people have fled violence in Libya in the past week, streaming into
Tunisia and Egypt in a growing humanitarian crisis, the U.N. refugee agency said on Sunday.

   They include Tunisians, Egyptians, Libyans and third country nationals including Chinese and other Asians,
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said in a statement. About half of the 100,000 have gone
to Tunisia and half to Egypt.

    "We call upon the international community to respond quickly and generously to enable these governments
to cope with this humanitarian emergency," U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said.

  The Geneva-based UNHCR began an airlift of shelter and other relief supplies on Saturday night to Djerba,
Tunisia, and the aid will be brought to the Libyan border, it said.
