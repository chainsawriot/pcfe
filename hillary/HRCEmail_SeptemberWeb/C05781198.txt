Subject: Afghan officials say NATO killed 3 civilians (AP)



KABUL (AP) - Afghan officials say NATO forces battling insurgents along an eastern highway accidentally
killed three civilians who were caught in the crossfire. The dead included a woman who was a provincial health
official.
   NATO forces say locals presented the bodies of at least two civilians killed in the crossfire as they fought
with insurgents Thursday on a highway in Wardak province after a roadside bomb explosion. Spokesman Capt.
Justin Brockhoff says it was unclear whose fire had killed the civilians.
   But Afghan officials say it was clear the fire was from NATO forces.
   Wardak government spokesman Shahidullah Shahid says Dr. Ageela Helcmat and two of her family members
were killed in their vehicle. Ageela was the head of gynecology and maternal health for neighboring Ghazni
province.
