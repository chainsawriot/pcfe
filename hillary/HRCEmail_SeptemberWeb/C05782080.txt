STATEMENT BY SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON

Indictments by the Special Tribunal for Lebanon

The United States congratulates the Special Tribunal for its hard work on completing this important step. We understand that
this is an emotional and significant period for all involved and we call on all parties to promote calm and continue to respect
the Special Tribunal as it carries out its duties in a professional and apolitical manner.

The confirmation of the indictments by the pre-trial judge and their delivery by the Special Tribunal to the Lebanese
authorities is an important milestone toward justice and ending a period of impunity for political violence in Lebanon. We call
on the government of Lebanon to continue to meet its obligations under international law to support the Special Tribunal.

The Special Tribunal is an independent judicial entity, established by an agreement between the Lebanese Government and
the United Nations in response to a very difficult time in Lebanon's history. Its work is legitimate and necessary. It represents
a chance for Lebanon to move beyond its long history of political violence and to achieve the future of peace and stability that
the Lebanese people deserve. Those who oppose the Special Tribunal seek to create a false choice between justice and
stability. Lebanon, like any country, needs and deserves both.
