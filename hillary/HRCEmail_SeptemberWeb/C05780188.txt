In Miami Herald, in case you did not see:


GOP Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said she was pleased with the peaceful vote and
signaled future support for Haiti.
"If we have a better government — a clean government — the United States should remain fully engaged in helping the Haitian people
build up their economy," she told The Miami Herald's Editorial Board.
