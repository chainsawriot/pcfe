ADEN (Reuters) - Five Yemeni troops and a colonel and seven militants died overnight in clashes in southern
Yemen, and army artillery killed eight pro-government tribesmen by mistake, local and tribal officials said on
Saturday.
   The clashes took place outside Zinjibar, the center of the province of Abyan where militants have seized
several areas, a local official told Reuters. The region lies east of an international shipping lane where 3 million
barrels of oil pass daily.
   A tribal official said the army targeted the tribesmen which it mistook for militants as they approached
Zinjibar in another area late on Friday.
