Subject: Well done!

Dear Cheryl, Steve and Pat,

I just wanted to say congratulations on the enormously successful COM conference this week.

In the hallways and sessions, people were discussing the importance of being able to talk to their global colleagues and
interact directly with key players here in Washington. I know from my perch I got a lot of good work done.

As someone who has worked at USAID, NSC and State, and has watched the inability of smart people to do smart things,
I was impressed by not only the execution, but the vision to do it.

Smart idea. Smart people. Smartly executed.

Well done!

Farah
