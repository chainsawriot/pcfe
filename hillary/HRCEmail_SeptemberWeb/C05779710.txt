A text message claimed Wikileaks intercepted French Ambassador Didier Lebret's confidential message to his Foreign
Ministry claiming Manigat won with 50.12%. All 8 CEP members panicked and rushed to the CTV.

The purported confidential message claimed a turnout of 2.9 million, about 60% of voters. Turn out on March 20 was
around 22-25%. On that basis the rumor was most likely false.

Highlights:

- very late start today, with reduced staff.

- 1527 pres PVs quarantined in total
471 deputy PVs
546 senator PVs

- the rate of quarantine seems to be lower with the legislative PVs. This could be due to less fraud or more probably due
to more lax reviews during these last days.

- about 4000 PVs haven't been archived yet, being either under legal review, at the data entry phase, or in quality
control (most in the latter two).

                                                                                                                              1.4(B)

- CTV management officially announced at today's briefing that preliminary results will be announced April 4.

- 1507 presidential PVs were quarantined out of 11,182 in total. No updates on the legislative PVs.

- "only" 265 PVs were not received at the CTV out of the 25,000+. By comparison, in the first round, 3000 were missing.

- legislative PVs linked to fraudulent presidential PVs are being given extra scrutiny. The lawyers have a list of all
fraudulent presidential PVs that they can use to match legislative PVs to potential fraud. The lawyers have final
discretion over quarantine.

- there were between 8-10 lawyers on the day shift today.

- we continue to monitor the lawyer's work closely; inconsistencies in efficiency remain, but the reduction in PVs
pending review is noticeable and the quality of the review seems satisfactory overall.

- About 18 percent of reviewed presidential PVs had been quarantined as of yesterday.

Subject: Re: UV Update: 3/26

Finally, CTV Dir. Widmack Matador and Tech. Advisor Alain Gauthier held a Q&A.

With today's briefing, the increased # of attorneys, our and others' observations, and the fact that attorneys appear
assiduous in tracking fraud, the process appears to be on track. True observers can't vouch for consistency in their work,
but attorneys quarantined about 16% of PVs, which is a good sign. Despite some observed inconsistencies, the attorneys
appear to be doing a proper job.

Highlights:

Stats
• I5,200 PVs waiting for legal review;

• Overall about 10% of PVs show evidence of fraud;

.3411 presidential PVs reviewed - 550 quarantined, or about 16.1%;

•739 senatorial - 28 quarantined;

•673 C of Deputy - 59 quarantined;

•Current focus on presidential PVs - goal: review 600/shift, or 1,200 daily;

.3849 presidential PVs still to be reviewed; legislative PVs to be reviewed not yet determined;

•Types of fraud detected: unmatched CIN #; lower number of voters on Partial Electoral List (LEP) than actual votes cast;

•CTV management silent about criteria for database acceptance/rejection of PVs - they are "dynamic," but prefer not to
reveal to stay ahead of fraudsters; eg, Most PVs are well prepared, but fraud is not as obvious as 1st round
                                                                                                                                  1.4(B) ,
                                                                                                                                  1.4(D)
• Measures to improve production
- Increased # of lawyers, eg, 10 vs 6 last night, and 12 vs 6 today (March 26);                                                   B1

- Sort the PVs by category to improve handling.

•Observers' Concerns

- Constantly remind attorneys to apply review criteria consistently to maintain vote tally's integrity; use the partial list to
detect fraud in legislative PVs;

- Turn out:

      UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05779710 Date: 09/30/2015




- CTV will now brief observers daily @ I PM;

CTV's stated main objective: review as many PVs as possible to preserve the integrity of the electoral process.

'Our observations
- There appears to be a renewed sense of purpose to maintainthe deadline while ensuring consistent review;

- We shall keep abreast of review process, contact attorney supervisors, etc. to attempt to guage performance, etc.;

- In the next couple of days, we may have better sense of ability to maintain March 31 deadline.

Subject: CTV Update: 3/25

Today's highlights:

- CEP spokesperson held a press conference today at the CTV: no information unknown to us was presented, but it was a
positive step towards having more transparency for the public

- one possible concern given the current backlog is that results would not be ready by march 31, unless one of 2 things
happen:
1.the threshold is raised to reduce the number of PVs needing legal review
2. the legal unit's review capacity is increased. Given the lawyers are already working at high capacity, the only way to
do this is by having more lawyers.
We understand meetings were held at the CEP today to find ways of addressing this issue.

-we have observed differences in the quality and efficiency of the lawyers' review. Some are faster and more thorough
than others. Overall, all are getting tired and it is being noticed in their work.

CTV highlights:

+CTV received and catalogued all but 2-3% each of the three categories of PVs;

+CTV processed 34.19% of presidential; 24.02% of Senatorial; and 35.53% of Chamber od Deputies PVs;

+Opting for a higher rate of attorney examination of PVs, the remaining lot awaits review, causing a considerable backlog
of about 16,000 PVs (see CEP website under CTV, "Progres de la Tabulation for latest figures, as of 1536 hrs, local time);

+At current rate - attorneys process about 800 PVs daily - the attorneys must ramp up review to make March 31 deadline
for preliminary results;

                                                                                                                               1.4(B)
                                                                                                                               1.4(D)
                                                                                                                               B1




+We observed the attorneys thoroughly revewing PVs, taking about 5 minutes to review legislative PVs, typically without
the partial electoral lists, which are appended to the presidential PVs whose review take about 6-7 minutes, as the
attorneys check the national identification numbers using bar code scanners;

+In order to increase production, logically, the attorneys will have to spend less time on each PV, perhaps at the expense
of quality;

+We will watch closely whether attorneys maintain quality as they increase production;

- nearly all PVs have been received.

- the backlog of PVs continues at the legal unit. The PVs are reviewed by 6-8 lawyers per shift.

- the CTV will remain open 24hrs a day as long as needed to accommodate for the legal review process. CTV leadership is
monitoring this review closely. We, as well as other observers, also have been watching this process closely.

- we requested, with other observers, daily briefings to be held by CTV leadership, as stipulated in CTV procedures. The
first briefing is expected to occur tomorrow.

+Progress reports will be posted on the CEP web site, under VTC, every 6 hours;

+Note that CTV management does not intend to divulge the threshold used to accept/reject PVs;

+The higher rejection rate of a low threhshold has increased the attorneys' work load, though we observed what appeared
to be focused examination by the attorneys. Of course, thus, there is considerable backlog of PVs for attorney
examination.

Subject: CTV Update: 3/21

Here are the main updates for today:

          The CTV opened at 6am, but started processing PVs in'the early afternoon. Initial tests were run in the morning
          to adjust the threshold number of votes used for referring a PV to the legal unit. This adjustment was necessary
          because the initial threshold, based on first round turn-out, was too strict and quarantined 80% of the PVs. The
          new number was determined based on how many of the initially quarantined PVs were deemed valid by the
          legal unit after review. (Note: Observers have not been informed of the thresholds used.)
          Each department will have a threshold number that can be adjusted over time as more data becomes available
          on voter turn-out. This is in contrast to the first round when the threshold number was fixed and used for all
          departments. The database will automatically refer any PV to the legal control unit based on this threshold
          number.
          We were pleased with the diligence of the lawyers and the smoothness of the process thus far. In addition, OAS
          observers and CTV staff indicated to us that the CTV was much more organized this round. Their impressions
          were that key deficiencies in the process had been addressed.
          Progress reports will be posted daily on the CEP website and daily briefings will be held with CTV leadership.

Best,
SK
