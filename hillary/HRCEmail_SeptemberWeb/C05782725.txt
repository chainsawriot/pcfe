 Hi Ron



 Long time. There is a possible compromise deal — Riad Malki is interested and wants to present it to Abu
 Mazen when he arrives in NY. It involves of course US diplomacy and finese for it to work. I think Bibi can
 go for it and it will be delivered to him tomorrow — here's the deal

1. Pals don't go to Security Council, or agree to freeze SC move for 1 year

2. UNGA resolution on upgrade — to something like the Vatican

3. The UN resolution includes a call to return to immediate direct negotiations



Bibi loves the principle of reciprocity so:



1. The Pals freeze all legal actions and boycotts against Israel during the negotiations (for up to one year)

2. Israel freezes settlement building during the negotiations (for up to one year)



Quartet and /or US drawas up TOR for negotiations based on Obama parameters with the end game stated as
the goal: reaching an agreement on "two states for two peoples" "end of conflict and end of claims" on all
permanent status issues including: borders, security, refugees, Jerusalem, water, economic relations, etc.



The heart is of course the parallel freeze



As I said Riad Malki is interested. US backing and a push to Bibi could make it work. Miki Eitan is my man to
Bibi.
