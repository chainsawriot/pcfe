Subject: Yemen's Saleh calls on opposition to join dialogue (Reuters)


SANAA (Reuters) - Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh addressed thousands of supporters on Friday, calling
on the opposition demanding his immediate removal to engage in dialogue to preserve stability in the Arabian
Peninsula state.

   "We call on the opposition to consult their consciences and come to dialogue and reach an agreement for the
security and stability of the country," he said.

    "These crowds are a clear message to those inside and outside the country ... on constitutional legitimacy."
