They will only work if countries invite them. The Election Commission is very highly regarded and operates with much
autonomy. It is already working with several countries (Africa) and very positive about collaborating with us. The Chief
Commissioner is here next week (will confirm dates) and this can be the main agenda item for discussion. I think if
presented well they would consider it very seriously. Happy to discuss further.

Just back - oh the 15 hour flights! Good trip.
Best,
Maria

Hillary:

I note that you are meeting with Foreign Secretary Rao tomorrow. I am on my way back from India, where I had a very
positive meeting with FS Rao and the Indian Election Commission about the prospects for increasing India's role in
elections globally and collaborating more closely in third countries. FS Rao is discussing this proposal with the Election
Commission, which is very interested in greater collaboration with American institutions. Bob Blake and I will be
following up with India's Chief Election Commissioner when he travels to Washington, DC next week. '

Best,
Maria
