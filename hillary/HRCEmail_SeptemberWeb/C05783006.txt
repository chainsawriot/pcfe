KAMPALA (Reuters) - Residents and rights groups said U.S. troops being sent to Uganda would give a fresh
impetus in the fight against Lord's Resistance Army rebels accused of murder and kidnapping children and
capturing their leader.

  The rebel group, which has waged a brutal insurgency for nearly 20 years, was ejected from northern
Uganda in 2005 and has since roamed remote jungle straddling the borders of Sudan, Democratic Republic of
Congo and Central African Republic.

   On Friday, President Barack Obama said he was sending about 100 troops to help and advise government
forces fighting the LRA


    Obama -- who has denounced the LRA as an "affront to human dignity" -- said the troops would serve as
trainers and advisers in the efforts to hunt down rebel leader Joseph Kony and would not be involved in combat
except in self-defence.

  "I think it is a good move because ... this will be a supplement to enforce the Ugandan UPDF (Uganda
People Defence Forces) to make sure that Kony is put totally down and he faces justice for the crimes he has
committed," Medie Sebuliba, a Kampala resident, said.

   The LRA is known for chilling violence including hacking body parts off victims, the abduction of young
boys to fight and young girls to be used as sex slaves.

   Attempts to negotiate peace failed in 2008 after Kony, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court,
refused to sign a deal to bring an end to the killing.

  The arrival of the U.S. troops could make a real difference, said Friar Benoit Kinalegu, a civil society worker
who follows LRA activity in Congo's northern province of Orientate.

   "The biggest problem is not the number of troops on the ground, the biggest problem is the co-ordination of
military intelligence," he told Reuters by telephone.

  The LRA are still launching sporadic attacks in Congo's semi-arid north, but with Kony rumoured to be in
CAR and the Congolese troops receiving training from the U.S. military, the situation is improving, he said.

   Although the group is thought to number just a few hundred, its mobility and the difficulties of the terrain
have made them difficult to tackle.

   Kinalegu says he is hopeful that more engagement from the United States and better planning could bring an
end to the LRA threat.

    "It's been a wish of mine for a long time," he added.

   Kony is from the Acholi ethnic group, which has borne the brunt of the LRA insurgency and welcomed the
U.S. move.

   "We the people of Acholi who have been the victims of this war, we have clearly stated that we don't
condone impunity, we don't support activities of rebellion by Kony," chairwoman of the Acholi Parliamentary
Group Beatrice Atim, told Reuters.
