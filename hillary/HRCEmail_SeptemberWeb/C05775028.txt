Yes. You'll have it on plane. The aim of the speech is to break NO new ground.

I've been trying to get a copy of the speech. I'm pretty confident he won't be breaking any new ground in the direction
of principles.

Subject: Jim Jones speech â€¢

Both Bruce Jentleson, my star staffer on the Middle East. and I had the same reaction at the sudden news that Jim Jones
will be giving a major keynote address at the Washington Institute Gala tomorrow night -- that he could be taking the
opportunity to lean further forward on declaring principles. I already raised this w/ Jake, but unless you are already in
the loop I think it might be worth your calling Jones just to ask what he is planning to say. Depending what he says it
could change the frame for us in May. AM
