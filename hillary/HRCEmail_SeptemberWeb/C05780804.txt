 Subject: Update -- Kyl Hold on Burns
 Importance: High

â€¢ Thanks to Jim Timbie's expert hand - and pending our ability to memorialize in writing a portion of the
  briefing we just concluded with Kyl staffer Tim Morrison - we have been informed that Senator Kyl is
  prepared to lift his hold on Bill's nomination.

 Tim also tells me that Kyl is the last hold left on Bill (and I suspect he would know).

 I have already been in touch with Reid's floor staff. The Senate will be in late tonight and apparently over
 the weekend. They know we're eager to move.

  Bill, please be on the look out for the text Jim is going to circulate shortly. I suspect we'll need a fast
  clearance from several folks.

  Thanks.
