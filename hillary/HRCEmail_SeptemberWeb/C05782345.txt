Subject: RE: Clinton Eulogy for Warren Christopher

Dan, I'm delighted,   as, I'm sure, is the family, that HRC will both attend and speak. Chris, before he died,
asked that A.B. Culvahouse (the senior partner of Chris's law firm) and I also give eulogies.
  I'm attaching the current draft of what I plan to say. I'm happy to amend it to accommodate what HRC wants
to say. I'll send you a copy of A.B.'s draft eulogy when I get it.
  I'm sure it would be fitting and moving if she were to reflect a bit on her own interaction with him in
connection with issues she worked on during the first term—just to take two examples: the women's summit in
Beijing and her trip to South Asia. Also, I think she'd be the ideal person to make that point that she and
President Clinton relied on Chris for advice on a whole range of issues, far exceeding the bounds of foreign
policy—including personnel issues, going back to the selection of Gore as running mate and the transition
process in which she and he were so much involved in Little Rock.
  I'm adding Madeleine Albright to this e-mail, since she'll be accompanying the Secretary to LA and, of
course, worked closely with Chris herself. Let me know if there's more that I can do.
  Regards, Strobe

        Strobe, I'm sorry to be coming back to you for help with another eulogy.., this is becoming a sad
        routine. HRC is planning to speak at Warren Christopher's service next week in California. If you have
        any thoughts on what she might say, we'd definitely appreciate it.

           Many thanks
           Dan
