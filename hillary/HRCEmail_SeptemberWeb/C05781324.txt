Dear Hillary
I was just waiting until you got home from the longest most amazing trip to thank you for what you did on PNB. It was
perfect in Turkey and Indonesia.
 What a boost for the whole initiative.
 I also just heard that you acceptedthe invitation to NDI. Cannot thank you enough. We are so proud of whatNDI is
doing and having you there is the best news

Meanwhile we have forgotten how to make things work in DC. Your statement on the mess here was also great.
So welcome home and look forward to catching. Our friendship is unique.
Love
Madeleinei

Madeleine--

I hope you heard about the great mtg I had w the Turkish PNB chapter. They were enthusiastic and excited about their
potential. I mentioned them in my press appearances and to Turkish leaders.

And in Indonesia I was able to say that they would have a PNB chapter too.

So, the word is spreading!
Thank you for your leadership and friendship which mean the world to me! Happy Summer--H

Dear Hillary
Another important trip. I know you have a ton on your mind and a big agenda in Turkey. Nevertheless, if you have a
chance to mention PNB in your meetings or to the press it would be a great boost. You may remember at the dinner you
hosted, the Turkish local chapter was really on its way. The head of it is Rifat Hisarciklioglu,President of TOBB (business
