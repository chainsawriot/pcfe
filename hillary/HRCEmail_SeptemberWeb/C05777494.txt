SANTA FE (AP) - Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson has been named a special envoy to the
Organization of American States. OAS Secretary General Jose Miguel Insulza announced Richardson's
appointment on January 11 in Washington, D.C. after a meeting between the two. The secretary general said in
a statement that Richardson's missions as a goodwill ambassador will be decided in the next few weeks but the
former governor will focus on immigration and economic development. Richardson served as U.N. ambassador
and energy secretary under former President Bill Clinton.
