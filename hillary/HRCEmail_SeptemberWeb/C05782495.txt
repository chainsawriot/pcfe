What should the White House do? Panic!

(CNN) -- People often ask me what advice I would give the White House about various things. Today I was
mulling over election results from New York and Nevada while thinking about that very question. What should
the White House do now? One word came to mind: Panic.

We are far past sending out talking points. Do not attempt to dumb it down. We cannot stand any more
explanations. Have you talked to any Democratic senators lately? I have. It's pretty damn clear they are not
happy campers.

This is what I would say to President Barack Obama: The time has come to demand a plan of action that
requires a complete change from the direction you are headed.

I don't know how else to break this down. Simply put:

1. Fire somebody. No -- fire a lot of people. This may be news to you but this is not going well. For precedent,
see Russian Army 64th division at Stalingrad. There were enough deaths at Stalingrad to make the entire tea
party collectively orgasm.

 Mr. President, your hinge of fate must turn. Bill Clinton fired many people in 1994 and took a lot of heat for it.
 Reagan fired most of his campaign staff in 1980. Republicans historically fired their own speaker, Newt

Gingrich. Bush fired Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. For God's sake, why are we still looking at the same
political and economic advisers that got us into this mess? It's not working.

Furthermore, it's not going to work with the same team, the same strategy and the same excuses. I know
economic analysts are smart -- some work 17-hour days. It's time to show them the exit. Wake up -- show us
you are doing something.

2.Indict people. There are certain people in American finance who haven't been held responsible for utterly
ruining the economic fabric of our country. Demand from the attorney general a clear status of the state of
investigation concerning these extraordinary injustices imposed upon the American people. I know Attorney
General Eric Holder is a close friend of yours, but if his explanations aren't good, fire him too. Demand answers
to why no one has been indicted.

Mr. President, people are livid. Tell people that you, too, are angry and sickened by the irresponsible actions on
Wall Street that caused so much suffering. Do not accept excuses. Demand action now.

3. Make a case like a Democrat. While we are going along with the Republican austerity garbage, who is
making the case against it? It's not the Democrats!

We are allowing the over-educated, over-explanatory bureaucrat by the name of (Congresssional Budget Office
director Douglas) Elmendorf do all the talking. Do not let him make your case. Let us make your case. Is it any
wonder that we were doing better in the middle of the stimulus-spending period than we are doing with the
austerity program?

4. Hold fast to an explanation. Stick to your rationale for what has happened and what is going to happen
under your leadership. You must carry this through until the election (never say that things are improving
because evidently they are not).

As I watch the Republican debates, I realize that we are on the brink of a crazy person running our nation. I sit
in front of the television and shudder at the thought of one of these creationism-loving, global-warming-
denying, immigration-bashing, Social-Security-cutting, clean-air-hating, mortality-fascinated, Wall-Street-
protecting Republicans running my country.

The course we are on is not working. The hour is late, and the need is great. Fire. Indict. Fight.
