Senator Isakson was incredibly helpful to the Department and USAID yesterday, not only pressing for Wendy Sherman's
nomination to move out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee but also in getting Mara Rudman confirmed by the
larger Senate.

Any chance we could ask S to write Senator Isakson a quick note thanking him for all his efforts and support? He has
been incredibly helpful on a host of things, and we increasingly need him on a number of our priorities. And the
relationship is genuinely a good one, as evidenced by the exchange they had last week when they bumped into each
other in the Capitol.

Thanks for considering.
