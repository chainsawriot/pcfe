Subject: Turkey to freeze EU ties if Cyprus gets EU presidency (Reuters)

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Besir Atalay said EU-candidate Turkey would freeze
relations with the European Union if Cyprus is given the rotating EU presidency in 2012, state-run Anatolian
news agency reported late on Saturday.

   "If the peace negotiations there (Cyprus) are not conclusive, and the EU gives its rotating presidency to
southern Cyprus, the real crisis will be between Turkey and the EU," Anatolian quoted Atalay as telling Turkish
Cypriot Bayrak Radio and TV at the end of a trip to the breakaway state of northern Cyprus.

  "Because we will then freeze our relations with the EU. We have made this announcement, as a government
we have made this decision," the agency quoted Atalay as saying.

   The internationally-recognised Greek Cypriot government is due to obtain the six-month rotating EU
presidency in July 2012.
