Subject: Officials: Israeli army raids West Bank theater (AP)



JENIN (AP) - Palestinian officials say Israeli troops have raided a West Bank theater overnight and arrested two
men involved in running it.
  The Freedom Theater in Jenin was founded by Juliano Mer-Khamis, an Israeli actor who had a Jewish mother
and a Muslim father and who was murdered in April.
  The killer has not been apprehended. It's unclear whether the raid was linked to the case.
  Palestinian security officials in Jenin say the theater's director and a member of the board were arrested.
  The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.
  Wednesday's raid left broken windows in one of the theater's two adjacent buildings. The Israeli military
denied the theater was targeted but offered no further details.
