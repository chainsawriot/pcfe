Subject: Hurricane Irene

Dear Cheryl,

We've had two beautiful sunny days here on the East End of Long Island, but Bill and I've been watching the Weather
Channel and we're worried
about the next four days because of the path of the hurricane.

The storm is supposed to hit all along the East Coast over Sat-Sun. This house is on the beach facing South so it is
particularly vulnerable. We may lose electricity and won't be able to leave.
