Hi Jake,

Breaking news: California Rep. Pete Stark will step aside to let Sander Levin take the Ways and Means chairmanship,
senior Democratic aides tell POLITICO.

Pls pass to S.




This makes it even more important that she raise the Guatemala labor issue with the FM when she sees him since Sandy
raised directly with me and was angry that it had not been pursued strongly enough by State and USTR in the past.




 Sandy will be THE key guy for any trade legislation we want to get through.

Thanks,

Bob
