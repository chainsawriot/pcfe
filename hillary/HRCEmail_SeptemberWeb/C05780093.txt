Subject: ELECTIONS UPDATE 0930 EST

    •    While most polling stations are open, there are preliminary reports that some polls in Port-au-Prince have not
         opened, mostly in West Department and Martelly areas. Post reports that the lack of voting materials is most
         likely the reason for these polling stations not opening on time. MINUSTAH is working to resolve now.
    •    Wyclef Jean was shot in the hand last night, and was subsequently released from the hospital. The exact
         circumstances in which the attack happened remains unclear.
    •    Edmond Mulet released the following statement according to the press: "This is the first time in Haitian history
         that we have a second round of an election. I therefore believe that the outcome of this election will be
         legitimate and will be supported by the majority of the Haitian people. By itself, it will already be an asset for the
         next Government."
    •    We have a conference call with post at 10:00, and will send another update thereafter.
