Subject:                        Greetings from the "outside"




I do hope you are well. You have been much in my thoughts as I have followed your travels and wondered how
you are doing amidst all the budget craziness. I hope I am not being too paranoid in being concerned about the
fact that DoS is being lumped together with DoD, DHS etc as a "security" department, subject to automatic
reductions if there is another stalemate. I know we all believe strongly that our diplomatic efforts are essential
for our national security but I worry that under the new scenario we will be hit harder than the other
departments.
