advocacy and human rights organizations. The Department and Embassy Phnom Penh have repeatedly urged Cambodia
to reassess the necessity of such a law and to enter into serious consultations with local NGOs and other

Ministry of Interior, after consulting with Prime Minister Hun Sen, forwarded the draft to the Council of Ministers (CoM)
for its review. Once approved, the law would move to debate in the legislature, where we expect it to be quickly
approved with no changes. While there is no fixed timetable for CoM consideration of the law, the process could move
quickly. We are coordinating our strategy and messaging with the EU, UN, UK, Canadian, and German missions in
Phnom Penh.
