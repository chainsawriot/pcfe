Latest on Bill Richardson from WHA:

He was called in to see Dagoberto at the MFA at 5pm. Josefina was also there. He was given/read a note that
said they did not appreciate his public comments describing AG as a hostage, and that was why he was not
going to be able to see Gross. It also said that he had no further role to play. Exact language unclear here, but it
sounds like it fell short of asking him to leave. In any case he said he plans to stay, and will undoubtedly try to
follow up w/the Cardinal tomorrow.
