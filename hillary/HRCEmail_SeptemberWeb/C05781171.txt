SEOUL (Reuters) - A high-ranking North Korean diplomat plans to visit New York later this week for talks
with United States officials, South Korean news agency Yonhap reported on Sunday.

   North Korea's First Vice Minister Kim Kye-gwan intends to meet Stephen Bosworth, the chief U.S. envoy
on Korean affairs, Yonhap said, quoting unidentified "multiple diplomatic sources".

    What would be a rare visit to the U.S. by a top Pyongyang diplomat is expected around July 28.

   Kim's visit would come a week after a surprise meeting on Friday between the two Koreas' top nuclear
envoys on the sidelines of a key Asian regional security forum in Indonesia, and the next day's brief encounter
between the two Korean foreign ministers.

   The contacts were interpreted as hinting at a progress towards unblocking the deadlock in inter-Korean
relations.
