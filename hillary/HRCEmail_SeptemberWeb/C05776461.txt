I fully agree that violence is a wild card we cannot predict, and it could greatly impact any of the scenarios. I suspect
Mulet's statement to the RNDDH to the effect that MINUSTAH would not provide logistical/security support for a second
round that includes Celestin is accurate.

This a great summary. I'd add two thoughts: first, its tough to predict the potential street reaction to all these scenarios,
and realistically the extent of the reaction will likely result in very different reactions by everyone involved; preval, mite, the
international community. This will be a real wild card moving forward. Second,                                  in a meetina          B1
before yesterday's core arouo meeting that
                                                                                                                                      1.4(D)
                                       Of course, he then didn't even hint at this at the core group meeting, so who knows
where minustah ends up.

Following are my views on likely election scenarios,
