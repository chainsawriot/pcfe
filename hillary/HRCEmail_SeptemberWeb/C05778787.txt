EXCLUSIVE: Former senator Chris Dodd is in negotiations to be named president of the Motion Picture Association of
America, the most sought-after and lucrative lobbying job currently open in Washington, according to a top industry
official. "It's not a done deal, but he's the only one in negotiations," the official said. The deal could take several weeks
to complete, the official said. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and former Senate Banking Committee chairman, did not
seek reelection in November. He has been mentioned for months as a possible head for the MPAA, which represents the
giant Hollywood studios. Several other top candidates, including former senator Bob Kerrey and former congressman
Tom Davis, wound up not making deals. Dan Glickman, who succeeded 38-year president Jack Valenti in 2004, left in
January 2010. Bob PisanÂ° is interim CEO and President.
