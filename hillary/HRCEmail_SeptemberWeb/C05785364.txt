Subject: Syrian activists

Feltman is proposing that you do a short meeting with human rights types who deal with Syria (some Syrian; some non-
Syrian). He thinks (a) it would be informative and (b) it would be a good signal. He suggest asap- like tomorrow am or
Monday.

I agree it's a good idea. Thoughts?
