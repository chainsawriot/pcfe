FYI I am forwarding you a message I iust sent to Rai about the article in today's Washington Post




He and I agreed to work closely on this issue. I have asked INR to get us some research on the security issue which the
implementing partners frequently raise                                                        Note the comment in the
Post about the security situation.

As you know we are moving forward on the broader branding issue and plan to have a team of experts advise us as we
move forward.




I will keep you posted.

Raj:




Hope the trip went well. You may have already seen the attached article but in light of our recent conversations I
wanted to forward it on to you.




Please know that I will help you in any way I can to deal with this situation.




Look forward to discussing it further when you return.
