PORT-AU-PRINCE (AP) - The businessman nominated to be Haiti's next prime minister wants to scrap the
earthquake reconstruction commission co-chaired by former U.S. President Bill Clinton. Daniel-Gerard
Rouzier says the 27-member commission is "dysfunctional" and has failed to accomplish much reconstruction.
Rouzier said he would replace the commission with a government agency. The commission was established
after the January 2010 earthquake because international donors wanted assurances that reconstruction would be
orderly and free of the corruption that has long plagued Haiti. But it has been criticized for its slow progress.
