Subject: Netanyahu vows to work with Obama to renew peace talks (Reuters)


WASHINGTON, May 22 (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged on Sunday to work
alongside U.S. President Barak Obama for a way to renew frozen peace talks with the Palestinians.

   Responding to Obama's efforts to ease tensions with Israel in a speech to a pro-Israel lobby group, over
policies on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict which the U.S. leader presented last week, Netanyahu issued a
statement saying:

   "I am a partner to President Obama's wish to promote peace and I appreciate his efforts in the past and
present to achieve this goal. I am determined to work with Presdient Obama to find ways to renew peace talks."
