Subject: American journalists and Curt Wheidon

Former Congressman Curt Wheldon who recently visited Libya called me to say that he and Congressman Galegly of
HFAC (vice Chair) were on a conference call with Saadi Qadhafi, son of the leader. Wheldon said he was maintaining
contact with Saadi to try to get the 4 journalists released and to get
                 out of the country. Saadi was very positive that the journalists would be released very soon. He was
taking a personal interest in seeing that Ms. Gillis had her own laptop and was going to be moved to a hotel. He
acknowledged he is up against hardliners (including Saif el-islam) who are arguing what will they get if the journalists are
released. Saadi promised to call Wheldon back in a few hours hopefully with good news.

Wheldon told me he and Galegly are willing to travel again to Tripoli to give the firm message to Qadhafi if the
administration believes that would be useful.

Subject: Clare Gillis call to parents, April 26

All,

I received a call from The Atlantic today, and they forwarded me the below message from Clare Gillis's
parents. Clare Gillis was able to call her parents again this morning; below is the mother's direct
readout. The parents are not going public with this information, but felt it should be shared with people at
the Department.




The Atlantic will be running a story on Clare, to keep the pressure on for her release. The parents will not raise
the issue unless asked by the press; they will only focus on the fact that Clare has called again.


Samantha
