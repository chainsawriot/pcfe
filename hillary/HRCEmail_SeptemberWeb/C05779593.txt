The Embassy is drawing from the 04/01 POTUS statement on the attack on the UNAMA compound in Mazar-
e-Sharif. The Embassy highlights positive statements from President Karzai and the Organization of the
Islamic Conference (01C). Please see below for the Karzai and OIC statements.



   President Karzai Condoles with UN Secretary General over the killing of UN Staff in Mazar-e-Sharif
Arg, Kabul H.E. Hamid Karzai, President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan spoke this morning on phone
with UN Secretary General, Ban Ki moon to convey his grief over the attack on Friday on the UN Assistance
Mission Office in Mazar-e-Sharif in which seven of his staff were killed.
The President asked the Secretary General to convey the grief and the sadness of the people and the government
of Afghanistan to the mourning families of the victims.
President Karzai described as ruthless the yesterdays violent attack and affirmed that the government of
Afghanistan is committed to launching an all-out probe into the incident and bringing to justice those responsible.
Stressing the importance of promoting a peaceful co-existence and harmony among the religions, President
Karzai asked the Secretary General to play his role in raising public awareness on the significance of resorting
to non-violence and non-desecration of faith and dialogue among religions particularly in countries where such
sacrilegious practices were carried out.


                                      OIC Secretary General condemns the killing of UN Staff
members during protests in Mazar-i- Sharif..

The Secretary General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference Prof Dr. Ihsanoglu today joined the
international community in condemning the loss of innocent lives during protests in Mazar-i- Sharif
(Afghanistan) against the burning of the Holy Quran in the US last month. The Secretary General expressed
particular condemnation at the killing of UN Staff Members during the incident. He emphasized the importance
of ensuring security for the staff and personnel of International Organizations who put their lives at risk in
implementing the mandates entrusted by the International community in the interest of global peace, security
and stability. In a letter addressed to the UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, Professor Ihsanoglu extended
condolences to the bereaved families of the UN Staff killed in the incident.

Recalling his warning against unforeseen and volatile consequences of the outrageous and irresponsible act of
burning the Holy Quran, Prof. Ihsailoglu reiterated OIC's position on a normative approach to deal with the acts
of discrimination and incitement to violence on religious grounds - through concerted efforts by the
international community- with a view to avoiding recurrence of incidents caused by inflamed religious
sentiments.
