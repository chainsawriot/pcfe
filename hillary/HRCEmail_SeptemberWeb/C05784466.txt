It really is quite shocking. Here is the question and answer:

â€¢Question: (Korean) I would like to ask President Carter. When you were in the White House, you had raised
the human rights of then-President Park, Jung-hee as an issue. Did you mention human rights issues to North
Koreans this time?

oPresident Carter: Well there are human rights issues that relate to the policies of the North Korean
Government, which I don't think that any of us on the outside can change. But one of the most important
human rights is to have food to eat. And for the South Koreans, and for the Americans and others to
deliberately withhold food aidl to the North Korean people because of political or military issues not related
really is a human rights violation. Obviously, if we had will to impose an American or South Korean form of
government on the North Korean people that might be our preference, but that is something that is outside the
control of anyone other those who live in and govern North Korea.
