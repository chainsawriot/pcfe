Subject: Three Saudi Shi'ites released after rare protest (Reuters)


AWWAMIYA, Saudi Arabia, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Three Shi'ites held in prison for over a year were freed in
Saudi Arabia's oil-producing Eastern province, a Shi'ite preacher and a local journalist said on Sunday, days
after a rare protest demanding their release.

  Shi'ites staged a small protest on Thursday in the town of Avvvvamiya, near the Shi'ite centre of Qatif on the
Gulf coast, to demand the release of the three; who had been held without charges.

  "They were released today," preacher Khoder Awwami told Reuters on the sidelines of a ceremony in a
small mosque where the three were welcomed.

    "I am so happy," said Muneer al-Jasas, a blogger and one of the released men.

    Officials could not be immediately reached for comment.
