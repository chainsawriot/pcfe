Subject: Jordan police questions 70 Muslim militants

 AMMAN, Jordan - (AP) A police official says 70 Islamic hardliners have been arrested for suspected armed
attacks that left 83 policemen wounded.
   The official says the men from the ultraconservative Salafi trend of Islamic were involved in Friday's clashes
in the eastern city of Zarqa, where they stabbed unarmed policemen with swords and brandished bundles of
barbed wire.
   The official said Saturday among those arrested was senior Salafi figure Abed Shihadeh al-Tahawi, who
served a jail term recently for plotting terror attacks against the U.S. and Israeli embassies.
   The ultraconservative Islamic sect is banned in Jordan and follows the tenets of Islam widespread in
neighboring Saudi Arabia.
   The official insisted on anonymity because comment is banned on an ongoing investigation.
