Subject: Libyan intelligence chief denies defection rumors (AP)


TRIPOLI (AP) - Libya's chief of intelligence is knocking down rumors that he is among the government
insiders who have abandoned their embattled leader, Moammar Gadhafi.
   Libyan state TV aired a phone interview with the official, Bouzeid Dorda, who denied that he defected and
said he will not "betray the people or the leader."
   He said he never thought to the leave the country and will remain steadfast with Gadhafi "despite
everything."
   Two members of Gadhafi's inner circle, including his foreign minister, have abandoned him in recent days as
international airstrikes against Libya continued. While fighting between government and rebel forces appears to
be drifting toward stalemate, coalition diplomatic efforts are focused on breaking Gadhafi's hold on power.
