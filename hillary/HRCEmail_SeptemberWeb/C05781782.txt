Subject: Turkey calls for Islamic meeting on Africa famine (Reuters)


ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey has called for the 57-nation Organisation of the Islamic Conference to hold an
emergency meeting on the famine in Somalia and the risks that poses to other African countries, Foreign
Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said on Friday.

   "It doesn't matter whether the meeting is held in Istanbul or Jeddah, we want OIC to step in as soon as
possible. We want to meet the needs of our African brothers in Ramadan month," he told reporters in Ankara
after Friday prayers

    Davutoglu said he had made the request on Thursday to OIC Secretary-General Elcmeleddin Ihsanoglu, a
fellow Turk.

    He added that his ministry was organising a visit to Ethiopia and South Africa later this month.

   "We may add other countries including Kenya in light of recent developments. We are planning the visit to
take place after Aug. 15, maybe around Aug. 20," Davutoglu said.

   Some 3.7 million Somalis are at risk of starvation, the majority of them in the south of the Horn of Africa
country that has been in a state of armed anarchy for two decades, complicating any humanitarian relief
effort.

   Hundreds of thousands have made the dangerous trek to the capital Mogadishu and its outlying areas in
search of food aid.

   On Friday, a Somali soldier was killed and a dozen residents wounded when three trucks loaded with food
intended for famine victims were looted in Mogadishu, witnesses said.
