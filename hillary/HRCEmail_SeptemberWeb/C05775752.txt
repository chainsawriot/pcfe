MS -

We're hoping you'll be ok with taking one of the videos you were going to record tomorrow - the one for the Pakistani
audience - and instead deliver the remarks live in the Treaty Room, one of those things where you just pop out the side
door, make a statement, vamanose back through the doors

You have the time in the morning, we'd be dropping a video, and it will have ten times the impact. And to sweeten the
deal...

We can scrub BOTH flood related videos and merge their remarks into one live Treaty Room Statement

Please let us know so we can make the necessary changes and preparations.

PIR
