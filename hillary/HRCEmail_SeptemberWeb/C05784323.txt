Subject: Sec Clinton's Statement

Megan, I thought Secretary Clinton's remarks on the drought and the related famine in Kenya were superb. I've heard
wonderful comments about the piece from Kenyans and fellow diplomats. Thanks for all you do to make America's
image shine brightly overseas. With sincere appreciation and continues best wishes, Scott
