    1.   (SBU) SUMMARY: President-elect Michel Martelly has organized a transition team focused on three areas:
         political, economic and social issues. He emphasized multiple times his interest in providing universal
         education to young Haitians. Martelly said his government seeks a strong and durable partnership with the
         United States, and thanked the U.S. for its support of an impartial political process. END SUMMARY.

    2.   (SBU) The Ambassador and Pol Chief met with President-elect Martelly on April 6, two days after preliminary
         results proclaimed him the victor by a large margin. Although the results are not considered final until April 15,
         Martelly's victory was sizable enough to dispel any lingering doubts regarding his status as President-elect. The

        Ambassador congratulated Martelly on his victory, and complimented him especially on the inclusive tone of
        his April 5 press conference. Martelly said he intended to make communication with the Haitian people a
        priority, and said he would use the bully pulpit of his position to change the law-ignoring reflexes of many in
        Haitian society. "Tail lights on cars will not be an accessory item," said Martelly.

   3.   (SBU) Martelly said he would focus on job creation, on the rule of law and on education. Regarding job
        creation, Martelly said he welcomed the advice of the United States, and said he wanted to change the image
        of Haiti so that misery and the earthquake damage were not the leading symbols of Haiti in the world. He said
        he would focus on development in the northern and southern regions of the country because of their potential,
        but also to reduce the pressures on the greater Port-au-Prince area.

   4.   (SBU) Regarding rule of law, Martelly said Haitians needed to change their mentality that laws were meant to
        be ignored. Paying and collecting taxes will be a requirement of all citizens, although Martelly said this would
        be accompanied by real investment by the Haitian government to show the impact of tax revenue. Martelly
        also dismissed his advisor's suggestion that he be immediately given an official vehicle. His administration
        would be clean, and those appointed in it would not be there for personal gain, Martelly vowed. He added that
        he supported the Constitutional amendments and would lobby for their passage.

   5.   (SBU) Martelly particularly focused on the importance of education in Haiti. He proudly described a pilot
        program already begun with private funds that would subsidize children in the north and south of Haiti who
        were not already attending schools. Martelly said he would finally implement the Haitian Constitution, which
        calls for the universal education of Haitian youth.

   6.   (SBU) COMMENT: Martelly and his team were clearly in a good mood, buoyed by their significant victory over
        Myrlande Manigat. They were grateful for U.S. support of the political process, and very interested in a strong
        partnership with the U.S. Although Martelly focused on education, he also agreed that development was
        impossible without significant investment, and he seemed particularly interested by our development
        programs in the north and in our electrification programs. Martelly's gifts of communication will come in
        handy in the ensuing months and years. He recognized that some of his proposals might cause his popularity to
        diminish, especially the ones reinstituting long-lapsed tax collection. However, in the excitement of this victory,
        these battles were in the future, and in the present, his team was excited and ready to work. END COMMENT.
