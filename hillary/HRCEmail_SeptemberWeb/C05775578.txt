Subject: Civil Society and Women at the Kabul Conference




UNAMA chief Staffan De Mistura and his deputy Martin Kobler said they brokered an agreement today between Afghan
NSA Spanta, Civil society reps and Sima Simar for the Kabul Conference. There will be one chair at the table and one
chair behind. The civil society rep will sit at the table ( the woman who was mentioned earlier (P...?); sorry I don't recall
right now; Kathy recognized her name). Sima Simar would sit behind. Eight minutes would be allow for speaking and
the civil society rep will begin. Please, however, Staffan and Martin asked that we please keep this compromise quiet so
it will hold. Staffan thanked us for our pushing the Afghan government in this direction by our quiet interventions over
the past few days.




Best,

Tony
