Subject: France eyes new military targets in Libya (Reuters)


PARIS (Reuters) - France is pushing for NATO approval to extend military strikes on Muammar Gaddafi's
army to strategic logistical targets, to try to break a deadlock in Libya's civil war as the civilian death toll
mounts.

   The push comes as France and Britain, which are leading the campaign in Libya, are struggling to get
coalition partners to step up their participation or contribute more hardware, despite pleas from rebels that
civilians are dying in the besieged city of Misrata.
