Subject:                           Lee Kwan Yew praise for WJC



I'm in Singapore for a forum on FutureChina and am listening to John Thornton interview to Lee Kwan Yew. Someone
from the audience asked him who the greatest leaders were that he had met in his career, and he answered Deng Xiao
Ping, Helmut Schmidt, and WJC. Nice company!

Congrats on the Mexican truck deal! And making sure the flo/flytilla didn't turn into a disaster.
