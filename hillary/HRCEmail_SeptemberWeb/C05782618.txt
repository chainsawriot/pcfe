Subject: Israel accepts Quartet call for peace talks (Reuters)



JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel accepted on Sunday a call by the Quartet of international peace mediators to
resume talks with the Palestinians, an official Israeli statement said.

    "Israel welcomes the Quartet call for direct negotiations between the parties without preconditions," the
statement issued by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said.

  "While Israel has some concerns, it will raise them at the appropriate time. Israel calls on the Palestinian
Authority to do the same and to enter into direct negotiations without delay," said the statement, released after
Netanyahu held consultations with senior cabinet ministers.
