With apologies for the delay (                                     ), here are a couple of key points with some cites to
back them up.

   1) When women get involved in protests it means families get involved — it begins to permeate the entire society.
      This was true in Egypt (http://www.bbc.co.ukinews/world-13056685) — now women are protesting in Yemen
      (with their men protecting them) and Syria
      (http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/14/world/middleeast/14syria.html?smid=tw-nytimes&seid=auto) . For a
      discussion of women across different countries in Arab Spring see
      http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/22/women-arab-spring?INTCMP=SRCH . (I have excerpted some of
      this piece below). Think also of the role of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo in Argentina — marching and
      marching until they got answers about their disappeared sons. Women who have lost husbands, brothers, and
      sons are often the collective memory of a society.

    2) Women are the majority users of the internet. http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/20/whv-women-rule-the -
       internet/ "Women are the routers and amplifiers of the social web." These are protests fired by a ever denser
       web of social and political connections, providing resilience (no clear leaders, so it's impossible to cut off the
       "head" of revolution," and making it extremely difficult to block information of what is happening. That web is
       the best hope of changing these societies for the longer term, and women are essential.

    3) What all of this should do for the observers the world over is reinforce the image of women as change agents,
       active players in shaping their society rather than as victims. They can march fully veiled; they can tweet and
       blog and post from inside compounds; they can lead through social networking just as well as through
       megaphones at the head of a crowd. And in turn, a U.S. foreign policy fully focused on educating and
       empowering women in the ways they want to be empowered is a progressive foreign policy that serves both our
       values and our interests.

From the earliest rumblings of discontent in Tunisia at the turn of the year, it was clear that old images of Arab
women as deferential, subservient and generally indoors would have to be revised. From the highly-educated
Tunisian female elite of doctors, barristers and university professors to the huge numbers of unemployed female
graduates, women were key players in the uprising that launched the Arab spring.

In Cairo, they were instrumental not just in protests but in much of the nitty-gritty organisation that turned
Tahrir Square from a moment into a movement. Women were involved in arranging food deliveries, blankets,
the stage and medical help. In Yemen, it was a young woman, Tawakul Karman, who first led demonstrations
on a university campus against the long rule of Ali Abdullah Saleh. Karman emerged as one of the leaders of a
revolution still yet to run its course.

In Bahrain, women were among the first wave that descended on Pearl Square in the capital — some with their
children — to demand change. And the Bahraini movement has latterly found a figurehead in Zainab al-

Khawaja, the woman who went on hunger strike in protest at the beating and arrest of her father, husband and
brother-in-law. "Women have played a hugely influential role this time and put themselves in danger," said
Nabeel Rajab, president of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights. "They treated the injured in the streets and
nursed them in their homes when they were too afraid to go to hospital."

In Libya, women were at the vanguard too, when mothers, sisters and widows of men killed in a prison
massacre in 1996 protested outside a courthouse in Benghazi after their lawyer was arrested
