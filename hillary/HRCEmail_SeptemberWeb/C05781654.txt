                     Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton
                     Statement on the Passing of Alice Pickering
                                  Washington, D.C.
                                    June 24, 2011


 I was deeply saddened by the passing of Alice Pickering, wife of former
 Ambassador Thomas Pickering. Like so many members of the extended State
 Department family, Alice was deeply devoted to America's ideals, our values, and
 the importance of service. For four decades, in posts ranging from Russia to El
 Salvador, she and Tom served the United States with great distinction.
 Tom once said of her, "Often I get the recognition, and she gets the tough jobs."
 But all of us who were lucky enough to know Alice understood her commitment
 and appreciated her love for her family and her country. At every post, she took
 special pride in nurturing the new Foreign Service staff and making sure their
 families felt at home.
 On behalf of President Obama and all the women and men of the State
 Department, I offer my deepest condolences to Tom; their children, Timothy and
 Margaret; and all their beloved family and friends.
