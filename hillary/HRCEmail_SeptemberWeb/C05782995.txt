Subject: Yemen: Al-Awlaki's son among dead in US airstrike (AP)



SANAA (AP) - Tribal elders say the son of slain U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlalci has been killed in a U.S.
missile strike along with six other al-Qaida militants, including the media chief of the terror group's Yemeni
branch.
   The elders in the southeastern province of Shabwa where the strike took place identified the son as 21-year-
old Abdul-Rahman al-Awlaki. There was no official confirmation of his death from Yemeni authorities.
   The elders, who spoke Saturday on condition of anonymity because they feared reprisals, had earlier said that
five of al-Awlaki's clan were among the seven people killed in the missile attack.
   The older al-Awlaki, a gifted Muslim preacher and savvy Internet operator who became a powerful al-Qaida
recruiting tool, was killed Sept. 30, also in a U.S. drone attack.
