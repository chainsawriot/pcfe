Hearing from Kent Conrad's staff that there will be a $4 billion cut to the overall 150 account...he is telling Committee
Democrats that 150 was increased $8 billion in the President's request, so this is only a 50% cut to our overall increase.
The Senate Budget Committee is slated to mark-up on April 21st, but won't go to the floor until the House passes its
budget. We have prepared call sheets for both of you to make calls to Conrad, Gregg and others.
