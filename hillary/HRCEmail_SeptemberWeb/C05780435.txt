Subject: Gaddafi forces surround Zlitan, threaten rape - rebels (Reuters)


BENGHAZI (Reuters) - Forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on Friday surrounded Zlitan, one of
only three towns separating the rebel-held city of Misrata from the capital Tripoli, a rebel military spokesman
said.

   "Large numbers of troops are surrounding Zlitan from all directions and are threatening its residents with
having their women raped by mercenaries if they do not surrender," Ahmed Bani, military spokesman, told
Reuters by phone from Benghazi.

   Zlitan could act as a stepping stone to allow the anti-Gaddafi uprising to spread from Misrata, the biggest
rebel outpost in western Libya, to Gaddafi's stronghold in Tripoli.

   Bani said the troops around Zlitan were equipped with artillery and Grad rockets. He said clashes broke out
in Zlitan on Thursday, and 22 rebels had been killed.
