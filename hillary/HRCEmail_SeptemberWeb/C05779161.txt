How do you advise we escalate this?

It will be a real public mess if this aborts

I just called the Egyptian Amb here. He wasn't very encouraging given the hour. (He was trying to be helpful, but was
pessismistic.). He said he'd call me back.

Jeff/Jake,

The air carriers from whom we have leased the evacuation aircraft put in the normal landing clearance requests to the
head of the Egyptian CM, name below. He has not granted landing clearance. Our push to begin the evacuation would
be aborted if this can't be fixed soon.

We are trying at all levels to get the landing clearances. Matt Tueller has tried but has not had any results so far.

M said that he would have to ask the Secretary to make a call if this can't get resolved quickly. He suggested you might â€¢
make a direct call to the Foreign Minister and if it would be useful, the Egyptian Ambassador.

Attached is the list of aircraft that are scheduled to arrive in Cairo tomorrow morning.

I am in Task Force at 647-6611.

Lee

Contact person:
Captain Sameh El Hefny
Head of Civil Aviation Authority
226-882-32 is the correct fax number
