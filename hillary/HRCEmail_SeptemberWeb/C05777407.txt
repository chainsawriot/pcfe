Sen. Graham and I were on the same flights back from Kabul last night.
We had a good chance to share our observations about Afghanistan and Pakistan.
More importantly he mentioned that he is seriously considering serving on the Senate Approriations Committee and as
the ranking minority member on the foreign operations subcommittee. He expressed strong support for Secretary
Clinton and said the main reason he wants to serve on Foreign Ops is to protect our budget requests against those who
will advocate for severe cuts. I thanked him for his committment and encouraged him to pursue this committee
assignment. He said this won't help him politically in South Carolina but these are the issues that matter most to him.

He said that he plans to call the Secretary soon to brief her on his Af-Pak trip and to offer suggestions on our policies
and funding programs there.

I think the Secretary should call him, today if possible, to encourage him to take the Foreign Ops assignment and to
help us protect our budget needs.

Mike
