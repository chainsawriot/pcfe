Tom:

Knowing the difficulty of getting messages to the Secretary, would you consider passing this along to
her. Love to VA and all.
A.




Dear Madam Secretary:

Please excuse the seeming informality of an email thank you note; however, I realize the difficulty of
getting mail into the State Department and I wanted you to know how appreciative I and the other
450+ attendees were of your remarks yesterday at the Economic Club of New York breakfast. We
hope we were able to provide you with the right venue to talk about Economic Statecraft and the
leadership role the United States must take to assure that our global economy returns to where it
needs to be.

I heard nothing but praise for your remarks (this coming from a naturally right-leaning group of
people). And I was especially pleased that you liked my introduction enough to consider continued
employment for your Deputy Secretary, Mr. Nides!

Please know that the Economic Club prides itself in being non-partisan and for providing a venue for
the dissemination of thoughts and ideas to improve the economic well-being of our city, state, country
and world. As such, we invite you and other members of the administration to use the Economic Club
to further benefit all of us.

Ann and I (and Sarah and Charlotte who became huge fans of yours at HP's and Lynn de
Rothschild's parties) send our best to you and all the Clintons, and we send our sincere thanks.

Andrew.
