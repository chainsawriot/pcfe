TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Muammar Gaddafi has accepted a roadmap for ending the conflict in Libya, South African
President Jacob Zuma said on Sunday after leading a delegation of African leaders at talks in Tripoli.

   "I have some commitment which is compelling me to leave now but we have completed our mission with the
brother leader (Gaddafi)," Zuma said after several hours of talks with the Libyan leader at his Bab al-Aziziyah
compound.

   "The brother leader delegation has accepted the roadmap as presented by us. We have to give ceasefire a
chance," he said, adding that the African delegation would now travel to the eastern city of Benghazi for talks
with anti-Gaddafi rebels.
