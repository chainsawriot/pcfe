Subject: KAJ did great

Kern-Ann hit our top-lines as scripted to kick off our presser at the Reagan building, then used our affirmative
messaging points to address the questions (which were along lines we predicted — see below). We are posting
the video on our website and pushing out the transcript. The meeting itself was orderly and uneventful, ending
about 15 minutes later than scheduled. Turnout was not that big considering all the press attention.

Issues Kern-Ann addressed in response to Qs:

      • Nebraska governor's letter/pipeline routing (Omaha World Herald)
      • FOIA emails (Al Jazeera)
      • How is input from public mtg weighed (Reuters)
      • What are the next steps in the process, (Japanese NHK)
      • Business groups vs enviro groups access (Mother Jones)
      • Weight of FEIS vs other national interest considerations (Dow Jones)
      • State's relationship with Cardno-Entrix (The Guardian)

We are now monitoring press reporting and will engage as needed to shapellorrect/fix. PBS is due to air the
segment today which includes KAJ's interview done in Nebraska and we'll have to see whether KAJ's push
back with NYT helped with the Cardno-Entrix piece they are working (which could run tomorrow).

KAJ/Caitlin — feel free to add/correct. KAJ endured a tough moot but we think it really paid off. Thanks to
Caitlin once again for her super human efforts on this all week. Go team!
