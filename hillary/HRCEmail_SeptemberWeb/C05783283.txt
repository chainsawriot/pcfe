UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas Friday gave U.N. Secretary-General
Ban Ki-moon an application for U.N. recognition of Palestinian statehood opposed by the United States and
Israel, a U.N. spokesman said. Abbas met Ban at United Nations headquarters to present the formal request to
the U.N. Security Council, which is expected to take time to consider it.
