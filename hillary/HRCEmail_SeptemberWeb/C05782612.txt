Subject: Arrest warrant issued for US soldier over rape (Yonhap)

A local court issued an arrest warrant Saturday for a U.S. soldier accused of raping a young Korean woman,
officials said.

The 21-year-old Army private, assigned to the 2nd U.S. Infantry Division in Dongducheon, was charged with
raping an 18-year-old woman near his unit at around 4 a.m. on Sept. 24.

The woman was watching television in her rented room in downtown Dongducheon, where several military
bases are located, according to South Korean investigators.

Police identified the soldier through a closed-circuit surveilance camera installed near the room and informed
the U.S. military of the case.

On Wednesday, the U.S. government apologized for the case and promised full cooperation with South Korean
police in the investigation. Washington's swift response reflects its desire to minimize any political and
diplomatic fallout.

In 2002, a wave of anti-American rallies erupted in South Korea after two schoolgirls were crushed to death by
an armored U.S. military vehicle. Around 28,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea.
