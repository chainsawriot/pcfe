Subject: Fresh clashes kill 12 in southern Yemeni city (Reuters)


ADEN, Sept 14 - Fighting between the Yemeni army and militants in and around a southern provincial capital
of Zinjibar killed 12 people on Wednesday, just days after the government declared it had "liberated" the city
from Islamist fighters.

   An army official said seven militants and one soldier were killed in a suburb of the coastal city of Zinjibar,
which the army last week recaptured from Islamist fighters suspected of links to al Qaeda's Yemen-based
branch. Four more militants were killed in another part of Zinjibar.

   "The militants sneaked into the area to try to carry out a suicide attack, but the snipers from the army
prevented them and killed seven extremists," said the military official.

    Residents said the army launched Katyusha rockets against pockets of insurgents in the city.
