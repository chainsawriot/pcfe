Subject: Quick Readout of Tom Adams Meetings in Brasilia

Wanted to provide a quick snapshot of Tom Adams' meetings with MRE and MOD today, including
meetings with U/S for Latin America Simoes, A/S for International Organizations Glivania Oliveira, and
MOD U/S for Policy Mendes. FYI - Simoes confirmed his participation in the September 19 meeting in
New York; Patriota is likely, but not yet definite.

Key points from today:

1.The press reports of a possible withdrawal of 250 Brazilian troops in 2012 appear to be
accurate. Brigadier General Mendes told us that if the UN agrees to include 250 Brazilian troops
among the overall reduction of 1,600 MINUSTAH forces, Brazil would bring home 250 troops in March
2012 as part of their regular troop rotation and not replace them.

2. All interlocutors were sensitive to the need to avoid a rapid and/or uncoordinated withdrawal of
MINUSTAH troops and reaffirmed Brazil's commitment to ensure that conditions in Haiti could sustain a
gradual drawdown.

3. All interlocutors also made clear the GOB's determination to develop an exit strategy, with a 5 - 7
year timeline. We responded that any drawdown had to be linked to a corresponding improvement
in the capacity of Haitian authorities to provide security and asked for Brazil to join us and others in
pressing the GOH to provide greater support to the HNP buildup and join us and other donors in
providing technical assistance in this regard.

4.MRE participants in the Montevideo conference reported discussion of trying to shift MINUSTAH
from a Chapter 7 operation to Chapter 6, but without any consensus. MRE told us that FM Patriota is

sympathetic to this notion, but emphasized that Brazil has not made a decision on whether they
would promote this idea.

5.None of our contacts pushed for expansion of MINUSTAH's mandate with respect to a
development component, but asked for USG support to retain last year's compromise language.

6.On mandate language, MRE discussed the need for better UN coordination between the
agencies. Tom requested language from them on this point to get a better sense of what they are
after on this issue.

We'll draft a cable, but wanted to get this out now.
