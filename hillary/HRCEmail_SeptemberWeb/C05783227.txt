dangerous weapons flows into and out of Libya.

o Assets that were previously frozen as a result of the UN sanctions will remain frozen until the Libyan
institutions are well-positioned to receive them.

for certain urgent needs.

• Eases restrictions on Libyan-operated aircraft flying abroad.

o Libyan-owned and -operated aircraft will now be able to make humanitarian, and other authorized
flights, thereby facilitating the resumption of additional air traffic, provided that the flights are
authorized through the existing NATO process.

o In light of continued fighting in some parts of Libya, member states and NATO will continue to be
authorized to use force to enforce the no-fly zone, protect civilians and enforce the arms embargo.

permit.
