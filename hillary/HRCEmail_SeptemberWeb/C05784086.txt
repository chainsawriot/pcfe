Subject: Russia's Medvedev says compromise possible in Libya (Reuters)


 HANOVER (Reuters) - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said on Tuesday that he believes compromise
between Libyan rebels and the government is still possible, and said supporting one side in the conflict is bad
for Libya.

  "We must continue the search for opportunities for a peaceful solution. ... We will continue the search for a
compromise. In my view it is achievable," Medvedev said at a joint news conference with German Chancellor
Angela Merkel.
