 ACTION MEMO FOR THE SECRETARY

 FROM:         SSRAP â€” Dan Feldman

 SUBJECT: Letter to Prime Minister Gilani on Diplomatic Immunity

 Recommendation

       That you approve the attached letter to Pakistani Prime Minister Gilani
 regarding diplomatic immunity.

        Approve                        Disapprove

 Background

        You called Prime Minister Gilani (acting Foreign Minister) on February 20
 to reinforce our request that he not go on record before parliament on Monday,
 February 21, with a statement that Raymond Davis has only "partial diplomatic
 immunity." During the call, Gilani claimed he was under tremendous pressure
 from religious extremists, and he did not confirm whether he would make a
 statement before parliament.

        Following up on your call, this letter further explains diplomatic immunity,
 including Raymond Davis's_ entitlement to full criminal immunity, and emphasizes
 that failure to act on this issue could sidetrack progress we have made in our
 bilateral relationship. This letter is intended to reach Prime Minister Gilani prior to
 his tentatively scheduled appearance before Pakistan's parliament on February 21.

 Attachment:
       Letter to Prime Minister Gilani
