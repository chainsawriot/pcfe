Subject: Egypt decides to withdraw ambassador from Israel

CAIRO (AP) - The Egyptian Cabinet says it has decided to withdraw its ambassador from Israel over the deaths
of Egyptian security forces in fighting after an ambush targeting Israelis near the border between the two
countries.
   The Cabinet statement issued early Saturday says the ambassador will be withdrawn until Israel investigates
the shooting deaths of five Egyptian security forces.
   The decision comes after Egypt's official news agency blamed the Israelis for shooting and killing the five
while chasing militants who killed eight Israelis in Thursday's ambush across the border in southern Israel.
   The Israeli military promised to investigate.
