I'm sitting here with Dan -- he says that he had suggested putting it in, but folks were concerned that this could hurt

One country we forgot is Cuba which is holding Alan Gross because he tried to help the small Jewish community get
better internet access. There was a piece about Cuba's actions against the internet on NPR this am. Deserves a mention.
