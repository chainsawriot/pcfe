Met with ChineseL

                                                                                                                           B1

I said that some delegations wanted time to get instructions and that the meeting would be held at 11 a.m. on
Sunday. I said that there was nothing happening today or overnight that we were aware of that made it imperative to        1.4(D)
have the meeting today. I asked if they had any urgency about today versus tomorrow




                          Ambassador Churkin was going to speak to the press about the call for a SC meeting — he is
doing so now. Will get you an update when I know more.
Please let me know if you have any advice about any further action or follow up with the Chinese or others.
