Subject: Abbas counters Obama's criticism of unity accord (AP)


AMMAN, Jordan - (AP) Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has defended his unity government
agreement with the militant Islamic Hamas in Gaza in a bid to blunt President Barack Obama's criticism.
   Abbas' comments follow his talks with Jordan's King Abdullah II. Abbas was quoted in a royal palace
statement. They are his first remarks on major speeches the U.S. president delivered in recent days.
   Obama has urged the Palestinians to drop their plans to appeal for U.N. recognition and has raised concerns
about an emerging Palestinian unity government that includes Hamas.
   Abbas said Monday that there was a "wrong understanding" of the unity government. He said ultimately its
decisions would follow his moderate policies.
