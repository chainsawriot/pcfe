Finished for night. We ended up with a fairly good draft on the combined KP/mitigation-anchoring text. The very weak
KP part (not our issue, so we couldn't affect it much, tho Sue helped everyone with ideas) made it mpossible ti get a very
robust anchoring, but we did ok. The MRV draft JP and Jeff got is very good. Whether any of this work will survive the
plenary is a hugely open question. We'll see how it all goes tomorrow. Lots of other issues still very much in play.

In the 11th hour of a meeting hosted by D'Alba with all the bigs and a few others to try to cut the toughest gordian knot
of anchoring pledges Copenhagen Accord as well as dealing with the Kyoto Protocol problem. MRV/ICA meeting going
on elsewhere. Sue and I here, JP and Jeff Klein doing MRV/ICA.

Things still very up in air. Might get a decent outcome, not going to be great. And might not come together at all, tho in
play.
