Subject: New Social Media Resource

Dear Colleagues,

Faced with a rapidly evolving global communications landscape, we must continually evaluate our processes and
procedures to be sure we are using all available tools to effectively reach people everywhere in ways that resonate with
them. As we all know, it is no longer sufficient to merely rely on pushing out press releases in the hope that they will get
picked up and read by our targeted audiences. Consumers today are increasingly demanding information immediately
and sharing that information with their colleagues and communities around the world. As Secretary Clinton has said,
the internet is the public square of the 21st century, and we all shape and are shaped by what happens there. If we are
not participating in conversations when they happen and where they happen, we risk our actions being misunderstood
or deliberately distorted. At best, we run the risk of being marginalized in an increasingly global discourse.

The events of recent months, in the Middle East and elsewhere, have again demonstrated the centrality of social media to
today's most pressing challenges. We know that many Posts are already using a variety of social media tools and platforms,
including Facebook and Twitter. In Washington, we are currently undertaking a broad-based review of the Department's use
of social media. We want to ensure that we are deploying these new tools in ways that are both strategic and supportive of
Posts' needs and that training is taken into consideration. Your input, thoughts and ideas will be a critical part of this process,
and we will be reaching out to all of you in the coming weeks. We recognize that new social media initiatives can be resource-
intensive, and it will require all of us to work together to identify new ways of incorporating them into our on-going
operations to maximize their impact. This may require us to recalibrate and possibly discontinue some programs and
initiatives as we expand our use of these tools, which are fast becoming an essential part of modern diplomacy.

In the meantime, we wanted to alert you to one new resource available to you now. Currently, press guidance and official
statements are developed each day in Washington by your Regional Bureaus and the Bureau of Public Affairs. This
information is provided to you for your use in interviews and media engagements. Going forward, Public Affairs will also
provide that content to you in a format that is customized for Twitter or other micro-blog platforms. The information,
containing policy statements and top-line messages, will be provided on a regular basis in English and the following foreign
language Twitter handles:

As with regularly distributed press guidance,,these twitter feeds are being designed as a resource for Posts, to be used at their
discretion and under circumstances Posts deem appropriate, based on local conditions. Under Posts' direction, the feeds can
be re-tweeted, allowing Posts to focus resources on the response and engagement piece of social media that is so vital and

that can only be provided in the field. Rather than spending time combing through press briefings, official statements or
interview transcripts to find the key messages, PA has pulled them out and packaged them into 140 characters or less and
with the hashtags that will enable new followers to find you. The initial reaction has been overwhelmingly positive,
demonstrating once again that engagement is what makes social media so powerful.

We look forward to working with you in navigating this new landscape for communication and depend on your feedback to
highlight and share local insights and best practices.

Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy
