    Subject: Orthodox Jewish paper apologizes for doctored pic (AP)

    NEW YORK (AP) - An Orthodox Jewish newspaper has apologized for digitally deleting Secretary of State
    Hillary Clinton from a photo of President Barack Obama and his staff watching the operation that killed Osama
    bin Laden.
      The Brooklyn weekly Di Tzeitung (deet SEYE'-tuhng) published the image last week.
      The paper said Monday that its photo editor had not read the "fine print" accompanying the White House
    photo that forbade any changes. The paper says it has sent its "regrets and apologies" to the White House and
    State Department.
      An editor at another weekly that covers Jewish issues addressed why the paper might have altered the image.

The Forward managing editor Lil Swanson says some ultra-Orthodox Jews refuse to run photos of women
because they believe such images are "immodest."
  A second woman was also deleted from the photo: Counterterrorism Director Audrey Tomason.
