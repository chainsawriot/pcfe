 Dear Madame Secretary:

 I hope you are well. I am very proud of your remarkable work. You may remember that during the
 Clinton Administration I was Under Secretary of State for Economic, Business, and Agricultural
 Affairs and I was the chief U.S. negotiator for the Kyoto Protocol. Todd Stern arid Jonathan Pershing
 were key parts of my team.

I have been doing pro bono representation of a remarkable organization fronted by Jeff Horowitz,
Avoided Deforestation Partners, which combines many of the country's major environmental groups
with a number of large electric utility companies. We are dedicated to reducing the rate of global
deforestation, which is a major contribution to greater gas emissions. Tropical forests are also crucial
as habitats for a majority of the world's species, and poor people depend upon forests for their
livelihood.

Our inspiration has been Wangari Maathai, with whom I worked daily. Her premature passing is a
genuine tragedy. I know you share my admiration for her.

I am attaching a letter from me and Jeff Horowitz asking that'you agree to do a short video for an event
at the Durban COP, honoring Wangari and supporting forest preservation.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best wishes.
