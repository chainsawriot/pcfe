Fyi

This crowd is tough. Obviously lots of work ahead. At least they were responsive when we reached out.

SRAP was able to connect with McConnell's senior staffer yesterday and spent about 2 hours briefing him on the state of
play in Pakistan. The staffer started out by saying he'd give our policy in the region an "F" right now but by the end of
the conversation had come around to our side. SRAP reported that it was heartening to see that their briefing had such
an impact with the staffer and are looking to replicate this type of briefing with many of the new incoming staff and
possibly members. We are consulting closely with SRAP to make sure that we've got a strong Leg plan to engage the hill
and to make sure that we're effectively communicating our strategy and our successes.

For now I think our concerns related to their press posture have been addressed as best we can. Between the briefing
and good work by the Embassy to have minimal press in the schedule, we look to be in good shape. Amb. Munter is still
trying to connect with McConnell as a courtesy but I don't have any updates on whether they've had any luck with the
visit and all this week.
