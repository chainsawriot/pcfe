We are still working out the technical details, but you'd be sitting with an Aljazeera correspondent (Ibrahim who has
interviews you 3 times and was supposed to on Thursday). He would present the Qs to you, either by reading them to
you, or showing you the recorded question on a monitor. We'd do this in the State studio
