Wanted to give you the heads up that Dan Restropo, from NSC, will be notifying the US Ambassador to Haiti this
afternoon that the First Lady will be traveling to Haiti on April 13th before she arrives in Mexico City that evening.




Once I receive word that the Ambassador is aware, I'll let you two know.




Please know that this is on CLOSE HOLD and to ward off large crowds, we will NOT be notifying the Haitian government
of our trip until the day before the First Lady arrives.




I'm told commercial flights started operating this week to Port au Prince from the Dominican Republic, so advance
teams should be able to get flights down without using MilAir. I've also been told that there are SOME hotel rooms
available, although I've warned our advance lead and others that its highly likely they'll be sleeping in the Embassy or
something similar. We're finalizing a slate, but given the close hold nature of the trip and the difficulties on the ground
it's likely the team will be very small and land April 8 or 9.




once the Embassy has been alerted, can you please connect us with a control officer? Given everything going on there
and no preadvance, this will be a particular trip where we will have to rely heavily on the control officer and embassy
staff. I'll send you a separate email with types of stops we're looking for.
