Erdogan has not yet issued any statement (and frankly not clear whether he will issue something of his own), but the Tu
NSC issued a long statement after their marathon meeting, most of which was focused on the PKK/terrorism issue.
Here's what was said about Syria:

- We are deeply concerned about civilian deaths for the last 5 months.

- Use of force and violence against civilians must be stopped immediately.

- In the direction of rightful demands of Syrians, democratic and political transformation should take place within a
timetable.

- Once again, the necessity of protecting freedom of expression, right of assembly, and organization of political parties
must be stressed.
