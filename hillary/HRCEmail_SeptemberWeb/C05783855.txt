Subject:                      Must read: Bill Gates on new book by Charles Kenny arguing that foreign assistance has
                              improved lives even where it has not raised incomes



Even Bill Easterly, the guru of "foreign assistance doesn't work," is praising this book. This is
from the NYT Book Review — the review is by bill Gates.


Stepping into the public square to announce that foreign aid is important and effective
can be lonely work. As someone who has attempted to make that case over the past
decade, I can assure you that the world is often eager to hear just the opposite.

But aid money can and does work. It improves people's lives and makes the world a
better and safer place.

Fortunately, an elegant and deeply researched new book has come along to reframe
the debate and tip it, I hope, in a new direction. The title says it all: "Getting Better:
Why Global Development Is Succeeding—and How We Can Improve the World Even
More."

The book's author is Charles Kenny, a senior economist on leave from the World Bank
and a fellow at the Center for Global Development and the New America Foundation.
He writes a weekly column for ForeignPolicy.com as "The Optimist," but he is a realist,
too, and he brings an economist's eye to this complicated topic.

In making his case, Mr. Kenny is going up against some notable critics. Recent books
by writers like Dambisa Moyo and Matt Ridley have depicted aid as wasteful and even
damaging to societies. But even some outspoken aid critics have been impressed by
"Getting Better." One of the best known, the economist William Easterly, even provided
a blurb, praising the book. "You will never look at global economic development the
same way again," he says. To me, that's exactly right.

Mr. Kenny acknowledges that the hundreds of billions of dollars that the West has
poured into poor countries has had a limited impact on income, which is what most
economists use to measure progress in living standards. As he notes, many countries
in Africa today have real per capita incomes lower than that of Britain at the time of the
Roman Empire. Over the past several decades, through good times and bad, the
income gap between rich and poor countries has grown. And no one really knows why.

But income is only one measure of success and maybe not the most meaningful one.
Mr. Kenny shows that quality of life—even in the world's poorest countries—has
improved dramatically over the past several decades, far more than most people
realize. Moreover, with reams of solid data to support his case, he argues that
governments and aid agencies have played an important role in this progress.

We care about income mostly as a proxy for what money can buy: food, shelter,
health, education, security and other factors that contribute to human well-being. Mr.
Kenny's great insight is to point out the flaw in focusing solely on income. Other trends,
related to direct measures of quality of life, are much more encouraging.

Fifty years ago, more than half the world's population struggled with getting enough
daily calories. By the 1990s, this figure was below 10%. Famine affected less than
three-tenths of 1% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa from 1990 to 2005. As Mr.
Kenny suggests, the record has thoroughly disproved Malthusian prophecies of food
shortages caused by spiraling population growth. Family sizes have fallen for many
decades now in every region, including Africa.

And there's more good news. Virtually everywhere, infant mortality is down and life
expectancy is up. In Africa, life expectancy has increased by 10 years since 1960,
despite the continent's HIV pandemic. Nearly 90% of the world's children are now
enrolled in primary schools, compared with less than half in 1950. Literacy rates in the
sub-Saharan region have more than doubled since 1970. Political and civil rights also
have gained ground.

The case made by Mr. Kenny in "Getting Better" is a powerful antidote to overly gloomy
assessments of development aid. Wasteful and corrupt aid projects are probably
inevitable, and they should never be tolerated. But overall, when you look at the big
picture, quite a lot of good things are happening.

What's more, the book suggests ways to make aid more efficient and effective. Mr.
Kenny notes that dramatic improvements in quality of life have been achieved even in
poor countries where incomes have fallen. How can this be? He credits the spread of
new technologies and ideas. Because of them, as he writes, many of "the best things
in life are cheap."

Eradicating smallpox from the face of the Earth, for example, cost about 32 cents per
person in infected countries. In just six years, a drive to vaccinate African children
against measles reduced the number who died of the disease by three-quarters, from
more than 500,000 a year.

Even larger gains in public health can still be achieved at a stunningly low cost relative
to the benefits. Of the 10 million children who die each year in poor countries, one-third
could be saved through the wider use of breast feeding, insecticide-treated bed nets

and oral rehydration therapy (a simple sugar and salt solution) to combat the effects of
diarrhea.

Mr. Kenny recommends focusing development aid on helping to spread such ideas
and the cheap technologies that can measurably improve quality of life. He suggests,
among other things, that we create a global technology bank to fund research or award
prizes for advances that particularly benefit the world's poor.

After years of doom and gloom on the subject of foreign aid, it is refreshing to find so
thoughtful and contrarian an approach to the topic. Charles Kenny shines a light on the
real successes of aid, and he shows us the benefits that additional smart investment
can bring.
