Subject: Saudi activist: 5 women detained for driving (AP)


DUBAI (AP) - A Saudi activist says at least five women have been taken into custody accused of defying the
men-only driving rule in the ultraconservative Arab kingdom.
   The detentions mark the first major backlash by Saudi authorities since a campaign was launched nearly two
weeks ago to challenge the driving restrictions.
   Dozens of women have since driven through the capital Riyadh and other cities.
   Saudi-based rights activist Eman al-Nafjan says police detained a woman Tuesday while driving in Jiddah on
the Red Sea coast. Al-Nafjan says four other women accused of driving were later detained in the city.
   Al-Nafian spoke to The Associated Press on Wednesday. She says there has been no new information on the
status of the detainees.
