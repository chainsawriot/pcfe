Subject: EU's Ashton wants Quartet Mideast talks in February (Reuters)

BETHLEHEM (Reuters) - The EU foreign policy chief called on January 6 for the Quartet of Middle East
mediators to meet early next month to help Israel and the Palestinians overcome a deadlock in peace talks. With
negotiations in limbo for the past three months, the European Union's Catherine Ashton said the EU, Russia, the
United States and United Nations should schedule a high-level meeting to revive the peace process and put it
back on track. "I propose the Quartet meet as soon as possible to help find a solution to the current impasse. The
Munich Security Conference in early February offers a good opportunity," Ashton said at the end of a two-day
visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories. "My trip to the region so early in the year is an expression of my
personal commitment and that of the European Union and its 27 member states to peace in the Middle East,"
she said. "I have urged both Israelis and Palestinians to find a satisfactory way to engage without delay in
substantive negotiations on all final-status issues. There is no alternative to a negotiated solution," she added in
a statement.
