                                           ISLAMABAD: Director General ISI, Lt General Ahmed Shuja Pasha Friday admitting failure
                                          In the Osama killing episode in Abbottabad, sought apology from the nation and added
                                          that he would resign if the parliament so demands, Geo News reported.

                                          "The failure was not intentional but I admit that it was a mistake," the ISI Chief said
                                          during the in-camera joint sitting of the parliament.

                                          On this Opposition Leader Chaudhry Nisar said: "Since ISI has accepted the failure, now
                                          there is need to fix the responsibility." He demanded that there has to be some kind of
                                          reparation for everything that went wrong.

                                          Earlier, Federal Minister for Information Firdaus Ashiq Awan quoted The ISI chief as
                                          saying: " I surrenders myself before the parliament".

She said the DG ISI had accepted responsibility of the (Abbottabad) incident, and that he was ready to present himself for
accountability at any forum including the Parliament.
