Richard is--as usual--defying the odds and making steady progress altho his condition is still critical and he faces a long
recovery. He's by no means out of danger, but miracles do happen thx to superb medical help and a very strong
constitution aided by a strong will. Keep your prayers heading his way. Come see me when you're back--and pis give
Mrs. M my warmest best wishes.

I'm so devastated by Holbrooke's terrible health situation. Several of his staff have told me that you've been such a
support to them. I only hope that his feisty spirit will help him now. It's hard to imagine him down.
Mrs Mubarak has done a magnificent job with the conference. She asked me to go to a couple of the schools she has
renovated in the poorest neighborhoods of Luxor as part of her schools' program. They are state of the art and become
magnets for redevelopment. She sends her best. You have been mentioned with great affection repeatedly here by so
many. I also went to a huge community renunciation of FGM in a rural area -- some 2000 villagers with men speaking
eloquently about why this practice would be no more. This is another great effort they are making here to end FGM
through community education. So amidst bad news, there is also the good. We also managed to dodge the latest
wikileaks story here. Heading back tomw.
