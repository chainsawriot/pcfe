Dear Penn,

Please forgive my belated response which in no way reflects my delight in hearing from you but rather my challenge in
finding time to respond to friends like you. One of many reasons why I'm looking forward to moving on come January
2013!

                                     pis thank her for the important work she is doing on behalf of kids here and globally.

I'd love to do the video for Al So!nit's program and room and will be sure Lauren sets up the video.

And pls tell Gabriella how delighted I am she was on a State Dept-sponsored cultural program and wish her continuing
success.

Pls send the Morrison book to Lauren for printing. I'm copying her on this so she knows about video and book.




Be well, my friend and enjoy the rest of summer! H

Hi Hillary,

Enjoyed your valuable Hong Kong comments.

Here are notes on new things and followups.

1. Thursday, 7/28, there will be visitors to your place
                                                                                       It is Project Common Bond, run by
Tuesday's Children (as in Tues 9/11), a program for young people from around the world whose lives have been
specifically impacted by terrorism. The group includes several from 9/11 and a number from 10 other countries. They're
working in groups with various therapists, conflict resolution trainers and others to make their ways, make connectionsand
understandings, forge bonds and bring good things home. They were told they are meeting with a senior official in yr bldg
and are obviouysly hoping it's you.
