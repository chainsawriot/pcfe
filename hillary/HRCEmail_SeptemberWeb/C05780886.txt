CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt referred on Sunday its former prime minister and finance minister to court on charges
of squandering public funds, the public prosecutor's office said.

   Former Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif is now detained for investigations and Youssef Boutrous Ghali, the
former finance minister, is abroad.

   Habib el-Adli, the former interior minister, who is already facing trial on charges of killing protesters and
graft, will be tried on the same charges.
