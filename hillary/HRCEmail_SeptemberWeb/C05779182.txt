Judith,

We've just received new data from Pakistan, and I wanted to share with you the latest findings on U.S. image. Favorable
opinion of the U.S. has fallen somewhat. The attachment provides an overview and trend line.

We are in the process of analyzing the data and hope to be ready with a full briefing on the material in a week or two. If
you have questions or would like additional information, please contact me or our Pakistan analyst, Tim Gembicki.

Thanks,
Anna
