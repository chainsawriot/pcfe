Subject: Palestinian state requires UN council support (AP)

UNITED NATIONS - (AP)                        The president of the U.N. General Assembly says there is no way for Palestine to
become a member of the United Nations without a recommendation from the Security Council.
  Joseph Deiss told a news conference Friday that if the U.S. or any other permanent council member used its
veto, the General Assembly would not be able to vote on membership for Palestine.
  He recalled that a General Assembly resolution adopted in 1947 at the end of the British mandate in Palestine
provides for the creation of two states, one Arab, one Jewish.
