I saw him at the memorial and he has expanded since that he's told Ban ki Moon he will take the job of UN Special Rep
for Haiti IF he can work on a common strategy and platform with you, your husband and Paul Farmer.
He wants to meet with Prez C in NY and is willing to come to DC whenever suitable for you to discuss with you.
