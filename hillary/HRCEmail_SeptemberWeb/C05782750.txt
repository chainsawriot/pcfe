Subject: 100 detained in Moscow amid nationalist rally call (AP)


MOSCOW (AP) - Police in Moscow have detained about 100 people suspected of planning a nationalist rally
near the Kremlin.
   Police spokesman Anatoly Lastovetsky said some of those detained on Manezh Square were carrying
weapons including pistols that fire rubber bullets.
   A heavy contingent of police was deployed in and around the sprawling square after calls appeared on the
Internet for an unauthorized gathering to mark the death a week ago of an 18-year-old in a nightclub fight
between a group of soccer fans and men of Caucasus descent.
   Violence between ethnic Russians and people from the Caucasus is frequent.
   In December, about 5,000 people chanting "Russia for Russians" gathered at Manezh Square and beat dark-
skinned passers-by. That gathering was a reaction to the killing of a Russian soccer fan during a fight with
people from the Caucasus.
