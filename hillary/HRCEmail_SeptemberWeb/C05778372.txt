Should I be flattered? Even a little bit? And, as for my alibi, well, let's just say it depends on the snow and the secret
service. So, subject to cross for sure. Do you think there could be copycats? Do you think the guy chose that mask or just
picked up the nearest one? Please keep me informed as the case unfolds--

On another matter, can you believe Dan Burton will be the chair of one of the House subcommittees we'll have to deal
w? Irony and satire are the only sane responses.

Happy New Year--and here's hoping for many more stories that make us laugh!

She does, uh, have an alibi, I presume?

'Masked   'Hillary Clinton' robs Va. bank

By Elizabeth Flock




A gun-toting man in a Halloween-style mask robbed a Sterling bank on Dec. 27, authorities said.

It appeared that the man wore a Hillary Clinton mask,
<http://www. loudou ntimes.com/index. php/news/article/man_posing_as_u .s._secretary_of_state_robs_sterling_bank_
at_gunpoint/> according to Kraig Troxell, spokesman for the Loudoun County Sheriffs Office.

Shortly after 9 a.m., the man walked into the Wachovia bank in Community Plaza, approached a teller, brandished a
firearm, and demanded cash, according to Loudoun County sheriff's office reports.

The robber, who authorities described as a black male around 6 feet tall, then fled in an unknown direction with an
undisclosed amount of cash. He was seen wearing a black jacket with a red shirt underneath.

No injuries were reported, says Kraig Troxell, spokesman for the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office, which distributed a
surveillance image from the robbery.

This robbery is not the first for the Wachovia bank in Sterling's Community Plaza this year. On Nov. 20, authorities said
the bank was robbed at gunpoint by Benjamin L. Sebastian
<http://www.loudountimes.com/index.php/news/article/police_name_west_virginia_man_as_suspect_in regional_ban
k_robberies480/> , 32, of Inwood, W.Va.

Sebastian was arrested Dec. 11 and charged with six regional bank robberies
<http://www.loudountimes.com/index.php/news/article/police_name_west_virginia_man_as_suspect_in_regional_ban
k_robberies480/> , including the Sterling Wachovia bank and an Oct. 6 armed robbery
<http://sterling.wusa9.com/content/west-virginia-man-charged-connection-two-sterling-bank-robberies> of the Bank
of America in Sterling's Regal Plaza.

He remains in police custody.

Authorities are asking anyone with information about the incident to contact Investigator K. Poland of the Loudoun
County Sheriff's Office at 703-777-0475.
