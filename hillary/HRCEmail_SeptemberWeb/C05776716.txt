Subject: Latest Draft of Foreign Affairs

Here is the latest draft, which incorporates your changes and suggestions, and has been through each of us (me, Jake,
and AMS) at least once. There may still be a few facts to be tweaked and we are looking for one more example from
WHA for the Mexico paragraph. I will also re-read it carefully later tonight and tomorrow morning to catch any typos,
weird grammar, or things that don't flow. I'm too close to it now and want to read it again when I'm fresh. But hopefully
this is close to final.

Lissa
