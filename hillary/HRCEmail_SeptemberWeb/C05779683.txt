You may have heard from Cheryl, but latest from Johnnie on potential military action:

Jake: UNOCI is slated to launch a major strike against Gbagbo's tanks, armored vehicles and heavy guns tomorrow
morning. UNSG Ban spoke to Sarko and the French have agreed to take part in this operation. Ban confirmed this in a
conversation with Susan Rice earlier today. UNOCI has withdrawn most of its civilian staff and relocated them to Boauke
In the northern Cot D'Ivoire. There have been lots of rumors swirling that the French were going to evacuate their
citizens but this does not appear to be in the works yet. I will call my French counterpart early tomorrow morning to see
if he can shed some light on French thinking. Our people are safe and are in no immediate or direct threat.
