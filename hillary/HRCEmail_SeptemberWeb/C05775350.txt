HRC:

You may remember many years ago when olympic champion swimmer diana nyad tried to swim from cuba to florida
and failed. Diana wants to try again as part of an ongoing commitment she has to promoting fitness among older
people. As you can see from this email she needs your help to get clearance. I wouldnt ask if i didnt think taking it to
your level is the only way to get it done.

Thanks so much in advance for looking into this. I know it is a busy month for you. You are just the best!!!

Hilary Rosen




          From: Diana Nyad




          In full appreciation of Hilary's always-hectic life....and particularly her
          current high-octane stresses with the oil spill work....I thought it easiest for
          her to simply show her below a letter I wrote this week to hopeuflly be
          delivered to Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, dem out
          of FL, in a desperate plea for help to get me and my expedition cleared
          intto Cuba.

           The basics for Hilary to know are that CNN is covering the entire summer's
           event I'm doing live.
           24-hour training swim off Key West next week-end.
           The Cuba Swim early August, weather dictating.

           It's not that I've been flat turned down by the State Dept. But I have been

        told I won't be approved this summer warm water, my training, all of
        it....there's no other time I can or will do it.

        It's going to be a terribly upbeat story to follow (in CLEAN ocean just
        nearby the oil spill), it's going to be an embraced strong message to
        redefine middle age as strong and relevant, to see a 60-year old
        swim 103 miles and walk up onto the shores of her own country.

        I have been told by lawyers within Treasury that it will take either
        Hilary Clinton or Obama himself to clear my event.
        I know somebody has the power to green light in an hour's time, if
        I can just get to the right person.

        . Please know that I wouldn't
        interrupt either your or Hilary's precious holiday week-end if
        I hadn't committed a year of hardship training to this and now involved
        many good people in the adventure.
        I just can't let this dream slip away because I can't get into Cuba
        with State Dept approval.

        Here is the Schultz doc below. And next I'm going to send you a
        link to a short promo video.

        Thanks so very, very much,
        diana



        DIANA NYAD CUBA SWIM




        EXECUTIVE SUMMARY




       At the end of July, 2010, just a month from now, I will attempt to become the first person in history to swim the
103 miles from Cuba to Florida without the aid of a shark cage.

        In 1978, I swam out of Havana into a raging sea. 41hrs, 49mins later, it was not to be.

         I'm 60 now. This time, when I do walk up onto the Florida shore, I will send a loud message to all the millions my
age that 60 is not irrelevant, that we are still strong, vital, vibrant individuals, that our best days are not by any means all
behind us.




        For 30 years, I hadn't swum a stroke. I valued physical fitness to an extreme degree, but just hadn't swum at all
for 30 years. And now this past year's training is done. It has been intense. Many, many 10, 12, 15 hour swims in the
Caribbean. Grueling tests of both body and spirit.

       But I was naive to think the training would be the tough part. I am feeling strong and confident. But the
government permissions for me to walk off the Cuban shore are keeping me from my Dream.




          I first went to the Cuban Interest Section and was told the Cubans would eagerly welcome my event. They
remember my first attempt and I have been back many times for clinics and such. But they said I would definitely need
to first have approval from the State Department. I was told there that it is a sensitive time politically, that both Obama
and Hilary Clinton are very much pro-embargo and it would take perhaps a year to procure State Department clearance.




        On advice from three lawyers from Sonnenschein in D.C., I was told that it would take a direct green light from
Hilary herself to get this expedition cleared.

        Because I have been stymied by Treasury and the State Dept, I let the Cuban Interest Section permissions go so
now I don't have permissions from their end, either.




        I am going to make one last attempt to get this done legally by contacting Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman
Schultz. Perhaps in light of a positive story vis a vis Florida Tourism....there is beautifully clean water, not far from the oil
disaster and the heroic message of a 60-year-old swimming 100 miles and walking up onto the shores of her own
country, her own home state, Congresswoman Schultz could champion the project into full legal status, from both the
Cuban and the State Department sides.




        CNN is the exclusive broadcast coverer of my swim. I am just tonight on the front page of CNN.com.

        There will no doubt be much positive news to come from this story...and to Florida... .throughout my endeavor.




        I will do a 24-hour training swim off Key West the week-end of July 10-11. CNN will cover live.

       And then the hope is to go over to Havana on July 23 (or wait at a training camp in Key West starting on July 23)
and then get the Cuba swim started whenever Mother Nature gives us a forecast of calm seas.
