Huma:

Happy New Year! As you board the plane and prepare to depart, please know that we are deeply grateful for the
tremendous effort that you have made to allow the Secretary to participate in Brazil's historic inauguration.

The press here has focused intently on the Secretary's decision to participate, and has given prominent play to the
statements that have come out of the White House and the Department describing the importance of our bilateral
relationship. The Foreign Ministry and Dilma's transition team have given a very positive spin to the Secretary's role in
the inauguration, and made clear that she is very welcome. Among the general public, the news has provoked a deep
sigh of relief and is seen as evidence of our willingness to work with the new President and overcome the recent
problems that have complicated our relationship.

When the Secretary arrives, she will also find a collection of heads of state looking to have a word with her. The format
in PlanaIto will allow this to take place during the ceremony and immediately afterwards. In particular, Colombian
President Santos has asked to speak with the Secretary. Also, last night the Peruvian ambassador told me that
President Garcia will go to PlanaIto to speak with her. I am sure others will line up to greet her.

The Brazilians have worked hard to meet our logistical and security requirements, and the movements today should be
smooth. Of course, if you can convince the pilots to fly fast and get here early it will be better for everyone.

Again, thanks for your great help. Your effort, and the Secretary's incredible stamina and willingness to go the extra
mile (or extra 4,000 miles), will pay big dividends.

Regards,
Tom
