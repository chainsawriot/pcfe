Subject: Conservative Hammond named as UK Defence Secretary -Sky (Reuters),

LONDON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister David Cameron has appointed Conservative Philip
Hammond as his new defence secretary, Sky News said on Friday, filling a gap left by the resignation of Liam
Fox.

   Hammond, regarded as a safe pair of hands who had held the transport ministry brief, will oversee Britain's
military operations in Afghanistan and Libya as well as sweeping, cost-cutting reforms to the military.

   Fox resigned on Friday following a scandal over his close ties to a businessman who posed as his unofficial
adviser, dealing a blow to Cameron's Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government.
