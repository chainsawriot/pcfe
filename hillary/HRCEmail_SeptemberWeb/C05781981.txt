Subject: Turkey's Erdogan expects Syrian reforms within 15 days (Reuters)


ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday he hoped Syria would take
steps towards reform within 10-15 days and that Ankara gave a clear message to Damascus to halt the
bloodshed resulting from the brutal repression of pro-democracy protests.

  Erdogan, whose Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu visited Syria on Tuesday, said Turkey's ambassador to
Damascus had visited the besieged city of Hama and reported back that tanks were leaving the city.
