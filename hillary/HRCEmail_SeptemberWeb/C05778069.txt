ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Talks between six world powers and Iran, aimed at persuading Tehran to rein in its
nuclear programme, will resume but no date or venue has been set, a senior Iranian official said January 22.
   "There will be talks but stilll we haven't decided on the place or venue," Abolfazl Zohrevand, an aide to
Iran's chief negotiator Saeed Jalili, told, Reuters at the end of two days of talks in Istanbul between the world
powers and Iran.
   European Union Foreign Policy chief Catherine Ashton, who led delegations from the United States, Britain,
France, Russia, China and Germany, said world powers were "disappointed" by Iran's stance during the talks in
