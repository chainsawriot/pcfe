Subject: UAE and Saudi re Bahrain

Jim, Rick, Susan, Doug: there are rumors that Saudi and UAE forces are on the causeway to Bahrain, ie on the verge of
intervening. I have called Adel (who said he'd check) and am now trying AbZ. We need to know if anything is
happening. Please let us know what you can get.
