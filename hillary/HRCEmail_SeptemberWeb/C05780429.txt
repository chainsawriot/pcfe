GENEVA (AP) - The United Nations and international aid groups say the spreading conflict between North and
South Sudan is driving thousands more people from their homes.
   The International Organization for Migration says almost 106,000 people are displaced in the Abyei region
alone.
   The U.N. aid coordination office says heavy fighting occurred June 9 in South Kordofan State and the
northern part of Unity State.
   The two areas lie on either side of the disputed border between North and South Sudan.
   U.N. spokeswoman Elisabeth Byrs says aid agency offices in the capital of South Kordofan, Kadugli, have
been looted.
   She told reporters in Geneva June 10 that most local and international aid staff have fled the Kadugli area.
