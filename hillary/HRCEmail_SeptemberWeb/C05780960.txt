Subject:                        Kerry-McCain Libya Res. Debate -- Postponed


Madam Secretary,

By unanimous consent, the cloture motion with respect the motion to proceed to S.J.Res.20, the Kerry-
McCain resolution regarding Libya, was vitiated and the motion to proceed to S.J.Res.20 was
withdrawn. In other words, the Senate will not be taking up the resolution this week as had been
originally planned. No date for resumption of the debate has been announced.

Rather, Leader Reid signaled the Senate will instead focus on the budget this week.

A brief transcript of Reid's floor statement is below.

Thanks.

MR. REID: MR. CHAIRMAN, THE SENATE WAS SCHEDULED TODAY AT




      5:00 TO VOTE ON THE MOTION TO INVOKE CLOTURE ON THE MOTION TO

      PROCEED TO THE BIPARTISAN LIBYA RESOLUTION WHICH WAS SPONSORED

      BY SENATORS KERRY, McCAIN, LEVIN, KYL, DURBIN, FEINSTEIN,

      GRAHAM, AND OTHERS. I'VE SPOKEN WITH THE REPUBLICAN LEADER JUST

      A SHORT TIME AGO, AND WE'VE AGREED NOTWITHSTANDING THE BROAD

      SUPPORT FOR THE LIBYA RESOLUTION, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR

      US TO FOCUS ON THIS WEEK IS THE BUDGET. SO WE'LL WORK TO

      RECIPIENT A VOTE ON -- TO SET UP A VOTE ON THE SENSE OF THE

      SENATE RESOLUTION THAT I HAVE OFFERED ON SHARED SACRIFICE AND

      PROCESS NOW AND WILL CONTINUE ON THE DEBT LIMIT AND THE LARGER

      DEBT MATTER THROUGHOUT THE CAPITOL AND I'M CONFIDENT EVERYONE
