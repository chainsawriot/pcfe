Subject: Georgian President Saakashvili, etc.

Saakashvili confirmed the call for 7:30 AM tomorrow. Should Ops reach you at your NY home, or on your
blackberry? Also, we got word that Lavrov is travelling tomorrow and hasn't indicated whether or not he will be able to
talk tomorrow morning. And still no work from Al-Faisal. Ops is still trying on both â€” and I'll keep you apprised of any
updates.
