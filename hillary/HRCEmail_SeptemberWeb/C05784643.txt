If this is in fact true, I think                                                                             B5

Let's see if it's confirmed.

Let's see what Mulet says.

Subject: CEP Rejected OAS Recommendations

On a tip frorr                 who informed me minutes ago that Dorsinvil and thee other CEP members handed his
                          a document containing the confirmation of the BCEN's rulings, rejecting thus the JEOM's
recommendations, to be handed to presidential aide Enech Jean-Charles for publication in Le Moniteur.

I calle          who confirmed the information. He acnowledged the quandary, expressed fear for his safety should he
not comply. He recognized that the JEOM's conclusions were correct, but felt powerless not to proceed as directed by
Dorsinvil. I asked him to call SRSG Mulet, but he did not have the phone number.

Cheers!
