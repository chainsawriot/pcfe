Mr. Feldman,

Per Jake's instructions this morning, I am provisionally sending you the e-signed letter. However, also per Jake, this
should NOT be handed over to the Pakistanis until we have the Secretary's approval to do so.

Huma â€” please let us know as soon as you hear back from her this morning.

Regards, Laura

Subject: S-Gilani letter update

The package is with S specials, including an Action Memo. Cameron just called me, and asked us to let him know when it
was signed, the earlier on Mon the better, as he's going to use it as the basis for pushback with the opening of
Parliament tmw (eg, Gilani will speak at 7 am EST Mon to Parliament, but will hopefully not take the more adverse
position on consular immunity). Given as well the Guardian piece which just broke in Pak (though Cameron said it had
seemingly been downplayed in the local press, and was below the fold in both Urdu and English papers) , Cameron
wants to do backgrounding with any journalists writing on this, and to have the Gilani letter out as a resource for that
would be helpful to him. Thx, DF
