Robert Pape is a top strategic thinker from U of Chicago who is best known for his empirical work showing a strong

Dear Anne-Marie,




As we discussed during your salon dinner with Steve Clemons at Nora's, I am developing a practical strategy of "off-
shore/on-shore balancing" that would involve key USG agencies.




As the attached proposal explains, the new strategy is substantially different from previous historical constructs in the
literature on American grand strategy and offers important advantages to improve our position in Afghanistan and other
regions in the world in the coming years.

Going forward, I would like make sure I have State's views correct. If you and your staff could meet with me later next
week, this would greatly help.




I look forward to further discussion.

Bob
