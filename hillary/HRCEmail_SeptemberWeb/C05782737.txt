Subject: Yemen president says will leave power in coming days (Reuters)

SANAA, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Yemen's President Ali Abdullah Saleh said on Saturday he would leave power in the
coming days after the country has been largely paralysed by nearly nine months of mass protests against his 33
year rule.

   "I reject power and I will continue to reject it, and I will be leaving power in the coming days," he said in a
speech on state television.

   Saleh has been clinging to his position while opposition and ruling party representatives cast about for a
formula to see through a transition-of-power deal.
