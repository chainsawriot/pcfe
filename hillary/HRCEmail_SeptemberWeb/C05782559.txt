Subject: Niger says would respect court commitments on Gaddafi



NIAMEY (Reuters) - Niger would respect its commitments to the International Criminal Court if Libya's
Muammar Gaddafi or his sons entered the country, the head of President Mahamadou Issoufou's cabinet told
Reuters September 9.

   "We are signatories of the Rome Statute (of the International Criminal Court), so they know what they are
exposed to if they come. Niger is a country of rights but we will also respect our international commitments,"
cabinet director Massaoudou Hassoumi said.

    Britain and other countries in the international coalition backing Libyan insurgents against Gaddafi have said
this week they would expect any ICC signatory country to hand him over to the Hague-based court.
