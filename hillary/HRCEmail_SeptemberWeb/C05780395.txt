Pressure ramps up on Anthony Weiner to resign

has begun to build within Democratic circles for Rep. Anthony Weiner to step aside although the embattled
New York Democrat remains resolute that he is staying in office.

Pennsylvania Democratic Rep. Allyson Schwartz said Wednesday that "having the respect of your constituents
is fundamental for a Member of Congress," adding: "In light of Anthony Weiner's offensive behavior online, he
should resign."

Such a strong statement by Schwartz, who handles recrutiment as well as member services for the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, is widely regarded as a sign that the party leadership has decided it's time
for Weiner to leave the House.

Schwartz joins Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor and Maine Rep. Mike Michaud as well as former Democratic
National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine in calling on Weiner to step aside.

Weiner, according those close to him, remains insistent that he has broken no laws and has no plans to leave the
House. It remains to be seen whether Schwartz's statement will open a floodgate of public condemnation that
will alter Weiner's political calculus.

Democratic leaders have largely stayed silent about Weiner's political fate since he revealed in a press

target for Empire State redistricters who must shrink the congressional delegation by two members before next
November.

The problem for Democrats is that Weiner has shown little inclination to step aside and, barring a full House
vote to expel him, likely could hang on to his seat at least until the election next year.

Such a drawn-out ordeal is a nightmare for Democratic strategists who would like the Weiner story out of the
news as soon as possible.
