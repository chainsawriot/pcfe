MEMO
FROM: Sen. Jon Kyl, Sen. Bob Corker
TO: Republican Members
DATE: November 24, 2010
RE: Progress in Defining Nuclear Modernization Requirements


       We appreciate your willingness to consider New START in the context of modernization of our
nuclear complex and the weapons it supports.

      In advance of having an opportunity to discuss the issue more fully next week in Washington,
we want to summarize the status of our discussions with the administration.

 Summary
         Throughout the Obama administration's pursuit of a New START treaty, we have been clear,
 as has Secretary Gates,' that we could not support reductions in U.S. nuclear forces unless there is
 adequate attention to modernizing those forces and the infrastructure that supports them. The
 Administration's recent update of the 1251 plan, originally submitted in May in accordance with
 Section 1251 of the FY2010 NDAA, is an acknowledgment that more resources are needed to
 accomplish the objectives set forth in the Nuclear Posture Review for the modernization of the U.S.
 nuclear deterrent. This memo discusses our concerns with the original 1251 plan, changes made and
 our assessment of those changes and remaining issues.
 Background – the Decline of the Nuclear Weapon Stockpile and Infrastructure


          Since the end of the Cold War, the U.S. nuclear weapons infrastructure (including laboratories,
 production facilities and supporting capabilities) has been allowed to deteriorate. The weapons have
 remained safe, secure and reliable, but they and their caretakers have been in a state of limbo—only
 when critical problems have arisen has action been taken. The production facilities are Cold War
 relics, safety and security costs have grown exponentially, and critical skills have been jeopardized
 through layoffs, hiring freezes, and the retirement of skilled scientists and technicians who earlier were
 able to fully exercise the full set of nuclear weapons-related skills. In FY2010, the Obama
 administration invested only $6.4 billion in the National Nuclear Security Administration Weapons
 Activities funding line, a 20% loss in purchasing power from FY2005 alone.2 It is no longer possible to
 continue deferring maintenance of either the facilities or the weapons. As a result, the 2010 Nuclear
 Posture Review set forth a broad range of modernization and sustainment requirements that would be
 impossible without additional budget support.
         A detailed explanation of these concepts is located in the appendix to this memo; but to help
 understand the current situation, imagine an automotive expert working in a garage built in 1942. The
 roof leaks and his tools are becoming outdated. Moreover, he has responsibility for a fleet of eight

racing Ferraris, which have been sitting in storage for about 30 years. The last time any engine was
turned on was 1992, but this "steward" is responsible for assuring that, at any given moment, each of
the eight finely-tuned cars will respond to the key turn. To do this, he is allowed to assess components
of the cars for aging—leaks, cracks, rust, etc. (though he isn't able to look at the components often
enough and in sufficient detail because of his maintenance budget).

        Even on a shoe-string budget, he is beginning to see signs of age throughout the fleet, and
realizes that each and every car will require a complete overhaul (a "life extension" program). To be
successful, he needs a new garage, updated tools, and skilled assistants (because truthfully, the expert
will be retiring long before the overhauls are complete, assuming his pension fund is still solvent). He
will have to replace some of the parts (especially the electronics – some of his fleet of Ferraris still
have vacuum tubes), because they just aren't available anymore; but some parts will have to be reused,
or manufactured to be as close to the original as possible. Some of the original parts contained
materials that are now illegal for safety or environmental reasons. To add to the problem, the owner is
asking for air bags, anti-lock brakes and anti-theft technology. Each overhaul will take about a decade,
from planning through execution and without a new garage, he will be unable to finish the overhauls
on time. And at the end of the day, the mechanic is fairly certain that he will not be allowed to turn
the ignition to check his work.

       This is the state of our nuclear deterrent today, except, we're dealing not with cars, but with the
most sophisticated and dangerous weapons ever devised by man.

Section 1251 Plan and FY2011 Budget – A Response to the Nuclear Posture Review


        The initial section 1251 report showed a ten-year budget plan for Weapons Activities totaling
$80 billion. But most of that $80 billion is not directed at modernization activities called for in the
NPR—it is mostly consumed in "keeping the lights on" at the laboratories and plants, including safety,
security, facility upkeep (which is difficult on very old facilities that would have been replaced long
ago in the private sector), and routine warhead maintenance.

        Only about $10 billion of that ten year number was for new weapons activity, about half of it
coming from DOD and half from "savings" assumed from low inflation projections. We doubt such
savings can be realized and the DOD funding is not enough to cover everything that needs to be done.
It provides for a small increase to stockpile surveillance for warhead evaluation, funding for the W76
life extension program and the B61 and W78 life extension studies, and partial funding for badly-
needed design, engineering and a modest investment for construction of new plutonium and uranium
processing facilities—the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement (CMRR) nuclear facility
and the Uranium Processing Facility (UPF).3 These new facilities will replace Manhattan Project-era
buildings that are a substantial maintenance burden and are becoming increasingly challenging to
maintain in a safe and operable condition.

       Recognizing that more money was needed up front, the administration's FY2011 budget
request of $7.0 billion for Weapons Activities improved the FY2010 budget by $624 million. The



3 The CMRR and UPF funding was based on estimated facility costs of $2 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, with a
2022 completion date for both facilities.

 $624 million was included as a budget "anomaly" in the two month C.R. we passed before the October
 recess, but will have to be maintained in the longer-term C.R. or Omnibus we will pass in December.

          The initial 1251 plan left a lot of questions about how all the work articulated in the NPR
 would be funded. Numerous experts expressed concerns about obvious shortfalls in funding and about
 restrictions placed on designers that will constrain their ability to work through stockpile issues. The
 funding levels for CMRR and UPF were of significant concern, as was the funding for Life Extension
 Programs—especially to incorporate improved safety, security and reliability in these warheads. And
 of great concern to the directors of the national weapons laboratories, much of the promised budget
 increase for modernization was not pledged until FY16, by which point the Administration's
 commitment (if it is still in office) may have waned.4 As a result, we requested an update to the 1251
 plan that would answer the questions we raised and that would show a stronger commitment to
 modernization.

 Updated 1251 Plan


          After reviewing our questions, and with further review of the requirements imposed by the
 NPR, the Administration agreed that updated budgets were required.5 Thus, on November 17, 2010, an
 updated 1251 report was provided to the Senate, including an early FY12 budget projection with White
 House approval.6 The 1251 update, and the briefing provided as part of the update, satisfied many, but
 not all, of the initial questions we had earlier expressed.
         The 1251 plan update increases the FY2012 budget request by an additional $600 million,
 increases the FY2012 five-year plan by $4.1 billion, and adds to the total FYI I ten-year plan between
 $5.4 and $6.2 billion. We are told that the new increases will not be taken from the DOD budget line.
 This update brings the ten-year plan (from FY11) to between $85.4 and $86.2 billion. *Again,
 approximately $70 billion of the original pledge of $80 billion was needed just to maintain current
 operations of the nuclear weapons complex, without covering the expense of the needed modernization
 of the stockpile or infrastructure. This update also includes revised cost estimates for CMRR and
 UPF; those estimates now range from $3.7 to $5.8 billion for CMRR and $4.2 to $6.5 billion for UPF.

         The new $4.1 billion for the five years of the FY2012 FYNSP is divided as follows:

         •    $340 million for design and engineering and modest construction activity for CMRR and
              UPF (see below for more detail);

         •    $1.7 billion (approximately) for other facility construction and maintenance requirements,
              including the High Explosive Pressing Facility at Pantex and test facilities at Sandia
              National Laboratories;

        •   $1.0 billion (approximately) for stockpile work, with added funding for life extension
            programs, stockpile surveillance and other design and research activities, though some of
            this funding ($255 million for the W76) is only needed because one life extension program
            will take longer due to the capacity bottleneck in the complex;

        •   $1.1 billion for contractor pension obligations spread through Weapons Activities accounts
            (which, while needed, does not support modernization).

 Remaining Concerns

         Despite this new increase, there remain a few substantial concerns about the adequacy of the
proposed budget. For one, the Administration is attempting to address the enormous increases in the
cost estimates for CMRR and LTPF by delaying the full operation of those facilities by one to two
years. This would stretch the final completion of CMRR to 2023 and UPF to 2024, although the
Administration states that some operational capability would be established (as required) in 2020. If
extended, hundreds of millions of dollars would be needed annually to maintain Manhattan Project-era
facilities at LANL & Y-12. Additional funding could be applied to accelerate the construction of
these facilities to ensure on schedule completion and prevent wasted investments in maintaining
and securing facilities that are being replaced anyway.

        Furthermore, the Administration is ignoring the benefits of ensuring funding commitments for
these facilities early in the budget process. Responsible advance funding mechanisms exist, such as a
FY12 request for three-year rolling funding (recommended by some NNSA budget specialists 7), or
alternatively, an Administration commitment to seek advanced funding in FY13 following the
completion of the 90% design cost estimate. Further Administration effort to advance funding is
the best path to successful completion of these facilities.

        Given the need to live with our currently aging stockpile until an adequate production
capability is established (after 2020), accurate assessment of the state of the current stockpile is
paramount. The 1251 plan update shows a doubling of surveillance funding from FY09 to FY11—
which is commendable—but it is our understanding that the NNSA is reviewing an updated
surveillance plan that could lead to greater budget requirements. NNSA should affirm that this
review been completed and the budget request will reflect updated requirements.

         Finally, the 1251 update made clear that NNSA will not restore a production capability
adequate to maintain our current stockpile levels (declassified as 5,113 weapons total), and instead
allow up to 1,500 warheads to be retired or held with no maintenance unless funding increases are
sought and obtained. Failing to maintain hedge weapons will increase the risk that the U.S. cannot
respond to a problem in our aging stockpile. The Administration should not engage in further cuts
to our deployed or non-deployed stockpile without first determining if such cuts are in our
national security interest and then obtaining corresponding reductions in other nations' nuclear
weapons stockpiles, such as Russia's large stockpile of weapons not limited by New START (e.g.,
its tactical nuclear weapons).

Modernization of U.S. strategic delivery systems

        The 1251 update deals not only with our nuclear weapons, bu the delivery systems that are part
of our TRIAD. The update indicates somewhat clearer intent by the Administration to pursue a
follow-on heavy bomber (though not specifically nuclear) and air-launched cruise missile (ALCM),
though development costs beyond FY 2015 are yet to be determined. While the update notes that
estimated costs for a follow-on bomber for FY 2011 through FY 2015 are $1.7 billion, there are still no
costs or funding commitments beyond FY 2015. It is the same for the ALCM: $800 million is
programmed over the FYDP, but no cost estimates are included beyond FY 2015. We should have a
better idea of these estimated costs over the full ten-years of the 1251 plan, and know whether
the, Administration intends to make this new heavy bomber and ALCM nuclear capable.


        Decision-making for an ICBM follow-on is unlikely before FY 2015, at the completion of an
ongoing analysis of alternatives. The update notes: "While a decision on an ICBM follow-on is not
needed for several years, preparatory analysis is needed and is in fact now underway. This work will
consider a range of deployment options, with the objective of defining a cost-effective approach for an
ICBM follow-on that supports continued reductions in U.S. nuclear weapons while promoting stable
deterrence." (emphasis added) We think it important to understand what the Administration intends
when it suggests that a decision regarding a follow-on ICBM must be guided, in part, by whether it
"supports continued reductions" in U.S. nuclear weapons — especially since we seriously doubt it's in
our interests to pursue reductions beyond the New START treaty. One logical inference from this
criterion is that a follow-on ICBM is no longer needed because the U.S. is moving to drastically lower
numbers of nuclear weapons. We continue to press for a letter from the DOD confirming its
commitment to follow-on nuclear-capable delivery systems.


Conclusion

        Until these issues are resolved, it will be difficult to adequately assess the updated 1251 plan,
despite the welcome increases in proposed spending. And as has always been clear, assurances from
the appropriate authorizers and appropriators must be obtained to ensure that the enacted budget
reflects the President's request.

                                                         APPENDIX


          Briefly, some of the stockpile programs most affected by the lack of Administration support for
    modernization include:

•   Replacing Manhattan Project-era Facilities: Since the closure of the Rocky Flat Plant in 1989, the
    U.S. has had only a limited capability to produce the core component of our stockpile weapons: the
    plutonium pit. To establish a pit production capability, a 60 year-old research laboratory must be
    replaced by the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement (CMRR) nuclear facility at Los
    Alamos. Likewise, producing uranium components at the 70 year-old facility at Y-12 in Oak Ridge is
    an increasing risk that requires construction of a new Uranium Processing Facility (UPF). Completion
    of these new facilities will be essential in meeting life extension program requirements starting in 2020.

•   Production Capacity: As Secretary Gates stated, "Currently, the United States is the only declared
    nuclear power that is neither modernizing its nuclear arsenal nor has the capability to produce a new
    nuclear warhead."8 The United States requires a nuclear weapon production capability with sufficient
    capacity to satisfy the life extension requirement of our aging weapons, as well as to provide a "hedge"
    against future technical or political problems. Currently, we are limited to producing a handful of
    plutonium pits a year for one weapon, but are unprepared to produce most of the remaining pieces of
    that weapon.9 Modernization of the NNSA laboratories and plants is required to correct this issue, with
    the stated goal of establishing a "capability-based" 10 production capacity. Without this capacity, there
    can be no stockpile reductions. In fact, General Chilton argues the stockpile might have to be
    increased: "1 would say because of the lack of a production capacity there's a fear that you might need
    to increase your deployed numbers because of the changing and uncertain strategic environment in the
    future."

•   Life Extension Programs: Under current policy, the laboratories and plants are constrained to
    extending the life of existing warheads to keep them in the stockpile for much longer than originally
    expected. Thus, as the weapons age and concerns are observed, the laboratories and plants determine
    how best to repair the weapons. Aging components are replaced, remanufactured or inspected for reuse
    in the stockpile. In performing life extension for the W87 and the ongoing W76, our experts have
    discovered that it is very difficult to reconstitute processes and capabilities that have been allowed to
    atrophy. Currently, the W76 warhead is in LEP production, the B61 LEP study is underway and the

    NPR called for an FY2011 start to a W78/W88 LEP study that will research if the two warheads can be
    life-extended simultaneously.

•   Surveillance: The average age of our current nuclear weapons is approaching 30 years. To ensure that
    each warhead remains reliable, each year approximately 11 warheads per type should be returned from
    the military for dismantlement and evaluation. Components are inspected and tested to ensure reliable
    operation. This program aids in the annual assessment of the stockpile performed by the laboratories
    and is the lead mechanism for identifying potential stockpile issues. Due to inadequate funding,
    surveillance requirements have not been met for many years, raising concerns about confidence in the
    stockpile.

•   Deferring Maintenance, Creating Chokepoints: In addition to the CMRR and UPF construction
    projects to replace aging facilities, a significant number of buildings in our laboratories and plants have
    been accumulating a backlog of maintenance. This deferred maintenance creates a substantial number
    of facilities that could (and occasionally do) become a choke point in the progress of a life extension
    program. Maintenance can only be deferred for so long, until, eventually, something breaks; and when
    it does break, it is usually much more expensive to replace than routine maintenance would have cost.
    Reducing deferred maintenance is a demonstration that we are moving from a nuclear weapons
    complex in decline, to a revitalized and robust capability.

•   Critical Skills: Perhaps the most significant attribute of a strong deterrent is the scientific and
    technical capability that is present in our laboratories and military complex. Maintaining those skills,
    especially as most nuclear-test experienced weapon designers are past retirement age, is a growing
    challenge within the NNSA laboratories and plants.

•   Hedging: Without a robust production capability, the U.S. maintains a large non-deployed stockpile as
    a technical hedge against stockpile concerns and a political hedge that allows rapid upload should
    another nation become increasingly adversarial. With the technical hedge, if one weapon type were
    discovered to have an urgent issue requiring replacement, alternate components in the force structure
    theoretically could be used to compensate for that loss of capability. For example, W78 warheads on
    Minuteman III might be replaced by W87 warheads maintained in storage, and vice-versa.

•   Delivery Systems: Nuclear weapon delivery systems require replacement within the next thirty years.
    These systems include:

        o The B-52H bomber, first deployed in 1961 and scheduled to be sustained through 2035;

        o The B-2 penetrating bomber, deployed in 1993 is currently being updated for long-term
          sustainment;

        o The Air-Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM), deployed in 1981 and scheduled to be sustained
          through 2030;

        o The Minuteman III ICBM, deployed in 1970, undergoing life extension and scheduled for
          replacement by 2030;

        o And the ballistic missile submarines and missiles. Ohio-class SSBNs were first deployed in
          1981 and commence retirement in 2027. The Trident H Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile
          (SLBM), deployed in 1990, will be sustained through at least 2042, following a life extension.
