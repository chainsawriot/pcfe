ISTANBUL (Reuters) - NATO-member Turkey will make the necessary and appropriate national contribution
to implementing a U.N. no-fly zone over Libya and measures to protect civilians, its foreign ministry said late
on Saturday.

   "Within that framework the necessary preparations and studies are being made by civil and military
authorities in co-ordination," the statement added, giving no further detail.
