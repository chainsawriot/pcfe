Subject:                          Cairo statement



From Jeff:

I reached Lynn Pascoe in Cairo. He saw and fixed the problem. The statement now includes language about Qadhafi
losing his legitimacy, about political/democratic transformation needing to start immediately, about the need for the
process to be inclusive. We'll have to see what the final staetment says, but Lynn sounded confident he has what we
discussed yesterday.
