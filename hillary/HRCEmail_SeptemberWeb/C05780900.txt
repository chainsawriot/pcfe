Subject:                          Random question



One of the members of my Policy Planning staff, Lauren Baer, who works on human rights, democracy and religious
freedom issues, happens to be staying in the same hotel on the same floor as us.
                                        Given the coincidence and the joyous occasion, I was thinking of inviting her to
backbench the morning prebrief, if you're okay with that. Does that work?
