Dear Melanne and Saba,

I've attached the notes from our meeting with Karzai; they may be helpful in preparing for next week.

On the positive side, he committed to including women in any formal negotiations with the Taliban. Hopefully we can
nail that down firmly -- it would be both a good safeguard and a signal to the Taliban of the kind of Afghanistan they will
be joining if they do indeed ever want to join it.

Beyond that, he was in "women's lives first, women's rights second" mode -- speaking passionately about the human
cost of the conflict and the impossibility of Afghanistan enjoying genuine human rights until the fighting ends. He did
this to the point of denying that any real human rights progress had come in his presidency (thus implying that bringing
in Taliban would not make matters worse).

In terms of your messaging, it would be great if, when the Secretary stresses that reconciling insurgents should accept
the Afghan constitution and laws, she specifically mentions the right of girls to go to school and work and take part in
the political process. That would be consistent, I think, with what the administration has said before, but more explicit.
Karzai told us that his government already stresses those specific rights (that's not true -- but it suggests that it would be
hard for them to disagree if the US and international community made it part of their mantra).

It would also, of course, be great if she could find a way to express concern about giving reconciling Taliban leaders who
have a track record of brutality, including attacks on girls schools and killings of women who defy their threats, positions
in local or national government. One can support negotiations even with the worst of the worst of the Taliban, and offer
them other kinds of incentives. But we should draw the line at offering positions of authority over the lives of the
people they have been terrorizing (as the Pakistanis did, disastrously, in Swat).
