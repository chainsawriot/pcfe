Subject: Abbas: 'Peace deal could be signed in 2 months' (Jerusalem Post)

Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said in an interview on Palestinian television that a peace
agreement with Israel could be signed within two months if Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has good
intentions, reported Israel Radio. Abbas said that what is needed is not negotiations, but decisions. He added
that east Jerusalem is occupied land where Palestinians want to establish their capital and this issue was not up
for discussion. The PA president also said that the Palestinians do not plan to unilaterally declare statehood.
