The Secretary broke through the media's disinclination to report on the long-term. I've pasted
in the best example so far (full text further below).

But Clinton stressed that the famine must prompt long-term thinking by governments
and charities to avoid future food crises. Aid shouldn't only be about providing help
during catastrophes, but also about boosting agriculture, nourishment levels and food
distribution networks around the world so that future catastrophes can be avoided.

"While we hurry to deliver life-saving assistance, we must also maintain our focus on the
future by continuing to invest in long-term food security in countries that are susceptible
to drought and food shortages," she said. The basic idea is that teaching people to feed
themselves means less need for emergency—and more expensive—operations later.

Clinton seeks end to East Africa's cycle of famine

WASHINGTON—Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on Thursday described
the severe drought threatening more than 12 million Africans with starvation as
a stark reminder of the need to invest in global agriculture and nutrition—Obama
administration goals that could be sharply limited if House Republicans get their
way.

In a speech at the International Food Policy Research Institute, Clinton
announced that the United States was providing another $17 million in
emergency food aid to the Horn of Africa, with $12 million going to humanitarian
operations in Somalia. That brings total U.S. assistance to the region to more
than $580 million this year.

But Clinton stressed that the famine must prompt long-term thinking by
governments and charities to avoid future food crises. Aid shouldn't only be
about providing help during catastrophes, but also about boosting agriculture,
nourishment levels and food distribution networks around the world so that
future catastrophes can be avoided.

"While we hurry to deliver life-saving assistance, we must also maintain our
focus on the future by continuing to invest in long-term food security in countries
that are susceptible to drought and food shortages," she said. The basic idea is
that teaching people to feed themselves means less need for emergency—and
more expensive—operations later.

Clinton has her work cut out for her at home. Although she never mentioned
Congress, the House Appropriations Committee has proposed steep cuts in
foreign aid funding. Money for the U.S. Agency for International Development,
which pays for much of the government's humanitarian assistance, would fall by
$488 million to $1.04 billion. That would be $705 million below the funding
request made by President Barack Obama.

At a round table discussion with reporters Wednesday, USAID Deputy
Administrator Don Steinberg warned that the proposed cuts would hurt the
agency's ability to improve resilience in the developing world through safety net
and food-for-work programs. Sam Worthington, the president of InterAction, an
umbrella group of U.S. aid organizations, said there was a "disconnect" in
Congress in its discussions about foreign aid and what is happening in the Horn
of Africa.

"We can't watch people starving to death," Worthington said.

The United Nations warned Wednesday the famine hasn't peaked. The long-
running drought has been exacerbated by the Islamic militant group al-Shabab's
refusal to allow many aid groups to deliver supplies in parts of Somalia it
controls. Thousands of children have already died and more than a million
Somalis have fled their homes in search of food.

The crisis is also severely affecting Ethiopia, Kenya and Djibouti, where millions
more need support.

Clinton said the situation could have been even worse had monitors not warned
governrrients ahead of time about escalating drought and crop conditions. The
U.S. was able to pre-position food in key locations last year to prepare for the
likelihood of local shortages. And as a result, less than 5 million need food in

Ethiopia, "an unacceptably high number" but far below the 13 million during the
last drought in 2002-2003, she said.

The biggest problem has been Somalia, which Clinton described as the "epicenter
of the emergency." Unlike its neighbors, the country has no effective national
governance. Insecurity linked to al-Shabab's fighting and previous killings of aid
workers has made operating in the country extremely difficult.

Clinton said the U.S., nevertheless was now providing $92 million in assistance
inside Somalia, and has relaxed anti-terror laws to make it easier for aid groups
to deliver help. Previously, they potentially faced American prosecution if forced
to pay bribes or taxes to al-Shabab, which the U.S. has designated a terrorist
organization.

"But as we proceed, we must not forget that we have seen crises like this
before," Clinton said. "First comes a severe drought. Then crops fail, livestock
perish, food prices soar, thousands of people die from starvation—most of them
children—and thousands more pick up and move. Every few decades, the cycle
repeats."

To break the cycle, Clinton said agricultural systems must be improved so that
they produce enough food and income in good times, and don't completely break
down when nature or economics bring worse times. Infrastructure, better
governance, markets and education are needed, she said.

"A hunger crisis is not an act of God," Clinton said. "We have the know-how, the
tools, the resources and increasingly we have the will to make chronic food
shortages and under-nutrition a memory for the millions worldwide who are now
vulnerable to them."
