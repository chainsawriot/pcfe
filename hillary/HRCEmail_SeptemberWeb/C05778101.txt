Subject: Pakistan says law must take its course in US diplomat case (Reuters)

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan on Saturday said its legal process should be respected after the U.S.
embassy called for the immediate release of an American diplomat who was arrested after he killed two
Pakistanis this week.

The American, identified by Pakistani police as Raymond Davis, told a court on Friday he had acted in self-
defence after fleeing what he said was a robbery attempt in the eastern city of Lahore on Thursday.

Davis has been remanded in police custody for six days for questioning.

"This matter is sub judice in a court of law and the legal process should be respected," a Pakistani foreign office
spokesman said in a statement.
