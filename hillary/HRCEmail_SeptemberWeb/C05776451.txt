Obama More Popular Abroad Than in U.S.; Muslim Disappointment

U.S. Image Strong, Despite Criticism of U.S. Policies




Even as his domestic job approval rating has declined, President Barack Obama remains highly popular in most parts of
the world, and opinions of the United States — which improved markedly in 2009 reflecting global optimism about
Obama — have remained much more positive than they were for much of George W. Bush's tenure.




But America continues to face image challenges in the Muslim world. After edging up slightly in 2009, U.S. favorability
and confidence in Obama have slipped in key predominantly Muslim nations: America's favorability rating in Egypt has
dropped from 27% to 17% -- the lowest figure recorded there in five years. In Turkey, a NATO ally, confidence in Obama
has fallen from 33% to 23%. Opposition to key aspects of U.S. foreign policy remains pervasive and many Muslim publics
continue to view the U.S as a military threat.




Even beyond largely Muslim nations, the survey finds disagreement with Obama's foreign policies. Majorities continue
to see the U.S. as acting unilaterally in world affairs. And global publics give Obama a mixed report card on his handling
of specific problems: About as many countries approve as disapprove of Obama's handling of the situations in
Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq. Of 22 nations surveyed, including the U.S, only in three nations do majorities approve of

Obama's handling of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In Western Europe, while substantial majorities support U.S. anti-
terrorism efforts, nearly 6-in-10 Germans favor withdrawing their troops from Afghanistan, and British and French
publics are evenly split on whether troops should be Withdrawn or kept.




But in a striking difference from the Bush years, these policy disagreements have not significantly dented the U.S. image.
The U.S. favorability rating in Western Europe is overwhelmingly positive, and confidence in Obama to do the right thing
in world affairs remains high: 90% express confidence in Germany, 87% in France, 84% in Britain and 69% in Spain.
Moreover, Obama gets good marks on his handling of two issues of importance to European publics — climate change
and the economic crisis.




More generally, global publics express widespread dissatisfaction about the economy, though they are less gloomy than
in 2009. In 20 of 22 countries, less than half the population expresses satisfaction with their country's direction, and only
in four countries do people say economic conditions are good. Disgruntled publics fault their governments, banks and
then themselves for their economic troubles. In Europe, amid growing economic troubles, there are no signs of a
backlash against the European Union. Large majorities remain supportive of the EU and the euro. But European publics
are divided about the merits of economic integration and differ over the bailing-out of EU member countries.




The new survey by the Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project, conducted among more than 24,000 people in
22 nations April 7 to May 8, provides an in-depth look at attitudes toward major powers and world leaders; the global
economic situation from free trade to financial regulation; Islamic extremism; and international problems such as
climate change. Key findings include:




•     America's Image — U.S. favorability has improved markedly in Russia, China and Japan. It has fallen in India, but
remains high — dipping from 76% in 2009 to 66% in 2010. America's image is highly positive in South Korea (79%
favorable), Poland (74%) and Brazil (62%).




     The Arizona Effect: U.S. favorability in Mexico has tumbled in the wake of Arizona's new immigration law — from
62% in polling conducted before the law's enactment to 44% afterward.




      European Leaders: German Chancellor Angela Merkel is well regarded in Britain and Spain, and gets higher ratings
for her handling of international affairs in France than in Germany itself. French President Nicolas Sarkozy, similarly, gets
better ratings in Germany than in France, but the French leader is less well-regarded in Britain and Spain. Confidence
about Russian President Dmitri Medvedev is on the rise, with ratings up in all five EU member nations surveyed.




•     China on the Rise: A growing portion of global publics sees China, rather than the U.S, as the world's leading
economic power. China itself is the most self-satisfied nation in the survey. Roughly nine-in-ten Chinese are happy with
the direction of the country (87%), its economic conditions (91%), and optimistic about its economic future (87%).

     Islamic Extremism: There is no predominantly Muslim nation polled in which a majority of Muslims endorse suicide
bombing, al Qaeda or Osama bin Laden. But in Nigeria, a significant minority of Muslims express extremist views -- 49%
express a favorable view of al Qaeda.




      Isolationism: Americans are no more isolationist than Europeans. When asked whether their country should deal
with its own problems and let others take care of themselves, nearly half of Americans (46%), Germans (44%) and British
(49%) agree. The French are the most isolationist, with 65% opposing helping other nations cope with their challenges.




      Environment: Substantial majorities in most countries see global climate change as a serious problem, but global
opinion is more divided when it comes to paying increased prices to combat climate change. Willingness to pay higher
prices is nearly universal in China and majorities express support in India, South Korea, Japan, Turkey and Germany.
Views about paying higher prices are mixed in Spain, Britain and Brazil, while majorities express opposition in the U.S.,
France, Russia and many less affluent nations surveyed.




      Iran and Nuclear Weapons: Majorities in nearly every country surveyed, including predominantly Muslim nations,
express opposition to a nuclear-armed Iran. A notable exception is Pakistan, the only nation surveyed in which a
majority (58%) favor Iran's nuclear weapons program. Among global publics who oppose a nuclear-armed Iran,
substantial support exists for applying tougher international economic sanctions against Iran. Less widespread, but still
significant, support exists for considering the use of military force to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.
