  Talked to Jim.

  First, he is Quite worried about the nuclear plant. He just talked to Poneman who said
                                                                                                                  Good news
  from human life perspective is that the radiation is blowing out to sea. He said we're doing all we can, so it's not a
  matter of USG action.

  Second, he said the meeting on Libya will be Monday not today and that he will work to make sure the document
  contains flexibility on the Emiratis and Qataris.
