Subject: UN nuclear agency sends Syria to Security Council (AP)

VIENNA (AP) - The UN nuclear watchdog has recommended that Syria be brought before the UN Security
Council for violating its safeguard agreements, citing Syria's undeclared construction of a nuclear reactor.
   A majority of the voting members of the International Atomic Energy Agency's board of governors June
9 supported the recommendation, which was drawn up by Washington and 12 of its allies.
   The IAEA action is separate from another effort by European nations to have the UN Security Council
condemn the regime of Syrian President Bashar Asad for its deadly crackdown on protesters.
