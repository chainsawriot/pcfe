Subject: North Sudan ruling party says referendum "broadly fair" (Reuters)

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - A senior north Sudanese official said on January 14 the south's independence referendum was
"broadly fair" and his ruling party would accept the likely vote for secession. "We are satisfied with the process and, as
it has been declared by the President al-Bashir, we will respect the outcome of the referendum ... It will most likely be
for secession," Ibrahim Ghandour, from the ruling National Congress Party (NCP) told Reuters in an interview.
