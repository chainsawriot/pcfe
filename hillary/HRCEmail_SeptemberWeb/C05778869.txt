Bruce and I are fine. Thank heavens for blackberries. Helped many of us find each other and with the former finance
minister as our guide, walked to the stadium. We are now on a bus and will soon head to Antarctic Center where US
delegates converging with embassy staff meeting us there. City is a disaster. Walked over many upended streets,
liquified streets, destroyed buildings. One of our number saw a building fall on a woman walking in the street. Many
people trapped. Our bags are at the hotel in the center city and cannot be accessed. Airport not flying regular flights,
only medical evac. We do have ourpassports but don't yet know what comes next. Will keep you posted. Blackberry
almost out of juice. Will keep you posted as best we can.
