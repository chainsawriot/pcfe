Thank you for your patience and fairness durina this lona !Process. I am sorry that I could deliver only



Independent of how the votes turns out, I think we have an interest in food security and the fight
against hunger that extends far beyond UN organizations like the FAO. At the end of the day, the
$58 million budget and the complexity of running an organization of such diverse membership will
limit the FAO's impact. My guess is that we will accomplish a lot more pursuing the course you have
already identified through "Feed the Future," and building coalitions of countries committed to
winning the fight against hunger. As I have said before, I believe that Brazil and South America will
play a key role in this fight. This continent has most of the world's available arable land and
water. Add to this the peaceful nature of South America and the ready availability of sea ports, and
I cannot imagine a better partner. It still lacks the infrastructure, regional policies, and financing
necessary to assert itself as a major player in food security, but I think this is something we can help
fashion.

I look forward to working with you on this.

Regards,
Tom
