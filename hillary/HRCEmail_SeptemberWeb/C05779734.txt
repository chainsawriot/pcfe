Just to report that I passed along to the Foreign Secretary your message about the Secretary being interested in
attending. He thought this excellent news.




Of course all of us here understand that diaries are diaries, and might in the end be decisive. But I was asked to
make this point before we finally settle on the date.

All the best, Geoffrey
