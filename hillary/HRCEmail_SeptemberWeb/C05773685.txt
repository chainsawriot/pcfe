Talked to Kislyak. He has been instructed by Medvedev to convey to the Secretary a quick message following on M's call
                         during which Medvedev promised that he would press for prompt Duma ratification of New
START. The message is simple and positive: the Duma today passed the first reading of the treaty, which is the key step,
and will likely complete the remaining readings and formal ratification in mid-January, right after the Russian holidays.

Kislyak said he knew that it was unusual to request to pass this directly to S, esp on Xmas eve, but he is in a bind
because of direct instruction from Medvedev.

If S has time for 3 min call, it would be a nice gesture, following Senate ratification.


Thanks.
