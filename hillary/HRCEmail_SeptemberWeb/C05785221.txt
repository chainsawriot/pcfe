Up to undersecretary

Foreign Policy's

Josh Rogin, who writes the Cable blog, which regularly appears in this paper, noted that former assistant secretary of
state Wendy Sherman, now with Albright Stonebridge Group, is the leading pick to be undersecretary of state for
political affairs. That job is usually held by a career person, but career officer William Burns, who held it, moved up to be
deputy secretary.

Could be further along than that. We've been hearing that she's been getting a high-speed vet to get her nomination up
to the Senate as quickly as possible. (The pre-August confirmation window is going to start closing soon.)

There's also been chatter that Cheryl Mills, chief of staff to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, may be returning to the
private sector, though a source says, "I'm not seeing any movement from her to suggest she is going anywhere soon."

No one would be surprised, however, given the grueling pace and long hours Mills puts in on the job. In addition to her
already crushing and wide-ranging portfolio, she has taken a personal interest in a number of specific issues, from the
ongoing devastation and political instability in Haiti to unrest in the Persian Gulf states and even the plight of a member
of the American community of Muslim converts in Yemen who was arrested there a while ago.

Then there are the 4-year-old twins at home.

Embassies for sale

Speaking of diplomacy, the Obama campaign is said to be looking to enlarge the number of big-time givers and bundlers
for the 2012 reelection campaign. There should be some former Hillary die-hards who will be much more disposed to
donating this time to Obama — especially if she's working them on his behalf.

That may make up for a likely falloff in smaller donors — especially students — who may not be so forthcoming this time
around.

Looks good on paper, but this will present a real challenge, in part because there are only so many embassies available
for sale. At last count, there were 187 ambassadors to countries and international organizations, and most of those go
to career Foreign Service people. Historically, the percentage available to political backers is around 30 percent, and
there would be a huge uproar from the Foreign Service folks if Obama went much above that number.

It's pretty hard to increase the number of ambassadors, though there are a few countries without them. Most are not
ones some fat-cat contributor would raise $500,000 for. Maybe Havana if both Castros die and democracy blooms, or •
maybe Burma, if the murderous thug regime there collapses. Certainly not North Korea. (A two-state settlement
between the Israelis and Palestinians would open up one new embassy opportunity. )

Given the laws of supply and demand, it's going to cost you a lot more this time for that lovely manse in Madrid.

Exhibiting diplomacy

It's been a long time coming, but it appears the Museum of American Diplomacy and Visitor Center is getting closer to
becoming a reality. Former secretary of state

Madeleine Albright has been promoting the idea since the mid-1990s, and all other secretaries have backed it and
worked to raise private donations for it.

The project, with a total price tag of around $50 million, languished a bit during the

George W. Bush administration, but it's picked up steam of late, with the fundraising effort looking to have half of that
in hand or pledged by the end of this year.

The first phase of the project will be construction of a two-floor, 20,000-square-foot pavilion, which will be an addition
that would connect to the main building near the corner of Virginia Avenue and 21st Street NW. A formal request for
bids went out last week with a price tag of $18 million to $24 million. The various exhibits, interactive displays and such
will be housed there.
