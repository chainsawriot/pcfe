Subject: US civilian engineer found dead in Kabul (Reuters)

KABUL, Sept 6 (Reuters) - A U.S. civilian engineer who worked on a military base in Kabul, was found dead
in the Afghan capital after going missing, an Afghan intelligence source told Reuters on Tuesday, adding that
the man appeared to have been murdered.

  The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force had said late on Monday that a U.S. Department of
Defense civilian employee had died that day in eastern Afghanistan.

  They confirmed on Tuesday that the man had died in Kabul, and was an engineer. They declined further
comment.
