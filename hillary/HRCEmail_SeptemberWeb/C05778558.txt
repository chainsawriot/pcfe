Made it to the DRC and waiting at UN for flight to Bukavu. Takes me back to your trip here! We seem to have a far more
energetic embassy staff here now. .Charge and amb wife going with me to Bukavu and we have Rep. Shakowsky and
bipartisan congressional staff with us. I will give everyone your best and tell everyone how hard we're working to bring
an end to the insanity that they continue to experience here.

                                                                                                         Safe travels.
