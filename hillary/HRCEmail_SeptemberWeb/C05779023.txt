This is from an Egyptian with whom we worked closely over many years. Makes me sad, I wish I knew what to do. I am
going to organize a meeting with some of the key women in the region to see how we can be useful.




 Dear Melanne,
 We have not been in contact for quite a while and much has happened some positive other disquieting and
 worrying develments. I heard                   that Hillary Clinton had warned in her speech for the 8th March for
 Egypt to preserve its gains in women's empowerment. Alas this is not the case. Ten years of                 work is
 down the drain. The ministry has been abolished it is now back under the ministry of Health including the w
 Family and child council . The child marriage law that was raised to 18 is now in process of bring repealed,
                                           FGM is next, etc. All the work which you and i. were so proud of is being
 attaked as a western agenda and our pioneering work in the rights of the child is cpmpromised and now being
 represented by a man who knows nothing          this was Ahmed Aboul Gheit's last contribution before bring -
 ousted don't we know his views and the headche we had with him.
               called me and wants to do something. She is appalled and i don't know whether we should not have
 a conference call which i can arrange to discuss what we can do and how. cf\INI is wonderful with me and i could
 maybe organize a round table or our friend Christianne Ananpour in her program. I also had Emma Bonino and
 all of us are worried sick. As you know the killer of Sadat was released by the authorities his beard is down to his
 knees and as an extreme fudamentalist he is back on the spotlight.cal; me if you can it is my turn to turn to you
 for suggestions! There is now a strong extremist movement and with Japan's disaster there is almost nothing on
 the news of terrible steps occuring elsewhere which will turn the clock back...
 Much love
