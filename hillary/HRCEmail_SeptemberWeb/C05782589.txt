Subject: Turk PM tells Tripoli crowd Syrian oppressors won't survive (Reuters)

TRIPOLI, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday on a visit to Libya that
those who inflict repression on the people of Syria will not survive, stepping up his rhetoric against Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad.

   "You are the ones who showed the whole world that no administration can stand in the way of the might and
will of the people," he told a cheering Libyan crowd in a public square in Tripoli.

   "Do not forget this: Those in Syria who inflict repression on the people will not be able to stand on their
feet," said Erdogan, who is in Libya as part of a tour of Arab countries.
