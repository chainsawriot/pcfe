Subject: Kenya diplomat: Briton killed, wife kidnapped (AP)

NAIROBI (AP) - A Nairobi-based diplomat says armed men have killed a British man and kidnapped his wife
from a beach resort in northern Kenya.
   The diplomat said Sunday that the attackers broke into their accommodation at the resort about 30 miles
(about 50 kilometers) north of the island resort of Lamu, which is off Kenya's coast and near the border with
lawless Somalia. He says they killed the man and kidnapped his wife overnight Saturday. He declined to give
further details.
   He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Attacks on tourists are unusual in Kenya, which is popular for its safari vacations and pristine beaches.
