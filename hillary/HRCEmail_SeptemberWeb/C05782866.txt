Secretary Clinton might want to know that 16 Christian women's organizations (Church Women United, for example)
have joined the 1000 Days Movement. They are asking the women in their networks to pledge to have 1000
conversations about maternal and child nutrition in 1000 days. A "conversation" can include a presentation at church, a
note in the family's Christmas letter, or a blog post. Each conversation is supposed to share what we now know about
how to reduce child malnutrition and urge people to write Congress in support of Feed the Future and 1000 Days.
