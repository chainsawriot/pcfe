Subject: Haitian lawmakers approve new pick for premier (Reuters)



PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Haitian lawmakers approved the nomination of a U.N. development expert to
serve as prime minister Friday, handing President Michel Martelly a tentative victory in his third attempt to
install a new head of government in the earthquake-ravaged Caribbean nation.

   The lower house of parliament unanimously approved Martelly's designation of Garry Conille, 45, a medical
doctor who had served as aide to former U.S. President Bill Clinton in the latter's role as special U.N. Haiti
envoy.

  Conille must still be approved by the Senate. But his approval in the lower house followed the rejection by
Haitian lawmakers in June and August of two previous nominees for premier.
