KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan President Hamid Karzai has ordered a one month delay to the inauguration of
parliament after a special election court asked for more time to look into fraud allegations, his office said on
January 19. Karzai will now inaugurate parliament on February 22, rather than January 23, Karzai's office said
in a statement.
