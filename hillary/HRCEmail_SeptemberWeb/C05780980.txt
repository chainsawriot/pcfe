Subject: In Cairo, Palestinian factions talk unity Cabinet (AP)

CAIRO (AP) - A Palestinian negotiator says unity talks between Hamas and Fatah have broken off until next
week without agreement over a new Palestinian prime minister.
   Fatah negotiator Azzam al-Ahmad says talks will resume in a week. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas
of Fatah and Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal are expected to attend.
   Naming a premier is one of the main disputes.
   Haines officials in the talks said June 14 that the sides agreed that the current Western-backed prime minister,
Salam Fayyad, will leave his post. Al-Ahmad denied that.
   Hamas sees Fayyad as too close to the West. Fatah believes the U.S.-educated economist is the best candidate
to ease concerns that donor money might go to Hamas. Israel, the U.S. and EU label Hamas a terror group.
