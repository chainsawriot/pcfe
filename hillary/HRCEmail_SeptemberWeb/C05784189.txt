Subject: Pakistan army denies U.S. troops were in northwest (Reuters)

May 22 (Reuters) - Pakistan's military has denied a report that U.S. special forces were embedded with
Pakistani troops for intelligence- gathering missions in the northwest of the country.

   The local Dawn newspaper said on May 21 it obtained secret dispatches from WikiLeaks that revealed that
U.S. special forces were deployed with Pakistani troops in joint operations in Pakistan by September of 2009.

  A spokesman from the Pakistani military's media relations department categorically denied the presence of
American troops in North and South Waziristan.

   Waziristan, part of Pakistan's unruly Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), is seen as a global hub
for militants, including al Qaeda and Afghan Taliban factions which cross the border to attack U.S. troops in
Afghanistan.

    "No U.S. troops are involved in any military operations in FATA," said the spokesman.
