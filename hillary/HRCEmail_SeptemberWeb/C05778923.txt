We are still working out the technical details, but you'd be sitting-with an Aljazeera correspondent (Ibrahim who has
interviews you 3 times and was supposed to on Thursday). He would present the Qs to you, either by reading them to
you, or showing you the recorded question on a monitor. We'd do this in the State studio

MS -

To follow up on our conversation the other day about doing something webby related to Egypt, we'd like to on Monday
set up a session where you answer questions that have been culled through new media (youtube, Twitter„ etc). We'd
partner with Aljazeera who would solicit, choose and pose the questions to you.
