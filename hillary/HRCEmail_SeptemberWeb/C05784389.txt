Subject: Muslim Brotherhood calls Syrians to take to streets (Reuters)


AMMAN (Reuters) - Syria's banned Muslim Brotherhood called on Syrians to take to the streets to demand
freedom, a declaration by the movement said on Thursday, ahead of Friday prayers.
   "Do not let the regime besiege your compatriots. Chant with one voice for freedom and dignity. Do not allow
the tyrant to enslave you. God is great," said the declaration, which was sent to Reuters.
   It was the first time that the Brotherhood, whose leadership is in exile, had called directly for demonstrations
in Syria since pro-democracy demonstrations against President Bashar al-Assad's autocratic rule erupted six
weeks ago.
