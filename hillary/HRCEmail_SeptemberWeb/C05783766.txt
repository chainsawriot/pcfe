Subject: Syria uses army to crush revolt; at least 11 dead (AP)


BEIRUT (AP) - An eyewitness says at least 11 people have been killed in the southern Syrian city of Daraa
after the army stormed in before dawn and fired indiscriminately on civilians.
   Syrian troops entered Daraa backed by tank fire and snipers. It was a sharp escalation of the deadly
crackdown by President Bashar Assad's regime against a pro-reform uprising.
   The witness said by telephone from Daraa that he counted at least 11 corpses Monday. Another 14 were lying
in the streets, apparently dead or gravely injured.
   He asked that his name not be used for fear of reprisals.
   Daraa is the city where the uprising began more than a month ago.
