                   The cancellation of Women's Quota without alternative legal
                     methods that guarantee women's political participation
                            is pushing women back to the zero point

While experts are working with the military council to amend the political rights law, news
leaked about canceling allocating women's seats, which are known by "women's quota" and
which is one of the positive type of discrimination in law. Women's quota is not the only type of
positive discrimination. There is another type: the quota of workers and farmers which is 50%
of the elected seats. However, there is not any news on canceling this quota, which raises the
question on the validity of cancelling women's quota.

        Why does the cancellation only refer to women's quota, whereas the principle of positive
        discrimination continues and is not canceled?
         What are the guarantees that may preserve women's political participation just as much
        as they participated effectively in the revolution? This participation has been appreciated
        by leaders through preserving the positive discrimination in article 38 of the constitutional
        declaration, which affirmed that "the law will govern the right of candidacy for the
        People's Assembly and Shura Council according to the determined electoral system,
        including a minimum representation of women in both assemblies."
          What are the pragmatic methods to ensure the equality referred to in article 7 in the
        constitutional declaration: "The Law applies equally to all citizens, and they are equal in
        rights and general duties. They may not be discriminated against due to race, origin,
        language, religion, or creed."

The basic guarantee for achieving this is applying and enforcing these texts and using them in
real life. This matter shows that there is still a wide gap between what has been decided by the
constitution and the laws and their application in real life.

Women's representation in the elected bodies since obtaining the right of political participation
in 1956 differed. But it was generally a marginal representation since its rate fluctuated between
0.5%- 2.4% during 5 decades, beginning with their achieving of political rights and access to
parliament pursuant to the constitution of 1956 till the assembly of 2005. This rate witnessed
an exceptional change in the first half of the 1980s when it increased to 9% (in the assembly of
1979) due to the issuing of the law 12/1979, which stipulated allocating at least 30 seats for
women. Although the issuing of the law 188/1986 cancelled this allocation, women's
representation rate continues to be higher than the general range because they benefit from
the proportional lists of parties.

With the canceling of the proportional lists of parties and the adoption of the individual electoral
system, women have no chance anymore to access the parliament except by competing with
men in unfavourable circumstances.

This matter made many parties, politician and human and women rights leaders call again for
the support of women's representation by the electoral system of lists with a minimum
allocation for women's representation on the lists. The Tagammu party and other political
powers suggested this minimum to be 30%.

But the former regime applied the system of allocating seats with the individual electoral system
by allocating 64 seats for women in the 2010 elections, which now, as leaks say, will be canceled.

Although many political powers and women's organizations affirmed their refusal to the way
with which the quota system was applied, they also affirmed that canceling it without
developing legal methods to ensure women's effective and equal participation may push
women, despite their visible participation in the national fight of the revolution, back to the zero
point, especially within the social and cultural problems from which the Egyptian society suffers
and the appearance of hostile ideological trends towards women's participation after the
revolution.

                           Thus, women's political participation needs:
Adopting an electoral system based on the proportional lists, whereas women's participation
on the proportional lists should not be less than 30% so that women's participation, promotion
of the party life, and strengthening of the parties in addition to the voters' participation in the
political process on the basis of platform can be increased.

This matter needs:

                   i.     Expanding the geographical and population range of the constituency. These
                constituencies should be represented within this electoral system by many members
                not just by one member.
             Electing by the proportional list enables members to be interested not only in the local
             issues of their constituencies, but in the public issues as well. Therefore, this system is
             suitable for the idea that the member should be representative for the whole nation and
             not only for his constituency. This electoral system also helps members to achieve freedom
             and independence from acting within the responsibilities given to them by the voters in
             the individual electoral system.

         Elections by the proportional lists also redouble the voters' rights to participate electing
         more than one member rather than just electing one member. Hence, the citizen feels his
         importance in the group, so that his concern with the public affairs and elections is
         redoubled. This system also reduces the excessive feeling of individuality and strengthens
         the feeling of belonging to parties. Thus, the feeling of belonging to the nation is increased
         by it, which is a goal that deserves the adoption of all methods in order to achieve it.

                   ii.  Inclusion of women candidates' names in an order that ensures that there will
                 be the name of a woman in the first 3 names of candidates; another woman in the
                 second 3 names of candidates in addition to a third name of a woman in the third 4
                 names of candidates. This system is known by (3/3/4).
             Adopting this system on the nomination level ensures the participation of 10% to 15%
             women in the elected assemblies.
             It also contributes to the encouragement of women's participation in the party life, in the
             encouragement of parties to activate women's participation in the party not only on the
             level of women's committees, but also on the level of all committees of the party and its
             organizational levels. In addition, it contributes to training women and qualifies them to
             participate in the elections so that women could be one of the opportunities that could
             qualify parties to gain seats in the assembly.
