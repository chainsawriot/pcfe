Q and K can wait til next week - in part so that we can develop a solid message on 3.0.

Muallim should happen tomorrow. I edited the call sheet to calibrate the message; I've asked Fred to take one more
look.

I got call sheets for Muallem, Quereshi and Kayani. Is there agreement I should do all of them?
