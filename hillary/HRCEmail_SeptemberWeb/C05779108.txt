Subject: Thousands in Pakistan rally against American (AP)

LAHORE (AP) - In a massive protest, hard-line Islamic leaders have warned the Pakistani government against
caving to U.S. pressure and releasing an American official arrested in the shooting deaths of two Pakistanis.
   The party chiefs of Jamaat-e-Islami and Jarniat Ulema Islam spoke alongside other hard-liners Sunday at a
rally of at least 15,000 people in the eastern city of Lahore, where the shootings took place. Many protesters
called for the American official to be hanged.
   The U.S. has said the American acted in self-defense when he shot two armed men who tried to rob him
Thursday. The embassy has said he has diplomatic immunity and has accused Pakistan of illegally detaining
him.
   The Pakistani government has refused to release him and says the courts should decide his fate.
