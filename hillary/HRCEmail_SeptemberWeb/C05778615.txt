Cheryl,

Thanks so much for your gracious and understanding reaction to my situation. I forgot to mention just how much I
appreciate being thought of so highly by you.

The phrase in the QDDR you might want to take a look at is in the Exec Summary, page ii, para 3. It refers to civilian
power (read State) and military power (read Defense) as equal pillars of US "foreign policy" (rather than national
security).

Congrats again on a successful conference. By the way, the WH event was a home run. They treated the group well and
the President was most gracious.

Big hug,

Alex
