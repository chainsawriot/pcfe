 Subject: US envoy: Mubarak has to lead Egypt to transition (AP)

MUNICH (AP) - A U.S. envoy who met President Hosni Mubarak earlier this week says his continued
leadership is "crucial" for now as Egypt heads into a transition to democracy. Frank Wisner was dispatched to
Cairo on Monday. He said Saturday that "we're by no means out of the woods but at least a path is opening"
toward a peaceful transition. He said by video link from New York to a security conference in Munich: "I
believe that President Mubarak's continued leadership is crucial - it's his chance to write his own
legacy." Wisner, a former ambassador to Egypt, says Mubarak now faces the "huge responsibility" of leading
the country into a transition without resorting to force.
