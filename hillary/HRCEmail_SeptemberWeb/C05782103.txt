Hello Cheryl:

I wanted to make you aware of a Kaiser/UNAIDS report that is coming out next week that will discuss donor funding for
HIV. The report shows that donor funding for HIV dropped overall from 2009 to 2010, including funding from the
U.S. The Kaiser report is looking at funding that's been disbursed, not funding that's been committed. While there was
a drop from 2009 to 2010, there were reasons for a slower disbursement, which I describe below. We have been and
remain the world's leading donor of HIV assistance, accounting for approximately 54% of funding, and, as you know,
there has been no slack in U.S. commitment in the battle against global AIDS, and no ongoing programs have been
impacted. U.S. funding for global AIDS was not disbursed as quickly from 2009 to 2010 for two major reasons â€” our
work to create greater country ownership, and our need to comply with certification requirements for the Global
Fund. PEPFAR has been working to develop Partnership Frameworks with our partner countries. Funding for these five-
year HIV strategies is only awarded once negotiations are complete and the documents are signed. These negotiations
took more time than originally anticipated, but we have now ended up with partner countries who are taking an
increased role in managing their HIV epidemics. The funding associated with these is moving quickly now that more
than 20 have been signed. Our 2008 reauthorization further required the U.S. to withhold disbursing some funding to
the Global Fund until certification of information around specific issues (like Global Fund payments to any state
designated by the U.S. as a sponsor of terrorism) is complete. Until certification is complete, funding is withheld. We
are currently working with the Global Fund to ensure we have complete information. My staff is preparing talking points
in case any questions arise about this. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Enjoy the weekend.

Eric
