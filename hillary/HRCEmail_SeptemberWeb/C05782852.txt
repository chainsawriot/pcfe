FYI â€” looking like the judiciary and the executive branches might be on the same page this time
around.

With the grace of God this is about to resolve.

Thanks for everyone's work on this.

 Dear Families,

 Cindy called me to call Shafii. Shafii had contacted her. He said:

 The case has gone to the 36th division of the appellate court. I was there today for a three hour session with
 the Judge(s). And the Judge decided that both Shane and Josh could be released on Bail.

 The amount of the bail is similar to Shane and Josh, 500,000, each. But unlike Sarah's bail, the Judge decided
 that it could also be in the form of a document, assets, a house for example. In Sarah's situation, it was only
 cash that could be posted as Bail.

 I called Ms. Agosti and Cindy. So, I am hoping this can be taken care of today, so I can release the boys from
 prison today. If it doesn't happen by end of day today, it will hit Court closure days, so it will take 2-3 days for
 me to do this.

 I will be waiting for any direction from the Swiss Embassy or the families.

 Ahmadinejad's statements made to the media were related to the information he had about our court session
 today at the 36th division of the Appellate Court.
