Subject: Ex-Peru President Fujimori hospitalized (AP)


LIMA (AP) - The imprisoned ex-president of Peru is being treated in a hospital after suffering a setback in his
health.
   The 71-year-old Alberto Fujimori was taken to a government hospital Thursday and is expected to stay for at
least three days. He underwent his fourth operation in January for lesions in his tongue.
   Fujimori is serving a 25-year sentence for his role in the murders of 25 people and the kidnappings of two
others during his 1990-2000 presidency.
   His daughter, Keiko Fujimori, lost a presidential runoff election Sunday in which the former president's
release was a central issue. The winner, 011anta Humala, has suggested he would consider pardoning the elder
Fujimori for health problems.
