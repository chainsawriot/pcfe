Saudi troops here; UAE and Kuwaiti troops are coming. All the young Shia from the Pearl Roundabout are reportedly
marching on the highway to confront the Saudi armor. We were sent back to the airport to get off the streets, given
vigilantes (protected by police!) and Shia protests on the bridge.

In this atmosphere, I think I'd better stay here and not go to Cairo and Tunis. It's not clear what I can do -- seeing the FM
and CP and Wefaqis later today, assuming we can get around -- but it would be odd indeed for me to fly off tomorrow
morning for Cairo, given the atmosphere.

This is terrible. Each side is acting on its worst instincts. Each side is confirming the other side's stereotypes. There is
likely to be violence
