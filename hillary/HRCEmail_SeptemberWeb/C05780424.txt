Subject: Israeli police clear Jerusalem mosque plaza (Reuters)

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli police on Friday used stun grenades to disperse Palestinian stone-throwers at a
Jerusalem holy site after Muslim prayers and arrested three people, a police spokesman said.

   Officers went to the plaza near al-Aqsa Mosque where they broke up the melee by a few dozen stone-
throwers but they did not enter the mosque, one of Islam's holiest shrines, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld
said.

   He said police left the plaza after about 20 minutes as worshippers made their way home from prayers. No
injuries were reported.

   Tensions ahead of Friday prayers at al-Aqsa mosque are always high but for months no violent incidents
have been registered at the flashpoint holy site.
