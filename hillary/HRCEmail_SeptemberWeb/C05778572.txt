I've been in Bahrain for 40 minutes. It's shocking. We can't get off the airport island because Shia protestors have
closed the three bridges to the main island (using trucks to block bridges, cutting battery wires to make it hard to move
them). Masked Sunni vigilantes on the airport island are stopping all vehicles on the roads, brandishing clubs.
