ATHENS (Reuters) - Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelati Obeidi told Greek Prime Minister George
Papandreou on Sunday that Libya wants to end fighting in the country, Greek officials said.
   "It seems that the Libyan authorities are seeking a solution," Foreign Minister Dimitris Droutsas said after
the envoy met Papandreou. "There needs to be a serious effort for peace and stability in the region."
   A Greek government official told Reuters that Obeidi had said Libya wanted the fighting to end. Obeidi told
Papandreou he will next travel to Malta and Turkey, Droutsas added.
