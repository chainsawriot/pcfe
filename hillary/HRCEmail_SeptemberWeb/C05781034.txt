Thanks so much for your kind words about CAP. I know we've been discussing a CAP speech for a while, and in that vein
I wanted to raise a big conference we're putting on in the fall that I thought you may be interested in. We're going to
do a day and half conference on American Exceptionalism in its many different iterations. Subtly the conference will
highlight the connections between core American ideals and progressive values; frankly, our aim is to capture American
Exceptionalism for progressives, not cede the territory as so many progressives tend to do. Though we promise, it won't
be pedantic.

We'll have a session on American Exceptionalism and Democracy - and how democratic principles in our foreign policy is
a core American value. Given all the changes in the world, we think this focus will be very timely. We'll have another
session on how a strong and robust middle class is a core principle of American Exceptionalism as well.
The conference participants will include many of our donors; we're putting a big focus on bringing in our existing donors
from around the country, in addition to thinkers, reporters, and political types, as part of the audience.

We'd love for you to do a keynote speech, or a significant speech, depending on your time. The optimum day for that is
October 12th. I know getting a date when you're in town will be hard, but again, we'd
be thrilled if you could do this. Please let me know if you have any
questions and if you have any interest.

Thanks so much Hillary and hope you had a restful 4th -

Neera
