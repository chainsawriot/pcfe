Hillary,




I am ready to go. My CDC meetings with Tom Frieden, the head of Global Health and about 20 other colleagues were
excellent. They are very supportive of my arrival and have urged me to come as quickly as possible. I am energized by
this assignment and will also simply look forward to being in the Department to help you in any way I can.




I have finished my paperwork




Matt and I will be at your CAP event on the 15th.




I am in town on the 14th and 15th and available to meet.




I want you to know how much your leadership around Wikileaks has inspired people in the country. It encourages them
to overcome the unexpected challenges they face in ther own lives. And let's hope Richard is alright.




Yours,
