I asked many questions after you raised. Huma said that the Embassy is running point. Jessica reviewed a photo of the
food and made suggestions to bulk it up. Huma and I agreed to quickly send Mark to Paris - who is landing there now
and already connected with embassy people and assist in assuring the food/flowers are appropriate. He has a flowers
person already on it and I believe Huma has the menu - I have not seen it yet. If she does not I will have Mark send so
that you can make any changes you like.

Who is responsible for the dinner I host? I was surprised when you said no one from protocol would be there. Who
selected the menu and who does the seating? As you can tell, I didn't focus on this at all until yesterday.
