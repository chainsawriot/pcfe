Subject: Qatar to take part in military action over Libya (Reuters)


CAIRO (Reuters) - Qatar will participate in military action over Libya with the aim of ending bloodshed there,
Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani told Doha-based Al Jazeera television channel.

   The Arab League had called for a no-fly zone over Libya a week before Western powers backed a U.N.
Security Council resolution that authorised such a zone and "all necessary means" -- code for military action --
to protect civilians.

    "Qatar will participate in military action because we believe there must be Arab states undertaking this
action, because the situation there is intolerable," he told Al Jazeera television channel.

    But the channels said he did not specify what Qatar's precise role would be.
