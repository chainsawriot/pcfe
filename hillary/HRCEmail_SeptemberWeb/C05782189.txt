Subject: Garry Conille

JoeIle just spoke with Kali Jones, who said that MM is going to put forward the name of Garry Conille
as Haiti's next Prime Minister, with the announcement coming out perhaps as early as this
evening. Kali met with members of the Inite/GPR Coalition earlier today, and they agreed to waive
the residency requirement. She said the group was very antagonistic, saying this was being imposed
by the U.S. and Bill Clinton. Post is preparing a cable on all this which should come out tomorrow
morning.

Peter Kujawinski asked Victor Marsh to find out from the UN if a UN employee could take a leave of
absence from a UN post.
