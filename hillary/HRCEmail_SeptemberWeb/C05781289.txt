Subject: Press Coverage of Hong Kong

It looks like S got wide and in-depth press for her remarks in Hong Kong. The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, USA
Today, CNN.com, Foxnews.com, the Washington Post, AP, Reuters, and Bloomberg all gave the speech full-length stories
(at least online).

Virtually all stories emphasized the Secretary's statement of confidence that the U.S. will find a successful resolution to
the current debt crisis, and a number of outlets led with that issue before pivoting to the broader thrust of the
Secretary's remarks. Probably inevitable in light of current headlines.

Coverage generally reflected the values themes in the speech, and noted that S was quite direct on the challenges we
see, from state owned enterprises to intellectual property theft. Press also generally picked up the point that all
countries need to adhere to the principles of a free, open, transparent and fair system. Some, though not all, stories
provided details about our affirmative agenda (APEC, TPP, KOBUS, etc.). The line "We are a resident power in Asia -- not
only a diplomatic or military power, but a resident economic power. And we are here to stay," got wide play.
Interestingly, UPI's story focused on the call for regional integration.

I found some international coverage on Googlenews, but it seems to me that there should be more. Possibly because I
don't really know how to search the international sources.
