Secretary Clinton just finished her APEC speech. I would say it was the definitive speech about women in the global
economy, delivered by someone who so deeply and clearly understands the issues, that it wasn't clear she was using the
teleprompter. It was solid, meaningful, practical, and inspiring, and a call to action for businesses and governments--
including our own--to step up to the plate given the incontrovertible evidence. It was a privilege to be there in person
and to share in her enthusiasm.

It was terrific!
