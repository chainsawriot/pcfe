Subject: Senator Inhofe to defend Gbagbo in public

Cheryl: This is a heads-up:
Senator Inhofe just called my deputy Don Yamamoto this evening to inform us
that:

    1) He had sent a letter to Secretary Clinton recently and was still awaiting a
       response. (Comment: We have not seen the letter in the Africa
       Bureau.)

    2) The Senator will be sending an editorial or article to the Los Angeles
       Times as well as other news outlets tonight.

  3) The Senator's message points are: (a) there is ample evidence of
     irregularities to demonstrate that opposition candidate Ouattara stole the
     presidential election; (b) there should be new elections; (c) the increased
     violence in Cote d'Ivoire is due to OUattara's more violent efforts to
     consolidate his position through force. (Comment: all the evidence
     demonstrates that Ouattara won and Gbagbo lost.)
The Senator concluded by saying that he was giving the Africa Bureau a heads
up as a courtesy.

Comment: Senator. Inhofe has close ties to President Gbagbo, has criticized our
Cote dIvoire policy and has resisted our previous efforts to get him to call
Gbagbo to step aside.

Johnnie
