1. Jordan will send mil experts/advisors soon (by the weekend) to work with/coordinate with NATO.

2. Jordan will get to yes on F16s but we must stay silent for now.
Will sell it on humanitarian mission needs more than military grounds.

3. Jordan willing to join contact group, since that's not military.
Need a high-level ask (ie, my question isn't good enough).

4. Nasser wants to come to DC on 4/11 to see S.
