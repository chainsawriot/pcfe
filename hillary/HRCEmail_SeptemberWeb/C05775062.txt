administration. I realize there are other priorities but the the draft takes that into account. Anything that the Secretary
might be able to do to get this statement issued by the President and sent to the Conference would be much
appreciated. If that looks like too much heavy lifting and I know that is a rare commodity to be used judiciously, anything
she might send herself along these lines would convey a clear and valuable signal and be most appreciated at home and
abroad.(l have attached a conference agenda for your information). Tom Pickering




"I congratulate the Commission on Ocean Law Policy in your meeting to review the record and support the ratification
by the United States of the Law of the Sea Treaty. I am pleased to join with every American President since the treaty
was first submitted to the Senate in 1994, whether Democratic or Republican, all of whom have supported United
States' adherence since the Convention. It is an important goal of this administration to secure Senate advice and
consent to the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea [this year] [as soon as possible]. The convention has the support
of every living Chief of Naval Operations and Commandant of the US Coast Guard, the endorsement of every living
former Secretary of State since the Reagan Administration, the leading business organizations and industry associations
and hundreds of other security experts, practitioners and scholars. By adopting this Convention, America will join 159
other nations plus the European Union in supporting the rule of law in the world's oceans. The Convention strengthens
our security, secures our sovereignty and promotes the sustainable development of our ocean resources Adoption will
facilitate access to offshore resources, enhance naval and air mobility, strengthen homeland security, and restore United
States leadership in ocean affairs."
