Jeff did some digging here is what he found.


He's Druse, from the Chouf town of Bakleen. So he's not a Hizballah guy. Turns out I'm friends with his cousin, who
describes ZT as "a real mafioso." He is apparently one of those Lebanese who lives in the shadows and does arms deals.
He was the go-between between the French and Q, when 0 was buying Mirages. He also was the broker who got the
Pakistanis to purchase French submarine(s).


Google search his name and something interesting comes up: he was detained upon arrival in France from Tripoli on
March 7 (ie, after clashes broke out but before the no-fly zone) with an undeclared 1.5 mil EURO from Q, which he was
allegedly going to use to buy influence for Q.
