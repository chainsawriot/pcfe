Dear Huma,

         Just a short note, if appropriate, for S:

       During a meeting with me earlier this week, Samoa's Prime Minister made it a point to state
that he was moved by the Secretary's public statement regarding Samoan Independence Day. He
can be somewhat taciturn, but he was clearly impressed and pleased with the statement.

        Next year (June 1) will be the country's 50th anniversary of independence.

        I hope all goes well in DC.

        Best regards,
