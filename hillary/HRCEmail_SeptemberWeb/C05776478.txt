I did not. Very aggravating. There is some kind of disconnect. We are still waiting to hear back on mashabane's
availability. Nothing yet scheduled for tomorrow, but we still have menendez and alexander outstanding. Menendez's
staff owes us a call back. Alexander is free up until 1pm tomorrow.

Ok. Is the South African call scheduled yet? Are there any calls outstanding for today or tomorrow?
