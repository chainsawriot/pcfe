   Subject: Mexican police find Cal congressman's 3 grandsons (AP)


   TIJUANA (AP) - Mexican police have found the three grandchildren of a California congressman in the border
   city of Tijuana nearly four years after they were allegedly abducted by their mother.
      Tijuana police say they located the 11-year-old boy and 9-year-old twin boys and arrested Jennifer Dejongh.
   Police identified the mother by her maiden name, Jennifer Lopez. The boys are the grandsons of Republican
   U.S. Rep. Gary Miller.
      Police said in a statement Thursday that FBI and Los Angeles sheriff investigators helped locate Dejongh,
   wanted on a U.S. felony warrant. A U.S. man also was arrested in the Wednesday night operation.
      Dejongh had joint legal custody with Miller's son Brian Miller. But there was an ongoing legal dispute.
