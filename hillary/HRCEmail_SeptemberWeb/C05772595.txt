Subject: Friends of Yemen: who represents Yemen?

To all:

I mentioned this to D(L) today in the Thursday staff meeting, and I'd be grateful to have guidance from the Secretary.
The issue is whether Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh should be invited to the Friends of Yemen meeting in London.
(If it's not Saleh, Yemen's rep would probably be Yemeni Foreign Minister Abubakr Qirby, who will be in Washington
next week.)

The NSC has asked if there is a "State position" on whether to invite Saleh or not. I would be very interested to know
whether S feels strongly one way or another. She will see Qirby here next week, so London would be a chance --
without having to travel to Yemen -- of engaging Saleh directly. We are meeting with the "group of four" (UK, US, UAE,
Saudi Arabia) again tomorrow, so we'd like to get a unified USG, and then hope to get a unified USG-UK position, in
advance of that meeting.

Thanks for any guidance.
