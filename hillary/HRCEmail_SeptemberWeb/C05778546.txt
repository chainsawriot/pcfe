Subject:                           draft of your remarks on Egypt
Attachments:                       Munich speech - Egypt section for HRC.docx; Munich speech - Egypt section for
                                   HRC.docx



Madam Secretary,
Jake suggested that I send you the current draft of the Egypt/ME section from your speech in Munich. (The first half is
on European security, missile defense, etc.)

The idea is to pick up on your message from Doha and flesh out our messages so far on Egypt.

We're still working on some of the language, and may need to dial back in some places. (Of course we'll update it to
reflect events of the coming 24-36 hours too.) D/S Steinberg, Bill Burns, Jeff Feltman, and others are also reviewing it.

See you on the plane tomorrow.

Josh
