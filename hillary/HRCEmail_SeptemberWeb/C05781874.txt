Jake,
As a follow-up to Mike's meeting with the Secretary last week, he drafted the memo below, which is itself a summary of
how far we've come since the memo attached. this doesn't seem to require going through the system, and we'd like
to convey Mike's note to the Secretary before next Friday. If this is not the way to do that, please let me know what
would be better
Deborah G.

Re: Update from previous work plan and planning for the next 18 months

Thanks again for taking the time to meet last week to discuss our priorities for the next 18 months. We are very excited
to be working with you on this important agenda and moving ahead on the issues we discussed. We also look forward to
having you join our off-site meeting at GWU on Friday August 12. We will work around your schedule to make the most
of the time you are with us. That meeting will give everyone in DRL a chance to discuss our policy priorities and what it
will take to get this work done. I know the staff would be delighted to hear your thoughts on how we can help you
advance this agenda.

When we met, I mentioned the memo we prepared for you in September 2009, as I was first coming into the
Department. Looking back at the last 22 months, with your encouragement and involvement, we have achieved a
number of the objectives outlined in that memo:

Your December 2009 speech at Georgetown made the links between human rights, democracy, and development and
outlined what we mean by "sustainable democracy."

We followed through with strong diplomatic efforts and programming to support Internet freedom, following your
Krakow speech on civil society we established the Lifeline Fund supporting embattled NG0s, and we launched a very
active effort to promote workers rights and economic opportunity in the Middle East and elsewhere.

Though we never predicted the dramatic changes in the Middle East, the focus we placed on Egypt in 2010 and the work
we did there put us in a strong position to be a constructive partner with NEA in the first half of this year. Though we
face daunting challenges in Egypt and throughout the region, we are well-positioned to advance a strong human rights
agenda that bolsters U.S. strategic objectives.

Your Internet freedom speeches have put this issue on the global agenda and we put in place programming that was
helping activists on the ground before the Arab spring began. With your support, we have turned the tide on a hostile
narrative in the media, on the Hill and with the BBG. While there are certainly remaining challenges, the continuing
spate of favorable coverage has helped define Internet freedom as an element of sustainable democracy in the minds of
global audiences.

On China, we have tried to create venues for discussion that go beyond the annual human rights dialogue. These include
a revived legal experts dialogue, a proposed religious freedom dialogue, work on labor issues including collective
bargaining and supply chain issues in the manufacturing sector, and participation in the Strategic and Economic
Dialogue.


We also have laid the groundwork for a more active human rights engagement with Russia, participating in two rounds
of the Civil Society working group, in Russia and here. I visited in 2010 and plan another trip this autumn. We are poised
to increase our engagement with Russia in the next 18 months.


We have devoted considerable time and attention to strengthening the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human
Rights and other multi-stakeholder initiatives. These efforts provide a foundation and practical basis for your major
address on business and human rights, which I hope can be scheduled for Davos.
Thanks again for your engagement and support.
