Subject: Robert Ford and 2 other US Embassy Employees Surrounded by Mob in Damascus

Ops just called to report that Ambassador Ford, an embassy political officer, and an embassy DS employee (not the RSO)
were surrounded and chased by a mob in Damascus approximately 15 minutes ago. They have taken shelter in a
building in Damascus, and the RSO is working to move them to a safe location.

There is no information on the size or composition of the mob, and whether they are armed. There are no reports that
any of the employees are injured.

Ambassador Ford does have a cell phone, is in communication with the RSO, and is trying to work on a plan to escape
the mob. His concern right now is said to be that he doesn't want Embassy security personnel to escalate the situation.

Ops will continue to send reports on the situation.
