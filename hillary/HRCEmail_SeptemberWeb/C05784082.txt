I hope you got my longer response to this -- I'll resend. But he definitely meant Schmidt, who was truly brilliant but
whose time in office was too short. Schmidt was part of the team that created the original G-5 as a mechanism for
sensible economic management in a crisis; took vitally important decisions on the Euromissiles in 1982; founded the
European Monetary System (forerunner of the EU); reformed the German Social Democratic Party; laid the foundation
for transforming Germany from a "economic giant, political dwarf" by continuing and really adding substance to Brandt's
Ostpolitik with Russia. Everyone whom I know who has ever worked with Schmidt thinks of him as one of the smartest
strategic thinkers around who is also a pragmatist -- converted visionary ideas to substance under very difficult
situations. Kohl turned out to be a major leader b/c of all the things that happened on his watch -- he made the right
choices re reunification and later European integration -- he was in a direct line from Adenauer's credo of Germany
having to be the anchor of Europe - -the consensus that Merkel appears to be challenging. But Lee Kwan Yew admires
transformative leadership under very tough conditions -- much more Schmidt than Kohl -- and all the more of a
compliment to WJC (although, in my humble opinion, an HRC presidency would be even greater :-)).
Good work in Turkey, though I have been working on an op-ed for the FT arguing that it is time to cut a deal that allows
Saif Gaddafi a role on some kind of transitional council. If that's a really bad idea, let me know, but I honestly think it's
the only way.
Best,
AM

Ps: Andy (the culture vulture) adds that Schmidt played the piano well enough to RECORD a Mozart triple piano concerto
that he played live with an orchestra and two other professional pianists for UNESCO.

I was just thinking about this, did he mean HelmutSchmidt or Kohl!? Because I would have guessed Kohl. But, if he
meant Schmidt, what do you think were his reasons?

I'm in Singapore for a forum on FutureChina and am listening to John Thornton interview to Lee Kwan Yew. Someone
from the audience asked him who the greatest leaders were that he had met in his career, and he answered Deng Xiao
Ping, Helmut Schmidt, and WJC. Nice company!

Congrats on the Mexican truck deal! And making sure the flo/flytilla didn't turn into a disaster.
