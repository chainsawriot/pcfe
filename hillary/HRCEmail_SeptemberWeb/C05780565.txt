Subject: Vital Voices speech

Kay Bailey Hutchinson is also getting an award tomorrow night and she's not referenced in the speech. She's my co-chair
of Vital Voices and is retiring from the Senate. So, one way is to include in 3rd paragraph something simple like" a
member of the US Senate" before the ASSK reference.
