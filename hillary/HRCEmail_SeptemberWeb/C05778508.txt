Subject: Moussa to consider standing for Egyptian presidency (Reuters)

WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa, a popular former Egyptian foreign
minister, said Tuesday he would seriously consider whether to seek the Egyptian presidency.

   "Yes, I have that right. But I will think (about) it seriously in the next few weeks," Moussa said when asked
in an interview with CNN if he would run to replace President Hosni Mubarak in an interview with CNN.

   His remarks came after Mubarak announced he would not seek re-election in September and will spend his
remaining time in office working to address some of the demands that have been made by protesters during a
week of unrest, including amending the constitution to limit presidential terms.

   "I am aware that there are certain currents in Egypt now that would not see this as satisfactory and they
would need more," Moussa said. "I trust that the debate from now on in the next couple of days or so would
center around the point whether this is enough or no, whether we accept it or no."

  "I believe that there is something new that has been offered. It should be considered carefully and the
important thing is the message that the president is not going to continue."
