Following five days of high-level talks in Addis Ababa, the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation
Movement agreed to temporary political and security arrangements for the disputed Abyei Area. Under the terms of the
agreement, which was brokered by the African Union with high-level interventions by Secretary of State Clinton, Special
Envoy for Sudan Princeton Lyman, and others, the armed forces of both sides will withdraw beyond the boundaries of
Abyei and an interim security force composed of one brigade of Ethiopian forces will deploy to Abyei under UN auspices
to provide security, facilitate humanitarian assistance, and protect civilians. The Agreement also establishes an Abyei
Area Administration composed jointly of Ngoc Dinka and Missiriya. The Administrator will be an SPLM nominee, and the
Deputy Administrator will be a GoS nominee. The parties are expected to sign the agreement tomorrow morning, with
Ethiopian forces expected to deploy to Abyei on or about June 25.
