WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed strong support Friday for efforts
to resolve political and safety challenges in Honduras, divided by the aftermath of a coup in 2009.

   Clinton and President Porfirio Lobo spoke by telephone about "political and citizen safety challenges" in
Honduras and her strong support of work by Lobo and the Honduran people to address the challenges, said a
State Department official.

   "Secretary Clinton also conveyed her commitment to seeing Honduras readmitted to the OAS (Organization
of American States) and rejoin the Inter-American community of democratic states," said the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.

   Lobo was elected president following the June 2009 military coup that deposed Manuel Zelaya. There are
reports of increased crime and drug trafficking amid the civic dissension that followed the coup. Zelaya
reportedly plans to return to Honduras in May.
