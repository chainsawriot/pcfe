QUESTION: On Turkey?MR. CROWLEY: Turkey.QUESTION: I asked on Monday about the journalist who got detained. Do
you have anything on that now?MR. CROWLEY: Well, we are watching this case very closely. I don't have a particular
comment other than to say we do have ongoing concerns about trends regarding treatment of journalists within Turkey.
We've raised that with the Turkish Government, and we'll be watching this case very closely.QUESTION: So you have
engaged with Turkish Government so far?MR. CROWLEY: I don't know that we have engaged in this particular case, but
this is an issue that we have raised with Turkey and will continue to do so.QUESTION: U.S. Ambassador in Ankara
Ricciardone gave a couple of statements on the issue — I have the quotes — and there was a quite strong reaction from
Turkish administration saying that nobody should be interfering with the Turkish domestic situation because of
ambassador statement.MR. CROWLEY: Again, obviously, Ambassador Ricciardone — we stand by his statement. But as I
say, we do have broad concerns about trends involving intimidation of journalists in Turkey, and we have raised that
directly with the Turkish Government and we'll continue to do so.QUESTION: You said --QUESTION: Two things real

limits.QUESTION: I'm not sure, too. He said ambassadors have limits. So regarding this subject, regarding Ricciardone's --
MR. CROWLEY: You're saying that Ambassador Ricciardone used the term "limits"?QUESTION: No, no, vice president of
AKP said --MR. CROWLEY: Again, it's not for me to parse the language used by Turkish officials. We stand by the
ambassador's statement.QUESTION: There is some strong arguments in Turkey that the U.S. approach so far to Turkish
Government, strong Turkish Government, kind of appeasement policy to --MR. CROWLEY: What kind of
 policy?QUESTION: Appeasement.MR. CROWLEY: Appeasement?QUESTION: Yes, to Turkish Government. Not — there's
 my newspaper's editorial yesterday, so I'm just (inaudible) message what would be your --MR. CROWLEY: It's hard for
 me to put that in context. Turkey is an ally and friend of the United States. But as we've made clear, anytime that we
think that a friend or ally or adversary has crossed a line and — in terms of respect for universal principles, we will not
 hesitate to raise our voice
