Talked to Kislyak. He has been instructed by Medvedev to convey to the Secretary a quick message following on M's call
                         during which Medvedev promised that he would press for prompt Duma ratification of New

START. The message is simple and positive: the Duma today passed the first reading of the treaty, which is the key step,
and will likely complete the remaining readings and formal ratification in mid-January, right after the Russian holidays.

Kislyak said he knew that it was unusual to request to pass this directly to S, esp on Xmas eve, but he is in a bind because
of direct instruction from Medvedev.

Ifs has time for 3 min call, it would be a nice gesture, following Senate ratification. If not, I'll explain to K. This is in nice
to do, but not essential, category.

Thanks.

Ambassador Kislyak said he has an urgent message to pass to the Secretary. He is available now through the rest of the
day.
