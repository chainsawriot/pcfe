 Subject: Apples Final Update

â€¢ The Embassy of Japan tells me that the Secretary's cover note, along with a picture of the apples,
  has already been received by Foreign Minister Matsumoto. However, Minister Matsumoto decided
  that he would give the apples to the Embassy staff in Washington, so they have not been sent on to
  Japan. My colleague at the Japanese Embassy thought that the Foreign Minister would probably
  make some mention of the apples during his meeting with the Secretary on July 23rd. There has
  already been some press coverage in Japan of the Secretary's gift.
