Subject: UPDATE: OAS says Haiti's government candidate should miss runoff

PORT-AU-PRINCE (AP) - International monitors are recommending that the government-backed candidate in
Haiti's presidential election should be removed from the ballot in the upcoming runoff vote. A draft report by
the Organization of American States monitoring team calls for eliminating candidate Jude Celesitin because of
evidence of improper balloting. The OAS presents the report January 10 to President Rene Preval. The report
has not been released publicly. The Associated Press obtained a copy on condition of anonymity. A foreign
official familiar with the mission's activities confirms its conclusions. The report recommends that third-place
finisher Michel Martelly move up to second to face former first lady Mirlande Manigat.
