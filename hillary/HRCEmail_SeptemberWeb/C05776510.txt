She was on the letter and then pulled her name off yesterday afternoon. Bill Burns is checking with her as to what
happened.

One other point forgot to mention below, we have begun the process for reviewing potential Republican amendments.
Right now there are about 16 floating around that we have seen, and are beginning to mark-up. Also, McCain keeps
telling Kerry he needs a POTUS letter on missile defense amending our unilateral statement, and again rejecting the
Russian unilateral statement. We are trying to work through that now.
