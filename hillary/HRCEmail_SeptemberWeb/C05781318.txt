Subject: RE: HOA

Jake, I'm headed out to do an SFRC brief on El Salvador PFG--here's the short answer we have so far, and we are waiting
on additional inputs, including Ambassador Booth's, who'd like to weigh in but returns from travel today:

Re whether foreign-owned farms in Ethiopia are doing just as badly as the rest of the afflicted region:

--Foreign-owned farms are largely unaffected by the drought, because (a) they are not located in drought-affected
areas; and (b) they have access to irrigation systems.

Re use of drought-resistant seeds:

--drought resistant seeds have not been used on much of a scale, given that commercial farms do not operate in
drought-affected areas

Post points out the most affected populations are pastoralists (herders) in drought-affected regions, not farmers. The
impact on livelihoods has been on livestock, not crops. There are some agro-pastoralists in some drought-affected
areas, operating where there are year-round river systems for irrigation.

We have asked post for more detailed information about farmers in drought-affected areas, what kinds of farming
practices/inputs (such as using drought-resistant seeds) help reduce impacts on drought -affected farmers, and whether
we have any comparables from the current situation that illustrate how different farming practices contributed to
differential impacts.
