Subject: Egypt considering release of suspected Israeli spy (AP)


CAIRO (AP) - Egyptian state media say authorities are considering the release of a suspected Israeli spy held
since June.
   Ilan Grapel was arrested in Cairo on June 12 and has been held without charge. The 27-year-old was born in
the United States.
   Egypt has accused him of being a Mossad agent. Israel denies Grapel is a spy, saying he was working for a
Cairo legal aid project when he was arrested.
   The state news agency MENA says the U.S. consul general and Grapel's parents visited him in detention
Saturday. The agency reported that his parents said he was ill and appealed for his release.
   The report said Egypt's government is "responding to these demands for the sake of prosperity and more
political and economic support" for Egypt. The agency did not elaborate.
