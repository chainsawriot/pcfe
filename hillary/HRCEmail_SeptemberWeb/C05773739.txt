All is quiet here. Iraqis have done a great job at least so far covering the masses and churches. I
went to a mass in Eastern Baghdad, Nuncio and Catholic Archishop of Baghdad 'presiding.' Church
was about 2/3 full. Homily directly targeted the terrorist threats, pleaded for understanding, and
hope for a change.

The Iraqi security at the site itself was extraordinary. (Security at a Christian hospital I visited yesterday
less so, but there certainly was security provided by police.) More generally, streets were about as
deserted as on Christmas day in the Irish-Italian neighborhoods north of Boston. Some of this is
traditional Iraqis also 'celebrating' Christmas, but some of it was the extraordinary 'Iockdown' which
the security forces had in those parts of the city I saw. Jim J
