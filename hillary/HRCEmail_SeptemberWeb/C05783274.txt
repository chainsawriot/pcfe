Subject: Palestine statehood bid in three parts (AP)



UNITED NATIONS (AP) - A senior Palestinian official says the Palestinian application for full membership in
the United Nations encompasses three parts, including a letter to the U.N. secretary-general requesting that the
application be sent immediately to the Security Council and the General Assembly.
   The statehood bid is to be submitted Friday by President Mahmoud Abbas, despite vows by the United States
that it would veto the effort in the Security Council.
   The official said aside form the official application and a pledge to uphold the U.N. charter, Abbas'
submission will include a letter to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon asking that he forward the bid directly to
both assemblies and that the application is based on two pivotal resolutions often cited in the Israeli-Palestinian
dispute that deal with the partition of Palestine and the pre-1967 Mideast war borders.
   The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
