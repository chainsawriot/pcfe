Subject:                          loved your speech tonight, truly



I have been singing exactly the same tune as below in every speech I give, but your speech tonight was particularly
eloquent.

In the 21st century, the material conditions of people's lives have greater impact on national stability and
security than ever before. The balance of power is no longer measured by counting tanks and missiles
alone. Now strategists must factor in the growing influence of citizens themselves -- connected, organized
and frustrated.

There was a time when those of us who championed civil society, worked with marginalized minorities and
women, and focused on young people and technology, were told our concerns were noble but not
urgent. That is another false narrative that has been washed away. These issues — among others — are
also at the heart of smart power — and they must be at the center of any discussion attempting to answer
the region's most pressing questions.

Best,
AM
