Subject: Gaddafi thinks he can win back power - former ally (Reuters)


CAIRO (Reuters) - Libya's fugitive leader Muammar Gaddafi thinks he can return to power when NATO ends
its air campaign, his former right-hand man told Al Jazeera television.

    "Gaddafi is delusional because he thinks he can disappear in Libya and, when NATO leaves, he believes he
can gather his supporters," said Abdel Salam Jalloud, who defected to Libya's rebels before they overran most
of the capital on Tuesday.

  Jalloud, who was speaking in an excerpt from an interview to be aired on the satellite news channel, was a
member of the junta that staged the 1969 coup that brought Gaddafi to power.

    He is believed to have fallen out of favour with the veteran leader several years ago.

    Jalloud said he thought Gaddafi was still in Tripoli.

   "The rebels must open the roads. After they open the roads, he may dress in woman's clothes and leave
Tripoli for the Algerian border or Chad. He is drunk with power," he said.
