Subject: Clashes resume in Yemen after 26 protesters killed (Reuters)

SANAA (Reuters) - Government forces and fighters backing protesters seeking President Ali Abdullah Saleh's
ouster clashed anew with rocket and machine gun fire in the Yemeni capital Sanaa on Monday a day after 26
demonstrators were shot dead.

   Sunday's violence, jolting an uneasy, weeks-long stalemate, was the worst in recent months. Hundreds of
people in an anti-government march were wounded as well when security forces fired on protesters who
charged police lines.

   Opposition organisers called for more action on Monday, rousing sleeping protesters who have been camped
in Sanaa's Change Square for eight months to demand an end to 33 years of autocratic Saleh rule in
impoverished Yemen.
