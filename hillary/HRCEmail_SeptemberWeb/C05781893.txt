                    0                         Tunisia: Analyzing the Dawn of
                                              the Arab Spring

                                              The latest brief from Abu Dhabi Gallup Center
                                              examines public perceptions leading up to the first
                                              regional uprising. Against the backdrop of a rising
                                              GDP, Tunisian life evaluation plummeted, setting the
                                              first sparks of the Arab Spring.

                          View Brief          The research considers Tunisian's life evaluation, the
                                              impact of GDP, vanishing prospects for employment,
                                              and satisfaction with basic needs and infrastructure.
                                              The brief concludes with recommendations to
                                              Development, Trade, and Finance leaders investing in
                                              Tunisia's future.
