    Palau's Voting Coincidences in the 64th United Nations General Assembly (2009)


    Each year, the United States publishes "Voting Practices in the United Nations." This publication reviews
    the voting practices of the Member States for the prior calendar year and evaluates the responsiveness of
    those governments to US policy on issues at the United Nations. Emphasis is places on issues of special
    importance.

    The most recent version, "Voting Practices in the United Nations 2009" was published by the Department
    of State on 31 March 2010.1 The report shows that Palau's percentage of voting coincidence with the
    United States in 2009 on 12 important issues was 100%. This is the highest voting coincidence of any
    country and indicates that Palau is the best friend of the United States at the United Nations.


    Part I. Voting coincidence with the US in the 64th UNGA

    For the 64th UN General Assembly in 2009, the United States identified 12 resolutions as important votes,
    based primarily on their consistency with the State Department's Strategic Goals.

    The table that follows summarizes the performance of five countries, which have highest voting
    coincidence with the United States at the 64th UNGA on the 12 important votes. Palau is the only country in
    the world to cast its votes exactly the same way as the United States for all the twelve resolutions.

                        Twelve                                                       Note

     Part II. Important votes: the resolutions are listed in clusters

                  A. Cuban Embargo Resolution

                  A/RES/64/6 U.S. Embargo of Cuba 187-3(US)-2

                  Text: Called on all states to refrain from promulgating and applying laws and measures such as the
                  "Helms-Burton Act," whose extraterritorial provisions affect the sovereignty of other states, the
                  legitimate interests of entities or persons under their jurisdiction and the freedom of trade and
                  navigation; urged states to repeal such laws.

                  Position: For eighteenth consecutive year, the General Assembly adopted this resolution to call for
                  an end to the United States economic and trade embargo against Cuba. When the General
                  Assembly overwhelmingly condemned the American trade embargo, Palau was the only country,
                  besides Israel, to stand with the United States. The Marshall Islands and FSM abstained.

             B.   Israel Related Resolution

             In this cluster, the resolutions are introduced and supported by Arab countries to promulgate a
             one-sided view of Israeli-Palestinian issues. The United States actively lobbies to vote against
             those resolutions, which are bias against Israel. Palau does not believe those resolutions
             contribute constructively to efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, thus, voted against
             them with the United States.

            A/RES/64/16 Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People
            109-8(US)-55

            Text: Requested the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian people
            to continue to exert all efforts to promote the realization of the inalienable rights of the
            Palestinian people and to support the Middle East peace process.

            A/RES/64/17 Division for Palestinian Rights.of the Secretariat 112-9(US)-54

            Text: Requested the Secretary General to continue to provide the Division with the necessary
            resources and to ensure that it continued to carry out its program of work as detailed in other
            relevant earlier resolutions.

            A/RES/64/91 Work of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human
            Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories 92-9(US)-74

            Text: Demanded that Israel, the occupying power, cooperate with the Special Committee in
            implementing its mandate; expressed grave concern about the critical situation in the Occupied
            Palestinian Territory; and requested the Special Committee to continue to investigate Israeli
            practices.

            A/RES/64/148 Global Efforts for the Total Elimination of Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia
            and Related Intolerance and the Comprehensive Implementation of and Follow-up to the Durban
            Declaration and Program of Action 128-13(US)-43

            Text: Called on states to formulate plans of action to combat racism and related intolerance; and
            decided that the Durban Review Conference's outcome should be undertaken in the same
            framework as the outcome of the 2001 World Conference.



            C.    Nuclear Weapon and Non-proliferation

            The new U.S. administration plans to seek U.S. Senate ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban
            Treaty. Therefore, the United States continue its effort toward the ultimate aim of a world without
            nuclear weapons in supporting these two resolutions to strengthen the global nonproliferation
            regime. These resolutions gained extensive supports from the Member States.

            A/RES/64/47 Renewed Determinations Towards the total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons
            171(US)-2-8

            Text: Called for the immediate commencement of negotiations on a fissile materials cut-off treaty
            at the 2010 session of the Conference on Disarmament and its early conclusion; called upon all

           states to redouble efforts to prevent and curb the proliferation of nuclear arid other weapons of
           mass destruction and their means of delivery.

           A/RES/64/69 Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty 175(US)-1-3

           Text: Stressed that a universal and effectively verifiable Treaty constituted a fundamental
           instrument in the field of nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation; stressed the vital importance
           and urgency of signature and ratification, without delay and without conditions, to achieve the
           earliest entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty.

           D.   Human Rights Country-specific resolution

           In the 64th General Assembly, there are three countries to be single out, namely DPRK, Iran and
           Myanmar, for its grave violation of human rights. These votes are mostly very contentious due to
           its sensitivity. The United States lobbied actively for these resolutions. It is the U.S. belief that
           countries should take responsibility of their wrongdoing, and the resolutions keep world pressure
           and attention on the regimes that disregards the basic rights and universal freedom of people.



           A/RES/64/175 Situation of Human Rights in the DPRK 99(US)-20-63

           Text: Expressed serious concern over the human rights situation in the D.P.R.K., the desire to hold
           the government accountable for its human rights violations, and to improve the situation of
           human rights in the D.P.R.K.

           A/RES/64/176 Situation of Human Rights in Iran 74(US)-49-59

           Text: Expressed deep concern over the deteriorating human rights situation in Iran and the
           government's failure to uphold its obligations under its own constitution and international human
           rights law.

            A/RES/64/238 Situation of Human Rights in Myanmar 86(US)-23-39

            Text: Strongly condemned the systematic violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms of
            the people of Myanmar (Burma); urged the government to release all prisoners of conscience
            without delay or conditions and with full restoration of their political rights, and to ensure
            necessary steps be taken toward a free, fair, transparent and inclusive electoral process.



            E. Other

            A/RES/64/156 Combating Defamation of Religions 80-61(US)-42

            Text: Emphasized that freedom of expression carries special responsibilities, and might be subject
            to limitations as provided by law, and which are necessary for respecting the rights of others and
            protecting national security or public order, health or morals.

            Position: Over the past decade, members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference have been
            working through the UN system to introduce the problematic concept of "defamation of
            religions." It is not agreeable that prohibiting speech is the way to promote tolerance. Therefore,
            United States, with Palau's supports, has consistently voted against this resolution. The United
            States advocates its position extensively through out the years. As a result, the number in support
            of the resolution is decreasing steadily every year.

            A/RES/64/197 Agricultural Technology for Development 146(US)-1-32

            Text: Called on member states and relevant UN organizations to make greater efforts to develop
            and disseminate sustainable agricultural technologies and to support national efforts to make use
            of local expertise and agricultural technologies.

            Position: This resolution is the effort of the Israeli engagement in the United Nations and it has
            received extensive support from the Member States. However, in spite of the apolitical nature of
            the text, Somalia still called for a vote on the resolution for the Arab or Islamic counties to either
            abstain or to be absent on the vote.
