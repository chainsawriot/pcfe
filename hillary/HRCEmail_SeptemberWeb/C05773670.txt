Agreed. Also a huge thanks to Bill Fitzgerald and AF for giving us a quick greenlight and mobilizing an overnight
demarche that brought the African Group to, for the first time ever, lead and initiate a Special Session of the HRC on a
human rights issue on the continent: that is a big step. And to you, Eileen, for being fully committed to getting this
done and making the critical calls to set it in motion. We can only hope this has some small influence in preventing the
unfolding disaster.

2010 goes out with a bang - - here's to building on this foundation to go upwards and onwards in 2011!

Suzanne

Subject: HRC SS CDI-outcome

HRC Team-
Today's SS on CDI is a "landmark victory" for the good guys. This is not just media talk---- Our REAL hope is the reporting
mechanism will translate into impact on the ground and that SS will have "preventative" effect- ie notice that there will
be accountability for HRts abuses.
Getting the Council to act in real time on a real HRts crisis is a big deal for the institution. Before anyone rolls their eyes
and says- "institution" is not important concern the only way the HRC can have ANY effect on HRTs is if it is a credible
institution and develops mechanisms that have impact. This SS may not make "the difference" in CDI this time- but it
will be important for "muscle memory" - and is a big big bolder in the foundation for a UN HRts institution that will have
the ability to make a difference on the ground going forward. Our job is to build that institution. You have certainly
made your mark for the good guys on this one: SA, Brazil, Norway and Mexico have all conveyed awe and thanks to US
team for getting this done.
Two people in particular- to whom I, at least, am indebted on this one: Mark Cassayre- the work horse and negotiator
supreme and Amb. Betty King- our lobbyist in chief and stellar spokesperson. This is a huge accomplishment! You
deserve a holiday!
