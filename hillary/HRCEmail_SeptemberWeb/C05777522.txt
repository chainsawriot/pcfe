Subject: Lebanese leader heads to Paris (AP)

WASHINGTON (AP) - A Lebanese government official said Lebanon's prime minister is heading to France for
consultations on his government's collapse. Prime Minister Hariri met with President Obama. The official said
Obama offered U.S. support. Hariri made no public comment after meeting Obama. The Lebanese official said
Hariri was traveling to Paris to meet President Sarkozy before returning to Beirut. The official discussed the
matter on condition of anonymity due to security and diplomatic concerns. Lebanon's year-old unity
government collapsed after Hezbollah ministers and their allies resigned over tensions stemming from a UN-
backed tribunal investigating the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, father of the current
prime minister. Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran and Syria, has denounced the tribunal.
