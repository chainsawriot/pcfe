  Subject: Fw: Update 3: Former Governor Richardson Meets With MFA Officials (SBU)

 VFM Dagoberto Rodriguez called Julissa Reynoso tonight, saying the Cuban government was offended by Richardson's
 public language on Gross as a hostage and characterization of GOC, and thus would not let him see Gross or discuss
 issue further. They said they had been "very encouraged" by the list of subjects for potential discussion Richardson had
 outlined and couldnt understand why he had been so negative publicly. Rodriguez asked if Richardson had USG backing
 for remaining in Cuba.
 Julissa stressed repeatedly that Richardson was a private citizen and we did not control or "back" him.

 llist Richardson conveyed was same as we've said on table for more than a year.
 2. The Cubans reached out to Richardson, decided they didn't like what they heard and thus are stiffing him.
 3. And are then annoyed they can't control him and want us to do it.

 Julissa or Peter will close loop w/Richardson about Rodriguez call, Richardson waiting to hear back from Cardinal. I doubt
 more will come of this, and I do not believe there is more to be done in this channel. Roberta.

 Subject: Update 3: Former Governor Richardson Meets With MFA Officias (SBU)

 (SBU) The Office of Cuban Affairs reports Governor Richardson met with Cuban MFA officials the evening of
 September 10. An official read a note to Gov. Richardson, conveying the Cuban government did not appreciate
 Gov. Richardson's public comments describing Alan Gross as a hostage, adding this was the reason why he was
 not permitted to see Gross. In addition, the note said Richardson had no further role to play in Cuba.

  (SBU) Richardson met earlier September 10 with Cardinal Jamie Ortega, who expressed frustration the Obama
  administration had not improved relations with the Cuban government as promised. However, the Cardinal
  promised to reach out immediately to a close contact of President Raul Castro, who could facilitate a meeting
  between the President and Gov. Richardson.
  The Cardinal also said he would raise a possible meeting with Mr. Gross.

  (SBU) The Office of Cuban Affairs reports Richardson remains willing to stay in Havana to see how these
  events play out.
