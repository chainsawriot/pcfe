Subject: (SBU) Hossam Zaki on P trip

(SBU) Following up Margaret's meeting with Egyptian FM Aboul-Gheit, I called Hossam Zaki (per the
Secretary's request) to ask again about Bill Burn's potential travel. Hossam said that it is a "solid no." No
reason for S to push, no reason for VPOTUS to call Soliman, no reason to ask again right now. He was full of
compliments for Bill Burns and assured me that Bill would be welcome at another time, "maybe ten days or
so." But not now, "no way." His reasons were varied but mirrored those provided by Aboul-Gheit to
Margaret. He also noted that Egypt has turned down Ashton and a number of Europeans. I noted that we
have had inquiries from Congress about travel, and he said that Congressional travel would also not be
welcome now.
