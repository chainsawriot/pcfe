Then you need to tell                            that concerns have been raised, since, based on           report to me,   B5
I told     it was ok w me to proceed.                                                                                      B6

I haven't called        yet. Spoke to       and am waiting to speak to           who has been in the air all day.          B5
has serious misgivings about         based on conversations he had when            name surfaced for jobs in the           B6
transition. I'm doing some more recon and will get back to you.
