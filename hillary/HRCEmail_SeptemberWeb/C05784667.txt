Subject: Pakistan arrests finance ministry employee on militant links (Reuters)


ISLAMABAD, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Pakistani authorities have arrested an employee of the finance ministry on
suspicion of links to militant groups, police said on Wednesday.

   The suspect, identified as Sardar Ali Khattak, was on a hilltop near President Asif Ali Zardari's residence in
Islamabad when apprehended.

   "He is being interrogated. He was wanted in connection with a bomb blast in Rawalpindi a few months ago,"
police official Hakim Khan said, referring to the garrison city adjoining Islamabad.

    Police raided Khattalc's house last week and recovered a suicide vest and other explosives, police said.

   Finance Ministry officials said Khattalc was an office boy and had been on leave for the past two years, and
that they had no knowledge about his alleged links to any militant group.

    Pakistan has seen a surge in violence by militants loyal to al Qaeda and Taliban since Osama bin Laden was
killed by U.S. special forces in a secret raid in a Pakistani town in May. Militants have vowed revenge for bin
Laden's death.
