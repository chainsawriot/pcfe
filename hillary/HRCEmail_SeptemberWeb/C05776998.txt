If you didn't get a chance to go over the background rachel did, here it is again on START:




"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God."

Matthew 5:9

"And he will destroy on this mountain
the shroud that is cast over all peoples,
the sheet that is spread over all nations."

Isaiah 25:7

There is a shroud over all peoples, a sheet over all nations. It is the threat of nuclear weapons. Though the Cold War
has ended, we continue to live in the Nuclear Age and the specter of nuclear war is more imminent that ever. That is
why prominent religious and national security leaders <http://twofuturesproject.oreendorsements> are joining forces
to speak out for a world free of this threat. This not a new movement. Every American President since Eishenhower,
including Ronald Regan, has sought the global elimination of nuclear weapons. Today, leading voices joining this call
include former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and George Shultz, former Secretary of Defense William Perry, and

Senator Sam Nunn. Speaking from their years of experience defending this country, they know that America can never
be safe in a world where nuclear weapons exist.

What is new is the fierce urgency of now, and the moral resources we are drawing upon to meet this challenge. An
unprecedented number of religious leaders from across the ideological spectrum are coming forward to address the
biblical, theological, and ethical considerations for a world in which the mass destruction of life and creation can be
caused by the push of a button. In our nuclear arsenals, humanity has built a modern tower of Babel and attempted
make ourselves gods by assuming awesome power over life and death. We must tear it down.

The need to rid the world of nuclear weapons is

A moral obligation. In a fallen world, people of faith wrestle with their call to be peacemakers and the difficult question
of whether it is ever justifiable to use force to confront violence and evil. The existence of nuclear weapons stands
wholly apart from this tension. The level of destruction that can be wrought by a single bomb - the loss of life, the
devastation to creation, the political and economic repercussions - is of a magnitude that could never be desired by God.
Furthermore, the argument that we must possess the bomb to deter others from using it reflects a dangerous naivete
toward human nature. Human beings are fallible and the existence of any nuclear weapons makes it a near certainty
that they will be used, whether by accident, those bent on evil, or in vengeance and retaliation.

A national security imperative. Whereas once many argued that the possession of nuclear weapons was the only way to
ensure America's security, now our nation's leading national security advisers agree that the world is too dangerous for
them to exist. We no longer live in a world where two nuclear powers are locked in the stalemate of their mutually
assured destruction. There are an estimated 22,000 nuclear warheads in the world, controlled by 9 nations including
North Korea, China, Pakistan, and India. The risk that other nations, such as Iran, will join these ranks grows everyday.
The complex international politics and hostilities among so many governments dramatically increases the likelihood that
one will eventually be provoked into deploying their nuclear arsenals. Furthermore, the prevalence of these weapons
makes it easier for them to fall into the hands of terrorists who, unlike many nations, seek to possess a nuclear weapon
for the express purpose of using it. The only way to protect America from the use of the bomb is to eliminate the bomb
altogether.

Our only hope. When Robert Oppenheimer witnessed the detonation of the first atomic bomb, he recited from the
Bhagavad Gita, "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds." As long as nuclear weapons exist, the world hangs
under the certainty of vast devastation. We stand on a precipice of our own destruction and our only choice is to retreat
or fall into the abyss. The good news is we have met similar challenges bef6re. We have successfully rid the world of
chemical and biological weapons. Now we must do the same with nuclear weapons.
