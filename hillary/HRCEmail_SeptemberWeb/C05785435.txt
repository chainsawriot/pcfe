Subject:                           Greetings from PNG!



Your spirit pervades our summit here. There have been many references to your November visit, the video was
vigorously applauded, and it's clear to all that you're the major influence behind US renewed engagement in the Pacific
Islands. One of the women delegates even mentioned in her remarks hearing you in Beijing and said your speech
changed her life and so many others.

The delegation is so impressive - from 12 island countries (and NZ, Australia and US). It boggles my mind that this
treasure of talent and leadership is so marginalized by their governments.
As you know, the challenges here are huge but the women are determined to change things and our investment and
collaboration will help.

I spent the weekend in Indonesia where we had an intensive schedule (even Scot Marciel said he learned a lot).There
are great expectations for your visit to Bali.
where you will participate in ASCEAN. There will also be the regional entrepreneurship summit in Bali at same time --
(follow-up to the WH event). There is every hope you will keynote it and we are trying bring deliverables to the event. It
hs great potential in the region.

I noticed that you're meeting with the New Beginnings folks tomw. I was supposed to speak to their event but I'm here.
In my view they're not doing anywhere near what they could do and they need to put more emphasis on women's
economic participation as we'll.

Keep going!
