Subject: Serb war crimes suspect gives no plea to UN court (Reuters)

THE  HAGUE (Reuters) - Croatian Serb wartime leader Goran Hadzic declined to enter a plea to war crimes
charges over the 1991-95 Croatian conflict in his first appearance at the UN's Yugoslavia tribunal July
25. Hadzic, 52, was arrested in Serbia last week and transferred to The Hague -- the last of Serbia's major war
crimes suspects sought by the United Nations war crimes tribunal after the arrest in May of wartime Serb
General Ratko Mladic.
