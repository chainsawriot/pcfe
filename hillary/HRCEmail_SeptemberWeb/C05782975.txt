Subject: UK defense minister quits (AP)

   LONDON - (AP) Britain's defense minister says he has quit his post amid an inquiry into his close friend's
access to meetings and ministry buildings.
  Defense Secretary Liam Fox had acknowledged he allowed former roommate and best man Adam Werritty,
who previously ran a now-defunct defense consultancy, to join him on 18 overseas trips and to arrange a
meeting in Dubai with a potential supplier.
  Fox's office said on Friday that he had resigned his post after days of distracting headlines about the extent of
Werritty's unofficial role.
