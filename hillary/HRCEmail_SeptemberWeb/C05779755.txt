Thanks. Here is today's communiqué from the Elysee as provided by the French Embassy. English
translation is unofficial.

                                              COMMUNIQUÉ


       In recent weeks, Laurent Gbagbo's forces have repeatedly used heavy weapons against the civilian

population. In Resolution 1975, which passed unanimously on March 30, the Security Council asked the UN
Operation in Cote d'Ivoire (UNOCI) to prevent such atrocities.
        In accordance with its mandate to protect civilians, UNOCI has therefore just initiated actions designed
to neutralize the heavy weapons used against civilian populations and UN personnel in Abidjan.
        The UN Secretary-General has asked French forces to support these operations. President Sarkozy
assented and authorized French forces, acting in accordance with the mandate granted to them by the Security
Council, to take part in UNOCI operations to protect civilians.
        France calls for an immediate halt to all violence against civilians. The perpetrators of these crimes must
be held accountable for them before a court of law.
