Jake, I'm not sure S really wanted a copy of the dialogue document that the Yemeni opposition leaders referred to ad

move on.) Jeffrey Feltman

First:

Assuring that the national dialogue leading to the implementation of the article from the February 2009 agreement,
which states creating constitutional amendments that would result in developing the political and electoral system
including the proportional list, which is the right path to guide the country from its current crises.




Second:

assuring that the referendum on the constitutional amendments is conducted first, then to go on with preparations for
the parliamentarian elections including the proportional list.




Third:

            In order to achieve the above, our suggestions are:

a) The national dialogue approves the reforms resulting in developing the political and electoral system including the
proportional list by the end of this year, after that a follow up mechanism is to be agreed upon in order to implement
what have been approved by the national dialogue.

b) Specify an implementation mechanism:




1.       Following up with entering referendum and electoral law to the parliament.

2.       Following up with the necessary constitutional and legal reform to what the national dialogue approves of.

3.    After the approval of this framework, wide discussions shall be held to address the political and parliamentarian
electoral reforms with respect to the subjects under the national dialogue, the parliamentarian elections shall be
conducted only after the referendum on these reforms.
