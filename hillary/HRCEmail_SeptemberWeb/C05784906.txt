ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Political rivals took aim at Pakistan's leaders on Monday over the killing of Usama
bin Laden, compounding U.S. pressure over the al-Qaida leader's hideout, as the prime minister prepared to
address parliament on the crisis for the first time.
   Pakistan's main opposition party is stepping up calls for the prime minister and president to resign over the
breach of sovereignty by U.S. special forces who slipped in from Afghanistan to storm the compound where bin
Laden was holed up.
   "We want resignations, not half-baked explanations," an official of former prime minister Nawaz Sharifs
Pakistan Muslim League told the News daily.
   Pakistan welcomed the death of bin Laden, who plotted the Sept. 11, 2001, airliner attacks on the United
States, as a step in the fight against militancy but also complained that the U.S. helicopter raid to kill him was a
violation of its sovereignty.
   Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani, who will make his statement when parliament sits at 1200 GMT (0800
EDT), is expected to deliver a stern warning against further military missions inside Pakistan by foreign
forces.
