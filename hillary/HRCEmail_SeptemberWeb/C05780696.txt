Subject: Egypt's new cabinet sworn in - MENA (Reuters)

CAIRO, July 21 (Reuters) - Egypt's new cabinet was sworn in on Thursday, state news agency MENA said, as
the ruling military council sought to meet demands from protesters for faster political and economic reforms.

   Around half the interim cabinet members were replaced including the foreign affairs and finance ministers,
officials announced. Interior Minister Mansour el-Essawy kept his post.

  The ceremony was delayed after Prime Minister Essam Sharaf suffered a drop in blood pressure earlier this
week as he struggled to finalise last-minute appointments.
