MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said on January 13 Iran's offer to tour the Islamic
Republic's nuclear facilities deserved attention and should we welcomed.
Lavrov cautioned that such a visit could never replace regular inspections from the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) or talks with major powers on Iran's nuclear program.
