Subject: Syrian tanks enter resort town near Lebanon-residents (Reuters)



AMMAN (Reuters) - Syrian tanks stormed the town of Zabadani near the border with Lebanon on Monday after
Ramadan evening prayers, residents said, the latest military thrust to prevent pro-democracy demonstrations
from spreading during the Muslim fasting month.

   More than 20 tanks and armoured personnel carriers entered the resort town in the foothills of the Anti-
Lebanon mountain range  after residents held a street demonstration in support of the central city of Hama,
witnesses said.

    At least three protesters in Zabadani were injured by machine gun fire from the tanks, two witnesses said.
