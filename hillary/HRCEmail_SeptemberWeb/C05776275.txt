I don't want to keep you hanging all evening. I will spare you the excuses; we think we can have you something by 9:00.
In some ways it's getting rougher before it's getting smoother, as we get the top right and add examples. But it would be
very good to have you engage again to make sure we are going in the right direction. This draft also benefits from
extensive comments from Jack, Raj, and Jake. AM
