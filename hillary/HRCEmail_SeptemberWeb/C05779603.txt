I know there are more challenges right now than anyone can track, let alone try to influence.

BUT, I just wanted you to know I'm sitting in the General Assembly for the official launch of UN Women and the screen
just lit up with ER and the Universal Declaration and then you in Beijing saying "WR are HR "
The place erupted in sustained applause. You are here in spirit! What you have sparked is so significant.
Needless to say, Tina Brown is here!
