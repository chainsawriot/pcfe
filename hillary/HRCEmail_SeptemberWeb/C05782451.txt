On the London mystery guest:

Our latest info is that despite yesterday's reports, Libyan PM Baghdadi did not/not come to the UK. The mystery Libyan
plane carried Mohammed Ismail, Saef Qadhafi's chief of staff (and the guy who has been talking to the Norwegians).
The FCO sees him today.

Can you find out exactly what Stavridus said and in what context and whether he made any followup comments?
