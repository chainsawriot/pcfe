Subject: Saleh to look at restarting Yemeni peace plan (Reuters)

RIYADH (Reuters) - Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh has agreed to look at restarting a Gulf Arab
initiative on solving the country's crisis and ensuring a peaceful transfer of power, a Yemeni government
official said Wednesday.

  The official said Saleh had met members of Yemen's ruling party in Riyadh, where he has been receiving
medical treatment since being badly injured in an assassination attempt in June.

   "He agreed with them to explore ways of restarting the GCC initiative and of creating a mechanism that will
ensure a peaceful transfer of power," the official told Reuters after Saleh's meeting with the ruling party
members.
