Subject: Medvedev proposes Putin for president in 2012 (AP)

   MOSCOW - (AP) Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has proposed Vladimir Putin as presidential
candidate for 2012, almost certainly guaranteeing Putin's return to office.
   Medvedev made the proposal Saturday in an address to a congress of United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party
that dominates Russian politics.
   There was no immediate official reaction from Putin or the party, but the proposal brought a heavy round of
applause from the congress delegates.
   The proposal appears to end months of intense speculation over whether Medvedev would seek a second term
or step aside for his powerful predecessor.
