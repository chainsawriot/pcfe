Subject: UN rights body launches new inquiry on Syria

GENEVA (Reuters) - The U.N. Human Rights Council launched a new commission of inquiry into Syria's
crackdown on anti-government protesters, including possible crimes against humanity, despite objections by
countries including Russia, China and Cuba.

   The 47-member forum easily adopted a resolution presented by by the European Union and the United
States. The vote was 33 countries in favour with four against and 9 abstentions. Libya's membership in the
council was suspended earlier this year so it has no vote.

   "The resolution is adopted," Uruguay's ambassador Laura Dupuy Lasserre who chairs the Council,
announced after the vote.
