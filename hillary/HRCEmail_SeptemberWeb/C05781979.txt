Subject: Clinton visit

Dear Ms. Adashek,

Please pass this message on to Vernon Jordan as soon as possible.


Dear Vernon,

I hope you are well.

This week Hillary Clinton will visit Hungary. I suggest that she should be very careful to avoid an
embarrassment. The press is already full with remarks that her visit will be seen as an approval for the
Hungarian government and Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

She should be aware that Mr. Orban's government is demolishing democracy in Hungary and is
introducing a harsh system with disregard of human rights and freedom of speech. For her information I
attach two articles:

Please warn Mrs.Clinton before her trip to Hungary (planned for June 30). I am always available for help
or information. Unfortunately I fear that the US Ambassador in Hungary, who is very close to Mr. Orban
may not give her a full, balanced view of the dangers involved. Unless she makes a public statement about
worries of dictatorial tendencies in Hungary, her visit will be seen as supporting an autocratic regime.

With warmest regards to Ann and you,
Ivan Fischer
