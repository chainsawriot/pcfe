Subject: Syria rights group: dozens killed in clashes (AP)



BEIRUT (AP) - A rights group says fresh clashes between Syrian soldiers and army defectors have left at least
17 members of the military and 14 civilians dead.
  The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says that the fighting took place Sunday in the
northwestern province of Idlib, the central province of Homs, and the southern village of Dael.
  The clashes reported on Monday were the latest sign of a trend toward the militarization of the 7-month-old
uprising against President Bashar Assad.
  The uprising began in mid-March and Assad has reacted with deadly force that left 2,900 people dead,
according to the U.N.
