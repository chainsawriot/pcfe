Madame Secretary --

I just wanted to let you know that on Friday with Citi making an official announcement of a support pledge, the US Expo
team for Korea 2012 here at EAP State now has raised nearly 9 million dollars allowing us to formally launch our national
effort led by Philippe Cousteau and his Earth Eco team. We have also received support from Chevron, Boeing, Samsung,
Lockheed, Hyundai among several others.

We are within two to three million of our final goal with almost a year left and with plenty of time to design and build
our completely innovative film exhibit and experience using a wall of water.

Also Daniel Day Lewis from Lost and Hawaii 50 has agreed to serve as an honorary chair and Michele Kwan from Olympic
Ice skating will join the EAP team full time to work on this effort. I know we joked a lot about this but I just wanted to
thank you for having the confidence in us to get this done.

Our national exhibit has carefully studied the Shanghai experience and I promise we will deliver a model of creativity and
excellence that will make us proud. So thank you for letting us take this on. Best Kurt
