             Now that we have New Start ratified we can move on missile defense cooperation with Russia, CTBT,
FMCT and other priorities. DFM Ryabkov is coming to DC at my invitation on 1/28 to begin talks on MD.

It is an honor to work tor you, my Mend.
Hope to see you soon. Ellen

Dear Hillary,



I hear from Dianne and my staff that New Start is in play in the final CR/tax extension deal so I'm hopeful although I find
the process disturbing.
