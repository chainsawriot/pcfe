Many thanks for sticking with me through this crazy confirmation process. I imagine your enthusiasm for ever calling
John Cornyn again is under control, but I deeply appreciate everything you did. It's a genuine honor working for you,
whatever the title, and I'll do my best as Deputy.

Warm regards,

Bill
