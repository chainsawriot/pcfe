Subject: Obama, Karzai say undeterred by killing of Rabbani (Reuters)

NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Barack Obama September 20 condemned the killing of the head of
Afghanistan's High Peace Council, former President Burhanuddin Rabbani, and vowed it would not stop the
United States from pressing on with its mission there.

  Afghan President Hamid Karzai, at the start of talks with Obama on the sidelines of the U.N. General
Assembly, said Rabbani's death "will not deter us" from continuing the quest for peace.

    Rabbani, who had been tasked with trying to negotiate a political end to the war with Taliban insurgents, was
killed at his home Tuesday.
