Subject: Brazil's Rousseff gov't hit by another resignation (Reuters)


BRASILIA (Reuters) - A top official at Brazil's agriculture ministry tendered his resignation Saturday following
corruption allegations, the latest blow to President Dilma Rousseffs seven-month old government.

  Three cabinet ministers have resigned in the last three months due to alleged corruption or disputes with
Rousseff, straining relations with members of her coalition and slowing economic reforms in Congress.

   Brazilian newsmagazine Veja reported that Executive Secretary Milton Ortolan had allowed a lobbyist to set
up an office within the ministry to help businesses get contracts in exchange for illicit payments.

    The agriculture ministry said Ortolan tendered his "irrevocable" resignation but denied wrongdoing.
