Subject: RE: Rumors -- Kirk, DeMint Holds




Just spoke to his staffer. He says Kirk would like to have his meeting with you on Tuesday before
proceeding with confirmation.


                                                                                               I told him it would
be incredibly hard to get S on the phone given the time difference.

And then we still have the rumored DeMint hold. DeMint's office refuses to call me back.

Subject: Rumors -- Kirk, DeMint Holds

We don't have confirmation yet, but we're hearing Senators DeMint and Kirk may have a hold on Bill's
nomination.

I'm going to run this down on a staff level. Bill, I know it's short notice, but anything we can do to have
folks weigh in on those two would be good.

Thanks.
