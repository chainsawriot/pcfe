We just had a quick call with Ambassador Scobey:

•        It was a violent night last night with lots of looting and little police presence throughout most Cairo
neighborhoods (although a small army presence began posting at key points around the city).

•         About 20 Embassy vehicles were destroyed/stolen from the Embassy, though there was no attack
on the Embassy itself. 100% of Embassy staff has been accounted for. DS Mobile Security Detachment
expected to arrive tomorrow.

•           Up to 50,000 were already gathering in Tahrir Square today; Amb. Scobey expects tonight to be just
as bad, if not worse than last night. There continues to be no police presence.

•           New government has not yet been named.

•           Airport is open; traffic is moving throughout the city.

•         While situation throughout Cairo neighborhoods is worrisome, the rest of country and key tourist
sites seems to be calm.

•           Internet and cell phones are back up.

•         Consular Affairs reported 486 calls from Americans expressing concerns about
welfare/whereabouts.

•           Cairo EAC is meeting now, and will consider whether to request ordered/authorized departure.

Our response:

•         U/S Kennedy and M staff are beginning to explore options for charter aircraft to Cairo and then
onward to Frankfurt.

•         We are standing up a task force starting today in the operations center to monitor security situation
and handle growing volume of American citizen calls.
