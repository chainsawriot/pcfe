Background on Somalia: The humanitarian crisis in the eastern Horn of Africa is rapidly evolving due to prolonged
drought conditions, Which have resulted in food insecurity, water shortages, and acute malnutrition rates well above
emergency thresholds, particularly among Somali refugees arriving at camps in Ethiopia and Kenya. Almost 12 million
people in the region are in need of emergency humanitarian assistance. The number and condition of Somali refugees
flooding into Kenya and Ethiopia is particularly alarming. As many as 20 percent of the newly arrived children under five
suffer from severe acute malnutrition, which far exceeds the standard emergency rate of two or three
percent. According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the total number of Somali refugees in the
eastern Horn is 582,000. Ethiopia has 135,000 Somali refugees, with 20,000 arriving in June alone, while Kenya has
more than 430,000 with 20,000 arriving in the last two weeks of June alone â€”rates strikingly higher than the 2010
monthly rates of 1,500-2,000 in Ethiopia and 4,000-6,000 in Kenya. The current flows threaten to overwhelm the
existing refugee assistance infrastructure.
