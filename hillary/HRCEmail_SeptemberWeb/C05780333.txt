Subject: Jordan police fire tear gas to stop clash, 20 hurt (Reuters)


AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordanian police used tear gas on Friday to stop fighting after pro-monarchy youths threw
stones at a group of Salafis, ultra-conservative Sunni Muslims, demanding freedom for detainees in Zarqa city,
witnesses said.

   At least 20 people were hospitalised after clashes erupted when dozens of youths carrying batons and rocks
attacked scores of Salafis, returning from a rally at a mosque rally to demand the release of more than 200 high-
security prisoners, they said.

  A security source who confirmed the police used tear gas to disperse the groups said several arrests were
made and an investigation was underway.
