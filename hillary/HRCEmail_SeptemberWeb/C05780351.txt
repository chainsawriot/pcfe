I was on Anderson Cooper tonight debating Richard Haass, who described what was happening in Libya as a "civil war." I
said that Gaddafi wants us to think it's a civil war, but he has to hire mercenaries to fight for him, and as soon as the
cloud of fear is lifted just a little bit citizens declare their hatred of him. I note this because when I got back to my
computer I must have 100 messages on Twitter and Facebook from Libyans thanking me for making the point. I think we
can support them in part just by pushing back against the idea that this is anything other than a popular revolt. The
gratitude in these messages is really something.
