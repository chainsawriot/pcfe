Subject: Hamas, Egyptians meet on Israeli soldier handover (AP)

GAZA CITY (AP) - A Hamas official says that the Palestinian group is meeting with Egyptian intelligence
officials to discuss how to transfer a captive soldier to Israel.
   Hamas-backed militants have kept Sgt. Gilad Schalit in hiding since his capture in a cross-border raid in
2006.
   Hamas will transfer Schalit to Egyptian officials, who will return him home. In exchange, Israel will release
1,027 prisoners, as part of a swap deal concluded last week.
   The discussions underline the tricky details involved in the deal.
   The Hamas official says some militants fear Israeli forces will seize Schalit if they know his location during
the transfer.
   The Hamas official wouldn't say if the Saturday meeting had ended. He spoke anonymously because of the
matter's sensitivity.
