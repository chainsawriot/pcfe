Colin will send report to mulet (who will share with us), dorsinvil and bellerive probably later tonight. Press
statement likely tomorrow, followed afterwards by public dissemination of the report. Granderson/mulet
said the focus now has to be on encouraging the cep to make right decision (meaning soft pedal their
fraud). Once the right decision is final, mulet said they have to be made an example of, and investigated
for criminal behavior.

On inauguration, the french and spanish foreig ministers will likely attend, as will the brazilian defense
minister. For canada, the quebec governer general may attend. Colombian and domrep presidents will
also attend
