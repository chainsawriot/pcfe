Subject-




I just got off the phone with                3nd she does not want to be on the International Joint Commission
US/Canada because it is a full time job. PPO has suggested to me that they would like her to
                                                  She was very happy with that when I told her. So we moving forward
with that Board appointment for her.




Regarding the IJC, PPO says they have 3 choices for the position. I asked them (in an email) who they were because
Secretary Clinton has a great interest in the position. They have not gotten back to me on that.




We don't have a second choice. Would you like me to make a call to                                  and see if he is
interested?




Thanks. Steve
