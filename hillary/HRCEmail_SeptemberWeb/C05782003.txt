  Subject: Aussie PM tells Libyan leader to get out of way (AP)

  CANBERRA (AP) - Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard has called on Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to
  get out of his people's way and to face charges for alleged crimes against them.
     Australia was among the first countries to call for the United Nations to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya as
  Gadhafi's forces violently suppressed rebellion among his people.
     Gillard told reporters on Monday it appeared that rebels were about to secure Libya. She said Australia will
  support the country toward peace and democracy.
     She said: "We continue to call on Col. Gadhafi to get out of the way and of course we believe he should face
  the international charges that are against him."
     Gadhafi faces charges of crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands.
