Subject: Egyptian military deploys in Cairo under curfew (AP)

CAIRO (AP) - Egypt's military has deployed on the streets of Cairo for the first time since anti-government
protesters took up their challenge to the regime of President Hosni Mubarak four days ago.
  Parts of the ruling party headquarters in Cairo were going up in flames apparently set by enraged protesters
demanding Mubarak's ouster.
