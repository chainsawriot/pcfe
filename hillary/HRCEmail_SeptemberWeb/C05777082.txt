Dear H: A message from                                    soulmate who, like me, agreed with every word of your speech.

"The Secretary did a SUPERP job and the audience responded with a standing ovation. They loved her. I am grateful and
relieved. We heard many compliments.



Now I believe we can be helpful through the back door in breaking the stalemate.

We have an idea. Off the record - and you know I have never violated my word to you that only you know of my and
      efforts at the time of the suspension of the settlements moratorium - we have an idea. But must remain back
door and only becomes official when principals propose and agree.
You said you could put me in touch with someone we both can trust to hear what we see as a way to break the
stalemate.

I have two suggestions for us to talk to - old friends who know me and whom you trust:

1) Geo Mitchell - did you know Geo was my first "boss" in 1971 in a presidential campaign - Ed Muskie's? (I was the
"national youth coordinator" when every "youth" I knew, including Hillary Rodham and Bill Clinton, was for George
McGovern)

2) Jim Steinberg - my buddy from my WH days.

Or whoever you suggest. We want to meet off-the-record, no one can know, to share this idea.

As to your speech - it must get wider circulation.

I am going to write about it in my Hill column next week (also appears on Huffington and Daily Caller). Can you have
someone send Ito me ASAP?)

My heart truly was filled with gratitude and admiration for the courage you showed last night - courage because your
words were tough love equally for both sides.

Tough love for both sides.

Isn't that what you have done all your political life - fact-based policies and positions, whether offending purists on
either side -- or both?

Best,

Lanny
