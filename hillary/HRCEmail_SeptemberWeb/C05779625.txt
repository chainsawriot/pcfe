Subject: Senior Libya official flies to Greece-Tunisian source (Reuters)


TUNIS, April 3 (Reuters) - Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelati Obeidi has crossed from Libya into
neighbouring Tunisia and from there flown to the Greek capital, a security source at Tunisia's Djerba airport
told Reuters on Sunday.

   Asked about Obeidi's whereabouts, the security source, who did not want to be identified said: "He travelled
to Athens." Earlier, Tunisia's official TAP news agency said Obeidi crossed overland into Tunisia and was
heading to Djerba airport, near the border.
