BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates has agreed to send 12 aircraft to join the international
coalition enforcing a U.N.-mandated no-fly zone over Libya, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said on Friday.
"I spoke at 10.30 p.m. (2100 GMT) to the crown prince of the UAE, who told me that the Emirates have
decided to commit 12 planes to the coalition," he told a news conference after the first day of a European Union
surrunit.

   The UAE becomes the second Arab state to sent aircraft to the coalition after Qatar, which has sent two
fighters and two military transport planes to Crete.
