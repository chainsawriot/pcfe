Subject: Explosions hit 3 gas pipelines in Iran, halt flow (AP)

TEHRAN (AP) - Iran's semiofficial Mehr News Agency says three explosions have hit gas pipelines near the
country's holy city of Qom, in the same area where simultaneous blasts took place two months ago.
   The lines carry gas from Iran's gas refineries in the south to the country's northwest.
   The report says Friday's explosions cut the gas flow through those lines but power plants switched to oil for
electricity production.
   Mehr says an investigation is under way as to what caused the blasts.
