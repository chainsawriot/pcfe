Subject: Bangladesh Supreme Court sets Yunus appeal hearing for March 15 (Reuters)


DHAKA (Reuters) - The Bangladesh Supreme Court has set March 15 to hear an appeal by Nobel laureate
Muhammad Yunus against a High Court decision to uphold his removal from microlender Grameen Bank, a
verdict his allies say was prompted by a government vendetta.

  His lawyers said on Wednesday the appeal was referred to the full bench of the appealate division for next
Tuesday. They gave no details.

   Yunus, 70, was removed as head of the bank on the grounds that he had stayed on past the legal retirement
age of 60. There has been no official explanation so far as to why the removal came now and not 10 years ago.
