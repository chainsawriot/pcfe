PERSONNEL SENSITIVE

Madam Secretary, given your focus on Baghdad staffing issues, I would like to raise proposals regarding two specific
components: 1) Covering the period of Iraqi government formation and summer transition. 2) Selecting Chris Hill's
successor.                                                                                                        B5
                                                                                                                  B6
Iraqi government formation period and summer transition

The Iraqi government formation process will move into full gear in late March, approximately two weeks after the March
7 elections when the official election results will be certified. Embassy Baghdad (with a large number of Arabic-speaking
officers) and USF-I will work with Iraqi leaders to promote the formation of an inclusive cabinet that doesn't cross any
U.S. red lines. I propose Washington staffing support for the field as follows:




In addition, of course, we would have Washington phone calls, strategic communications messaging, diplomatic
outreach to Iraq's neighbors and beyond, and VIP visits to help with the government formation process. But I have

concentrated on what we would do to augment staffing in the field in ways that I hope will bolster Washington
confidence in our efforts.

Chris Hill's successor




Given your meeting tomorrow with the Vice President where Iraq staffing may come up, I wanted to send you these
thoughts quickly. With the exception of NEA PDAS Ron Schlicher, I have not had the opportunity to talk to Bill Burns or
others about these ideas.
