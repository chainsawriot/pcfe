Subject: Pakistan denies complicity, incompetence in bin Laden case (Reuters)

ISLAMABAD, May 9 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani on Monday rejected allegations that the
killing of Osama bin Laden by U.S. troops in the country showed Pakistani incompetence or complicity in
hiding the al Qaeda leader.

   "Allegations of complicity or incompetence are absurd," Gilani told parliament, adding that it was
disingenuous for anyone to accuse Pakistan, including its spy agency, of "being in cahoots" with the al Qaeda
network.

   Gilani said unilateral actions such as the U.S. Navy SEALs swoop on Obama's hideout run the risk of serious
consequences, but added Pakistan attached high importance to its relations with Washington.
