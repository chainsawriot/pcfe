Not sure you know about the article about Lauren in the St. Mary's newsletter. The email is from Dee Delaney,
                     and an alum! So exciting! B

Did you know that Hillary's executive assistant Lauren Jiloty is a   grad of Saint Mary's College? I read about her in
the Saint Mary's alumnae magazine.

Hillary must be having quite a week with the Chinese prime minister in town. In fact she's probably at the state dinner
right now!
