And Happy New Year to you!

My team made contact w Fahed al-Atiyah, and I also raised the Global Food Security Trust Fund w the Emir and HBJ.
We'll work toward an announcement when the Emir visits DC in February.

I was sorry to miss Tony in Oman and hope to talk w him this weekend. And I hope we'll have another chance to visit
early in the new year.

All the best, Hillary

Happy New year Hillary

So sorry you did not meet up with tony yesterday but I know you are on a whirlwind.

Whilst you're in Doha do you have any time to meet with the Chairman of the Qatar Food Security Programme. I have
mentioned their work to you before. They are looking to invest $10million into food security over the next few years.
He is called Fahed Al Atiyah and his contact number is              if your office can squeeze him in.
