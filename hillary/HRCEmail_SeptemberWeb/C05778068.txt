Subject: Burma's Suu Kyi going online after detention (AP)

RANOON (AP) - Burma's pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi is ready to go online after years of
detention when the military regime allowed her virtually no contact with the outside world.
  The Nobel Peace Prize laureate was released from seven years of house arrest in November.
  Her security chief Win Htein said she has been allowed Internet access and will begin to broaden her
domestic and international contacts online after recovering from a cold and cough.
  He says that she may even be tweeting soon.
