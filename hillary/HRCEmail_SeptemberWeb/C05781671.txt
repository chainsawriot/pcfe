Subject: Pakistan puts travel curbs on US diplomats (AP)

ISLAMABAD (AP) - The Pakistan government has placed travel curbs on American diplomats in another sign
of the breakdown in ties between the countries since the May 2 American raid that killed Osama bin Laden.
   A letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent to the American Embassy states that all diplomats must
now get special permission to leave the capital.
   The restrictions would appear to be a violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations that
requires host states to allow foreign diplomats "freedom of movement" in the country except for restricted areas.
   The letter, dated June 13, was obtained by The Associated Press Saturday.
