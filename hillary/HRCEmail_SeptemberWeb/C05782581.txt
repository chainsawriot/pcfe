Subject: Israel returns envoy to Jordan after minor protest (AP)

JERUSALEM - (AP) Israel's Foreign Ministry says the country's ambassador to Jordan has returned to his
post after an anti-Israeli protest in the Jordanian capital fizzled out.
   Spokesman Paul Hirschon says the ambassador returned to Amman on Friday.
   Thursday's protest was touted as a "million man march" against Israel but drew about 300 people to the
streets of Amman.
   Israel had cleared out most of its embassy staff ahead of the rally, though it said the personnel had simply left
for the weekend as usual. The move came a week after an angry mob in Cairo broke into Israel's embassy there
and the staffers had to be rescued by Egyptian commandos.
   Both Jordan and Egypt have peace agreements with Israel that are key elements of Mideast stability.
