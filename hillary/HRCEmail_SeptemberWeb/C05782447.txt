        response. (Comment: We have not seen the letter in the Africa
        Bureau.)

     2) The Senator will be sending an editorial or article to the Los Angeles
        Times as well as other news outlets tonight.

The Senator concluded by saying that he was giving the Africa Bureau a heads
up as a courtesy..

Comment: Senator Inhofe has close ties to President Gbagbo, has criticized our
Cote d'Ivoire policy and has resisted our previous efforts to get him to call
Gbagbo to step aside.
