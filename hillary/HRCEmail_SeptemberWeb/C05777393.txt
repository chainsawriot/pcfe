Subject: Is Galvan Sick?

I've made a few calls and compared notes with the Canadian ambassador.

Here is the line everyone is sticking to: both the foreign ministry and presidency were surprised he
cancelled. Espinosa called him.
                                    He wants to reschedule.

The only added color from the Canadian ambassador is that he saw Galvan last week and arranged
a visa for Galvan's wife,
           .so perhaps he may be sick.

It still is hard to swallow. All of the pieces are too coincidental. The Canadian ambassador is
reporting back that Galvan really does seem to be sick. At this point I think we keep a raised
eyebrow.
