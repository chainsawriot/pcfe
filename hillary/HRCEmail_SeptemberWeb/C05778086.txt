Subject: Urgent need to talk

CDM:

When can we talk today? I would prefer that it be after 5:00 p.m.

Subject of discussion:
              ailed me this morning to spell out for me in detail the direction in which he is now willing to go on the
elections, his rationale and his timetable for a process that would conclude with a legitimately-elected President and
Parliament before mid-May. It does begin with the cancellation of the Presidential elections of November 28.

He expressly asked that I contact you directly this afternoon to discuss it. He himself will be unavailable most of the
afternoon and told me that anytime before early evening for a report of our discussions would be fine.

Regards.

GV.
