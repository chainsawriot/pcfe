Re: Qaddafi's location


Seymour Hersh, the investigative journalist for The New Yorker, was approached within the last 48 hours by a source
who was a former financial beneficiary of the Qaddafi regime asking him whether he wished to conduct an exclusive
interview with fugitive former Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi, according to a close friend of Hersh. Hersh was told that
Qaddafi is in Chad. He was also told that Qaddafi intends to wage endless war from his new location. Qaddafi helped
install the Chad president, ldriss Deby, supporting him when he overthrew Hussein Habre in the fall of 1990.
