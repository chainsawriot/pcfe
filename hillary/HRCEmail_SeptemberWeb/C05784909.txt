Cheryl,

Thank you for an excellent meeting today.

Please note the following:

            •   We have a meeting on the AIDS speech tomorrow. I discussed this with Lorrie yesterday and they are
                prepared with venue options and prepared to move quickly. We will be looking for your direction on
                message, venue, and timing in this meeting.

            •   We will provide you with a BCL for the Friday meeting with the principals.

            •   I advise that there be two meetings with the Secretary.

                    o    First, a meeting between the Secretary, you and Ito discuss fully the intensified effort on
                         maternal mortality —The 24 Hour Imperative - and our desire to make this an enduring
                         achievement. In this session, we can discuss organization, branding and provide fuller detail on
                         the effOrt.

                    •    Second, a meeting between the Secretary and the principals to review the overall strategy for
                         Gill with specific focus on Saving Mothers and Children. In this meeting, the Secretary's
                         message is one of unity and discipline in pursuit of our global health goals. We will do a BCL for
                         your review.

                These meetings could be held in either order as long as she is aware of both of them.

                Please let me know if you concur with this approach.

                I am here all this week and in Africa next week.



                Yours,

                Lois
