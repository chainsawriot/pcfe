Subject: Wave of Attacks in Iraq Leaves at Least 57 Dead (NYT)




BAGHDAD (NYT) - Insurgents across Iraq launched their most significant and wide-ranging attacks in months
on Monday, using suicide bombers, car bombs and gunmen to attack Iraqi security forces and civilians.
At least 57 people were killed in the attacks and over 100 wounded.
Coming a little less than two weeks after the Iraqi government said it would negotiate with the United States
about keeping some of its 48,000 troops here after the end of the year, the violence raised significant questions
about the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.
The violence touched nearly every region of the country, except for Kurdistan, and appeared to be targeted at
both Sunni and Shiite areas.
The most significant attack occurred in the city of Kut, south of Baghdad, where a series of explosions inside
the city's main market killed 35 people and wounded 71, according to a local security official.
In Diyala Province, north of Baghdad, there were at least a dozen explosions, killing 6 people and wounding 29,
according to a local security official. Gunmen attacked two checkpoints in Diyala's capital, Baquba, killing five
Iraqi security forces.
Two car bombs in the southern Iraqi city of Najaf killed 8 and wounded 20, according to a health official.
In Salahuddin Province, which borders Diyala, two suicide bombers attacked an Iraqi counterterrorism unit in
the city of Tikrit, killing 3 security officers, including a high ranking member of the counter-terrorism unit, and
wounding at least 10 people, according to a security official.'
There was violence in the capital, Baghdad, too. A car bomb was detonated near a government convoy in the
neighborhood of Mansur, wounding five people, including two security guards, according to security officials.
The violence was so severe that the interior minister sent out a message to all of the country's security forces
and traffic police to clear the streets of parked cars.
The attacks appeared to be the most significant since July 5, when nearly three dozen people were killed in the
city of Taji, north of the Iraqi capital.
Violence had appeared to be trending down. In July, 178 people were killed in Iraq, excluding the semi-
autonomous region of Kurdistan, according to statistics complied by the Interior Ministry. That marked a
significant decrease from June, when 342 people were killed and in May 321 were killed.
