BRIDGETOWN (AP) - The Barbados government announced the death of Prime Minister David Thompson at the age of
48.
  It says Thompson died early October 23. It was announced last month that he was being treated for pancreatic cancer.
  Thompson, who has been prime minister of Barbados since January 2008, first became ill in March and took a leave of
absence from his post in July. Deputy Prime Minister Freundel Stuart has been running the government in Thompson's
absence.
