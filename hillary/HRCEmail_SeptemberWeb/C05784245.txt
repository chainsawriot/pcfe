Subject: UN fails to agree on condemning Syria (AP)


UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The UN Security Council has failed to agree on a statement condemning Syrian
violence against peaceful protesters.
   France Britain, Germany and Portugal circulated a draft media statement on Monday calling for the 15-
member council to condemn the violence.
   But during consultations Wednesday afternoon, several members including Lebanon indicated they were
opposed, council diplomats said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the meeting was closed.
   Security Council statements to the media must be approved by consensus.
   At the request of the Europeans, the Security Council then moved into open session to hear a briefing on
Syria from the UN political chief and statements from council members.
