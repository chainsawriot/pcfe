 New Public Opinion Survey Findings from Pakistan
  Office of Opinion Research, U.S. Department of State



 A January 2011 Office of Opinion Research survey of Pakistan's four provinces, conducted largely before
 the recent shooting incident in Lahore involving a U.S. embassy employee, finds favorable opinion of the
 U.S. has returned to levels found before flooding struck the country in mid-2010. Favorable opinion had
 increased last fall, likely due in part to U.S. flood relief efforts.

                 percent express an unfavorable view (49% very unfavorable).

     •           The survey was conducted January 9-30, 2011.

                        somewhat unfavorable, or very unfavorable opinion of the United States." (%)
