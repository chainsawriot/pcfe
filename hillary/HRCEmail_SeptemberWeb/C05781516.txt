Subject: Fuad Zlitny call

Qadhafi's interpreter Zlitny (who I have been talking to about the Amcits and journalists, especially Clare)
called me with what he said was a message from "you know." There was clearly somebody feding him some of
these lines. He repeated the line that events have changed and that the U.S. must see the situation for what it
is: Hizbollah, Iran, Al-Qaeda, the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt are all manifestations of a radical Islamic
movement sweeping the region. The U.S. must use its influence to stop UK and France from the bombing.
Zlitny said the Libyan Government recognizes its mistakes from the start of the crises, but believes that now
the crisis (of radical Islam) is real . We must find a way out of this situation: there are misunderstandings that
we can iron out. The GOL would accept a face-saving way out that includes a ceasefire and monitors. If we are
ready to talk, Fuad said he would be the designated channel. I said I would pass up his message.

He said don't worry about the journalists. I urged him to let Claire call home.
