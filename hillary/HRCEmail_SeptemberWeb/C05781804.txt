Benghazi Sitrep #17, April 22, 2011

Political/economic developments

Code! McCain: Senator McCain had an enthusiastic reception in Benghazi. The INC welcomed his strong
statements of support, and US flag-waving Libyans cheered him wherever he went. The INC praised the
introduction of US Predator aircraft and asked that the US jam Libyan television broadcasting. The TNC's
finance minister told him that his top priorities are to obtain a line of credit to meet basic needs, and to find a
way under the sanctions to allow trade with the liberated parts of Libya. He was impressed by the civilian
leadership but came away with serious doubts about the military's leadership, organization, and capabilities. He
was heartened to hear that the INC plans to shake up the military leadership and appoint a minister of defense-
equivalent as early as next week. In a press conference, he advocated the use of more effective US strike
aircraft in the NATO missions and US facilitation of 3rd party arms transfers to the rebels; he stopped short of
endorsing the introduction of US military advisers, saying that role could be filled by others. He was clearly
moved by the plight of the people of Misrata and visited a hospital where he met a number of patients who were
severely wounded in the fighting there. The Human Rights Watch representative in Benghazi and a TNC
member from Misrata briefed him on the situation there.

Consular issue: Conoff received the deceased Amcit's personal effects from the IOM representative in Benghazi
and submitted them to the UK delegation in Benghazi in order to be flown out with the body. The Amcit's body
departed Libya on the evening of 22 April.

Injured Amcit                vill board a UNICEF-chartered ship that will depart Misurata at 2300 local time on
22 April and wiii arrive in Malta approximately 22 hours later.

A memorial service for the journalists was held at the Tibesti hotel, attended by INC deputy chairman Abd al-
Hafidh Gogha, the UK envoy, and the US envoy. Ghoga and the envoys also delivered remarks.
