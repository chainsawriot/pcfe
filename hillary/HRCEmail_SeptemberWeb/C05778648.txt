Subject: Warplanes bombing many locations In Tripoli-resident (Reuters)

LONDON (Reuters) - Warplanes were bombing many locations in Tripoli on Monday, a resident of the Libyan
capital told al Jazeera television in a live broadcast.

   "What we are witnessing today is unimaginable. Warplanes and helicopters are indiscriminately bombing
one area after another. There are many, many dead," Adel Mohamed Saleh said.

   Asked if the bombing was still happening he said: "It is continuing, it is continuing. Anyone who moves,
even if they are in their car they will hit you."

      There was no independent verification of the report.
