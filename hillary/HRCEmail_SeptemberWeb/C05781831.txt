Subject: Libyan rebels say Gadhafi's ex-No. 2 has defected (AP)


BENGHAZI (AP) - Libyan rebels say a close Moammar Gadhafi associate who was once the No. 2 top regime
official has defected in another blow to the increasingly isolated Libyan leader.
   Abdel Salam Jalloud helped Gadhafi stage the 1969 coup that propelled him to power and transformed Libya
from a monarchy to a republic. He was Gadhafi's most trusted deputy for two decades but began to clash with
the leader starting in the 1990s.
   Rebel spokesman Mahmoud Shammam said Friday that Jalloud had fled to a rebel-held area in the western
mountains and was on his way to Europe. Pictures showing Jalloud in the western town of Zintan appeared on
rebel Facebook pages.
   Another rebel official, Abdel-Hafiz Ghoga, says that Jalloud defection, "gives us assurance that Gadhafi is
weakening."
