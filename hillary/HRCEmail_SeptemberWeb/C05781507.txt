Subject: Palestinians: Israeli PM called off secret meeting (AP)


RAMALLAH, West Bank - (AP) A senior Palestinian official says Israel's prime minister scuttled a secret
meeting last week meant to head off a looming diplomatic showdown at the United Nations.
   Yasser Abed Rabbo says Israeli President Shimon Peres asked his Palestinian counterpart, Mahmoud Abbas,
to meet to discuss the Palestinians' plan to seek U.N. recognition of their independence in September.
   He says Peres promised to bring creative ideas for defusing the crisis.
   Abed Rabbo says Abbas traveled to neighboring Jordan for the secret meeting last Thursday, but at the last
minute Peres called to cancel, saying Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opposed the meeting.
   Israel opposes the Palestinians' U.N. initiative.
   Both Peres' and Netanyahu's offices declined comment.
