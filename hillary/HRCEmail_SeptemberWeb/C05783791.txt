Subject: President Bush

Hi Huma â€” we want you and HRC to know that President George W. Bush and Amb. Nancy Brinker (from the Komen
Foundation) will be at Betty Ford's service today and may raise the breast and cervical cancer partnership that we're
joining with the Bush Institute and the Komen Foundation. The initiative is called the Pink Ribbon-Red Ribbon
partnership. As Lana knows, we've communicated with Bush's staff this morning about a Sept. 13t h launch of the
partnership and working on details.

More info below and in the attached memo (which HRC has already seen).

Please let us know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Rachel and Jen



Background on Pink Ribbon-Red Ribbon Partnership

The Pink Ribbon-Red Ribbon Partnership will include the Department of State, the George W. Bush Presidential
Center, Susan G. Komen for the Cure, and UNAIDS and will combat cervical and breast cancer in low- and
middle-income countries in Africa and Latin America. The goal is to announce the partnership in a DC launch
event on September 13th, prior to the UN High-Level Meeting on Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), which
will take place during the UN General Assembly this fall. The Secretary's participation in this launch event will
give the U.S. a significant deliverable to highlight at the UN High-Level Meeting on NCDs. It will also build on
her longstanding commitment to women's. health, including access to prevention, screening, and treatment of
women's cancers. Details of the partnership, including the USG's contribution, are in the attached memo.

Melanne talked about this partnership with HRC in Lithuania.
