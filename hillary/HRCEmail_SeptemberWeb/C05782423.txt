Dear members of the Electoral Support Group ("Demarche Group"):

It's been a while since we were last in contact, because all seemed to go well. But now, we got wind that the CEP will
probably announce tomorrow Tuesday that it cannot stick to the 31 March date to issue the preliminary results (!). It
seems that they will say that the announcement will now be made on April 5, in order to comply with the recommendations
of the OAS. They say they want to be rigorous and thorough in their work at the Tabulation Center level. They could be
ready for the presidential results, but not for the legislative, so they would like to wait to announce them all together. If
confirmed, this would delay the whole calendar for at least a week. It seems that the appeals process will also take more
time than expected, taking us all the way until the end of May for the inauguration of a new president. We shall see
tomorrow what happens. Best, Edmond.
