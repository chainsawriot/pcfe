I have heard from several people in touch with                                              that Saif now will not/not         1.4(D)
announce that Q is stepping down and that he, Saif, is assuming duties as transitional chief. Instead, the Tripoli crowd is B1
considering two different approaches for a speech that is still supposed to take place Saturday evening Tripoli time. One
approach is to call on the supporters of the regime to prepare for a big battle to defend Tripoli, to defend Tripoli to the i .4(B1
death. The second approach, which reportedly is where they are leaning, is to have a reconciliatory speech that calls fcB1
a transitional process, constitutional reform, etc. — all good concepts but failing to include the necessary punch line of
Q's departure.                                 says that                    is seeking confirmation that some key countries
would welcome Saifs speech if Saif takes the second course, arguing that knowing the speech will be praised tips the 1.4(D)
balance in favor of that approach.                                                                                          B1

We are off now to see Abduljalil, TNC Chairman, to reinforce the points about trying to find a solution that avoids
massive bloodshed in Tripoli. We were awakened this morning to a huge amount of celebratory gunfire on the reports
that Brega has fallen to the rebels. Despite the large number of casualties being suffered by the rebels, I do not believe
we're going to find much incentive on the TNC's part to negotiate right now.

I leave tomorrow mid-day for Cairo.
