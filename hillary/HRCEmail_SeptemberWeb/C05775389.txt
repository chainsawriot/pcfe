Thank you for passing this on to the appropriate people.

Dear Madam Secretary:




I was in Krakow, along with our chairman, Madeleine Albright, for the 10th anniversary celebration of the Community of
Democracies. I just wanted to express our appreciation for your inspirational speech in defense of civil society. Your
remarks were warmly received by the group assembled in Poland and sent an important signal to both friends and
adversaries worldwide about America's commitment to fundamental human and political rights. From NDI's
perspective, your words were also a message of solidarity to democratic activists who, in their peaceful struggle, can
often feel isolated and neglected.




Thank you for your continuing interest and concern.




Sincerely,




Ken
