STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON




One-Year Anniversary of Release of Abdel Basset Mohamed al-Megrahi




Regrettably, today is the one-year anniversary of the release of Abdel Basset Mohamed al-Megrahi, who was convicted
and sentenced to life in prison for his role in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland on December 21, 1988,
claiming the lives of 270 innocent people, including 190 U.S. citizens.




The United States continues to categorically disagree with the decision made by the Scottish Executive to release al-
Megrahi and return him to Libya last year. As we have expressed repeatedly to Scottish authorities, we maintain that al-
Megrahi should serve out the entirety of his sentence in prison in Scotland. We have and will continue to reiterate this
position to the Scottish and Libyan authorities.




We extend our deepest sympathies to the families who lost loved ones and share their desire for justice to prevail.
