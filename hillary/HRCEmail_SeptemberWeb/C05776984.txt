Jake:

A quick summary of what happened tonight in Dublin:

Cowen won the party vote of confidence tonight; the tally won't be made public
(yet). Finance Minister Brian Lenihan publically supported the Taoiseach and looks to have
improved his position in the party and for taking over FF having chosen the winning side
today. Martin gave a strong speech in opposition before the vote and was congratulatory to
Cowen publically afterward. He tendered his resignation (while stating he doesn't want
anyone else to follow his lead), which Cowen "reluctantly" accepted. Both Cowen and Martin's
remarks were complimentary toward each other and reaffirmed their friendship. Word is that
the Taoiseach will take on the FM's portfolio.

I don't know who will travel to Munich in Martin's place--if it is the Taoiseach and Martin
was on the calendar, we'd support a meeting with Cowen in lieu of Martin.

Best,
Jason
