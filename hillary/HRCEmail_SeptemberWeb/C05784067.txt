Subject: Syrian forces kill 3 women near Banias-activist (Reuters)


AMMAN (Reuters) - Syrian forces shot dead three women on Saturday who were marching in an all-women
protest near the besieged city of Banias, a human rights campaigner said.
   The women had joined a small demonstration on the main costal highway from Marqab, an adjacent village
to Banias.
   Their bodies were taken to the Bir Society hospital inside a Sunni district of Banias, said the rights
campaigner, who is in contact with residents.
