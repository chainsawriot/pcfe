Subject: Russia's Medvedev drives into West Bank for talks (Reuters)

JERICHO (Reuters) - Russian President Medvedev drove into the Israeli-occupied West Bank on January 18 for
talks with Palestinian President Abbas on reviving the moribund Middle East peace process. His convoy from
Amman airport in Jordan crossed over the historic Allenby Bridge, in an unusual route for a head of state
dictated by an Israeli foreign ministry strike which forced him to cancel the Israel leg of his trip. Palestinian
officials said they could not remember when a visitor of that level had used the Allenby crossing, which was
shut down to normal traffic for the occasion. Russia is part of "the quartet" of international powers overseeing
Middle East peace negotiations, though the United States plays the dominant role in diplomacy that has ground
to a halt due to a dispute over Israel's settlement policy. "It is crucial for us to continue our work with the
Middle East quartet ... to revive the talks," said a Kremlin official, speaking on the eve of the January 18 talks in
Jericho.
