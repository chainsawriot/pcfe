The attached is the sitrep from Post. The information below is the latest.


   •    OAS and Mulet are reportedly noting that voter turnout is higher than on November 28. Post contends
        that at this point there are conflicting reports related to voter turnout, and that low voter turnout could be
        attributed to church attendance. Post notes however, lower turnout in the southern claw.

   •     Post reports that the CEP has resolved issues related to missing voting materials in PAP. While lines
         remain long at certain sites, voting has started throughout the PAP area.

   •  Generally, the security situation appears calm with no major disturbances to report. While Post notes
      tension in some areas and scattered reports of minor problems in rural areas including bottle and rock
    • throwing, these are in no way comparable to the widespread demonstrations that we saw on November
      28. Most national and international press in PAP and are not reporting anything major at this time.

   •     In the last 24-36 hours there have been no reports of proposed Martelly or Manigat victory rallies.

   •     Press reported that Martelly and Manigat have voted as have Bellerive and Preval.

   •     It appears that the SMS system is delayed and at times not functional. This is likely attributed to a high
         volume of requests. The Ambassador is following up with Digicel and Voila on the matter.

    • No news on the Aristide front.

    •    Overall there are fewer reports of people not able to find their names on the voter lists. While there are
         still some issues, nothing comparable to November 28, and the orienteurs have been helpful in that
         regards.

    •    The STAFFDEL had the opportunity to visit two sites so far. One where everything appeared to be
         operating smoothly and a second where the voting material was delayed. At the latter, lines were
         significant and voters were singing and animated, but the situation did not escalate. MINUSTAH
         successfully delivered the necessary material before the STAFFDEL departed. They seemed pleased so

        far and will be spending the next hour with the Ambassador with an expected return to the Embassy in
        the next hour or two.

   •    According to Reuters, reports that Wyclef Jean was shot were incorrect. The Petionville police chief
        confirms that the singer cut his hand accidentally on a shard of glass. According to the police chief, the
        doctor who treated Wyclef has confirmed this point.
