AP: Hochul Victorious in N.Y. Special Election

Democrat Kathy Hochul has upset Republican Jane Corwin in a special three-way House election in New York that
became a referendum on the GOP budget plan that revamps Medicare.

The Associated Press called the race after 71 percent of the vote was counted, with Hochul taking 48 percent to Corwin's
42 percent. Independent candidate Jack Davis took 8 percent, running on a self-proclaimed tea party line.
