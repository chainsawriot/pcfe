Pan-Arab TV coverage of Libya March 14-16, 2011:

Summary: All stations monitored by the London hub (A1, AA, BBC Arabic, and al-Alam) are reporting on events in
Bahrain, though in different ways. On 3/15 A1 and AA largely ignored it in favor of reporting on Libya, but that has now
changed.

BBC and al-Alam lead bulletins with Bahrain news and report civilian casualties in much more detail than Nor AA. A1
had Bahrain opposition leader Ali Salman on saying Saudi forces should support political reform. A.I also just reported
that three security forces reported killed in clashes with demonstrators.

Of note is the tone of al-Alam, which featured 3/15 close ups of dead and wounded civilians in the streets of Manama
and calls by Bahraini religious figures for the international community to intervene. Footage on al-Alam is dramatic,
showing plumes of smoke pouring from Pearl Square, cell-phone footage of clashes in the streets, and protestors
confronting troops. End Summary
