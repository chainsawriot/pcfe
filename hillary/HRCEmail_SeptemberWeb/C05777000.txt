START's Next Stop: The Senate Floor



Today, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 14 to 4 to approve a treaty that will make all of us safer.

A bipartisan majority in the committee, including all of the Democrats and Republicans Dick Lugar, Bob Corker, and
Johnny Isakson, voted to approve the New START Treaty with Russia and send the treaty to the full Senate for a vote.

The strong showing in the committee increases the likelihood that the 67 senators necessary to approve the treaty will
vote for START on the floor—if they are given the chance to vote. With the elections approaching, the Senate could run
out of time to take up this important agreement.

You can help. Urge your senators to call publicly for a vote on the treaty and to ask Senate leaders to schedule a vote.
Urge your senators to vote "yes" on the new START Treaty

Why is the New START Treaty important for national security?

•       The treaty makes us safer. The treaty will reduce the number of deployed nuclear weapons in U.S. and Russian
arsenals.
•       The treaty allows U.S. inspectors to monitor Russian nuclear weapons. It has already been more than 285 days
since U.S. on-site inspections of Russian nuclear weapons and facilities were suspended when the previous START Treaty
expired.
        The treaty has the overwhelming support of military leaders and national security experts of both parties,
including current and former commanders of U.S.nuclear weapons, Colin Powell, Henry Kissinger, and many others.
