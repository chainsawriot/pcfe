Subject: Egypt to recognize South Sudan (AP)



CAIRO (AP) - An Egyptian foreign ministry official says Egypt will recognize South Sudan after secession
later this week.
   Mohammed Mursi told the Al-Abram daily on Tuesday that Egypt will name its new ambassador to Juba the
same day South Sudan declares its independence from the north. South Sudan is to become the world's newest
country Saturday.
   Sudan lies astride the middle reaches of the Nile, the primary source of water for mainly desert Egypt. The
White Nile, one of the river's two main tributaries, runs through south Sudan. Egypt fears an independent south
Sudan may come under the influence of rival Nile basin nations and affects its share of the river's water.
