Sorry. Just stepped outside without my phone.

Nothing really to report that can't keep.




The UK and Russians have put forward competing (strong v weak) resolutions on Syria, with much wrangling next week.

I'll keep sending you Libya updates. We talked about the need to get 24-hour coverage at the CW site.


Not too much else.

Just tried you thru ops to check in. No need to call unless there's something to report.
