He told me he was going no matter what I or anyone said and that he'd. Been invited by the DPRK.
                                                                                                               I don't
want BR saying publically I blessed in anyway.

Richardson is saying he has your blessing to go to NK to bring Gomes home. His trip is tentatively planned for 22 May.
ROK is going nuts - they are very worried about his trip.

Jim and I just spoke. He would like Cheryl to call him to dissuade him. We can let him know that the ROK is releasing its
report on 19 or 20 May and all signs point to a finding that implicates NK. Having him show up in Pyongyang shortly
thereafter will be problematic.

WH also likely to call.
