Subject: Vietnamese PM gets 2nd term amid economic woes (AP)

HANOI, Vietnam - (AP) Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung will remain at the country's helm for
a second term as the communist nation tries to overcome economic woes that deepened under his watch.
   The lawmaking National Assembly confirmed Dung's highly anticipated appointment Tuesday. He received
94 percent of the vote as the sole candidate. However, the position had already been decided by the communist
elite during the secretive Party Congress in January.
   Sixty-one-year-old Dung is a former central bank governor and is considered a reformer. Vietnam has been
slammed with growing economic woes during his tenure.
   It is battling huge trade and current account deficits, a weak currency and double-digit inflation that's
squeezing the country's poor by driving up food prices.
