I'm about 300 meters from La Reserve and it sounds like Haiti just won the World Cup. I've never heard such
excitement.                                                                                                               B1

I spoke with a friend (middle aged physician) who confirmed that there is a gathering at LaReserve to celebrate JCD's
return. He described the hotel owner as well known Duvalierist.
He suggested former govt employees and close duvalier types would be present.

Also spoke with Creative international country rep who lives in berthe, near la reserve. She hypothesized that this is
likely a maneuver by                                                                                 Apparently, JCD        B1
traveled on a dip passport (unconfirmed).                                                                                   1.4(D)

I spoke to another well known physician in his 60s, he explained that there were rara bands in the city and people have
taken to the streets in cite soleil. Rumors of Aristide's return have been paired with Baby Doc's return to perhaps
provide false hope of titid's return and to bolster prevals's popularity and thus jude's with the left.

There is a piece in Guatemala's paper datelined Paris that reports Duvalier's intent to retun today and quotes Preval
saying "if he thinks he is coming back to Haiti to find forgiveness, he will find justice." Might be apocryphal, but sounds
like a Preval sentence construction.
