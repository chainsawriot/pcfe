Subject: Report: Russia warns US over missile defense plans (AP)

MOSCOW - (AP)       Russia sees the planned U.S. missile defense system as a potential threat to its nuclear
forces and may review its participation in a landmark nuclear arms treaty, officials said Monday.

   The New START deal, the centerpiece of Barack Obama's efforts to reset ties with Russia and the most
significant arms control pact in nearly two decades, took effect last week. It limits each country to 1,550
strategic warheads, down from the current ceiling of 2,200.

   The treaty doesn't prevent the U.S. from building new missile defense systems, but Russia has warned that it
reserves the right to withdraw from the treaty if the United States significantly boosts its missile shield.

  Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov reaffirmed Monday that a buildup in the U.S. missile
defense capability would prompt Moscow re-consider its obligations under the New START treaty.

   "If the U.S. increases the qualitative and quantitative potential of its missile defense ... a question will arise
whether Russia should further abide by the treaty or would have to take other measures to respond to the
situation, including military-technical measures," Ryabkov said, according to Russian news agencies.
