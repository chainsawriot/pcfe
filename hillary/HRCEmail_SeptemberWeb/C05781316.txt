link between Muammar Gaddafi's government and one of the staunch allies of the Western coaltion determined
to overthrow him.

   Morocco has been one of the small number of Arab countries and the only North African state openly

looking and allowing the Libyan people to democratically determine their future."

  The ministry did not say how Boukraa had reached Rabat. Travel from Libya is restricted by a no-fly zone
imposed by the coalition.
