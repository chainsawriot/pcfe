Subject: Yemeni president to return this week, official says (CNN)




(CNN) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who is being treated in Saudi Arabia after an attack on his
compound, will return to Yemen on Friday, senior adviser Ahmed Al-Soufi told CNN.
The ruling GPC party said the president will be received by celebrations, but anti-government demonstrators
throughout the country likely would not welcome his return.
The protesters are demanding that Saleh leave office, and there were celebrations in the streets when he left for
treatment.
"Saleh's arrival back to Yemen is not a surprise; we said all along that he is travelling for medical treatment and
like any other president in the world, is expected to be back to his country and continue with the role of
leadership," said Yasser al-Yamani, a senior Saleh aide.
Al-Soufi said that Saudi doctors have given Saleh the green light to return home.
"When he is back, he will rule as normal and the country will continue to be under his control. Saleh will return
strong and the will of the people will stand against any other will," he said.
Saleh will rule until the end of his term in 2013, Al-Soufi added.
Opposition leaders called news of Saleh's return false rumors.
"The ruling party are experts in lying and that is why we are not taking their comments seriously," said Hasan
Zaid of the opposition Haq party.
'<haled Al-Anesi, prominent Yemeni rights activist and a leading figure in the youth revolutionary movement,
said the "youth are now coordinating with the political powers here in Yemen in preparation for the post-Saleh
era" and noted that it is "impossible for Saleh to come back."
"The youth have the backing of the international community and the Saleh era is over," he said. "Yemenis will
not allow Saleh back in Yemen and he is smart enough to know that he is not wanted anymore and that
Yemenis have decided to live without him."
Wassem Al-Qirshi -- representative of the revolution youth organizing committee, the largest of the groups that
comprise the youth revolutionary movement -- said "the youth want to coordinate and create a transition council
but we are trying to involve all political factions in the process except the ruling party."
Government forces have been locked in conflict with al Qaeda's Yemen wing, and authorities fear the group,
called al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, is exploiting the political instability. It has a strong presence in
southern Yemen.
Many people have fled their homes because of violence. Close to 45,000 people in southern Yemen have been
displaced, particularly in Aden, Lahj and Abyan provinces, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of
