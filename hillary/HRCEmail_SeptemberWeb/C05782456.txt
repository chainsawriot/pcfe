Subject: The Speech

Rough translations I've seen suggest it was total, unadulterated crap - long on conspiracy
mongering, short to non-existent on reform details. Only mitigating element is that we're exactly
where we'd be if we had scripted the speech for him: waiting to see what actually happens.
