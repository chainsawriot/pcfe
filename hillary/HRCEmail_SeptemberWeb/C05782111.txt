Subject: Syrian gunboats fire on coastal city; 5 killed (AP)


BEIRUT (AP) - Activists say Syrian security forces are storming several districts in the Mediterranean coastal
city of Latakia under heavy shelling and gunfire.
   At least five people have died in the shooting according to Rami Abdul-Ralunan, head of the London-based
Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the activist network the Local Coordination Committees.
   Abdul-Rahman says gunboats in the Mediterranean are taking part in Sunday's assault. He says they are firing
heavy machine guns at Latakia's el-Ramel neighborhood.
   At least 20 tanks and armored personnel carriers rolled into el-Ramel Saturday amid intense gunfire.
   The operations in Latakia are part of a crackdown on several cities to root out protesters demanding the
ouster of President Bashar Assad.
