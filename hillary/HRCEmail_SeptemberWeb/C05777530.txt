Subject:                      some support from Adm. Mullen on budget



Mullen gave a Foreign Press Center briefing today; in the pre-brief his staff gave him Adm.
Stavridis's statement on the QDDR. In the Q and A he went on a long riff about State Dept must
have the necessary resources to carry out its diplomatic responsibilities. He said that DOS budget
had been cut to the bone in 1990s and this meant DOD had to shoulder more civilian
responsibilities. Must find the right balance and he advocates strongly for this and a more robust
DOS budget. Small diplomatic investment at start of a crisis saves a lot of money in the long run.
