Speaking for State

Meanwhile, chatter at the State Department is about the likely move of career Foreign Service officer Victoria Nuland,
former ambassador to NATO and now special envoy for conventional forces in Europe, to be the department's
spokeswoman.

The expected move was first reported Monday by our pal Laura Rozen at Yahoo News â€” though it's been in the works
for a couple of months. The possibility has raised a few eyebrows in town because Nuland, who's married to political
scientist and Washington Post columnist Robert Kagan , was principal national security adviser to Dick Cheney starting
right after the invasion of Iraq, from July 2003 to July 2005. (Of course, we recall that Hillary Clinton was a backer of that
war.)

On the other hand, during the Bill Clinton administration, Nuland was chief of staff to Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott, a longtime Clinton pal.

Given Nuland's foreign policy chops, one would assume she will have ready, direct access to Secretary of State Clinton,
which of late has not always been the case with spokespersons. Another question is whether Nuland will be the
traveling spokesperson when Clinton goes overseas. That role has often been taken by longtime Clinton aide and former
Senate press secretary Philippe Reines, who has also been the one sitting in when Clinton is interviewed by reporters.

Mike Hammer, now acting assistant secretary for public affairs, is still expected to be nominated to take that job on a
permanent basis.
