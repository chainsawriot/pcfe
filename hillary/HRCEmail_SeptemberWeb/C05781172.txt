Subject: Australia minister pleads for food aid for Somalia (AP)


DOLO (AP) - Australia's foreign minister says Somalia's famine will be five times worse by Christmas unless
the international community increases its food aid.
   Kevin Rudd is in a famine-struck area of Somalia to appeal to the world to help avoid a catastrophe. Rudd on
Sunday talked with internal refugees who have had little to eat in recent days.
   World Food Program's Executive Director Josette Sheeran said Sunday the program will open new feeding
sites in and around Dolo by the end of the week. She said it is critical that WFP gets new funding to fight the
three-pronged catastrophe of drought, conflict and high food prices.
