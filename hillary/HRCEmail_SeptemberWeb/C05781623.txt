Subject: Arab League summit postponed until next year (AP)



CAIRO (AP) - The     Arab League says its annual summit that was to have been held in Baghdad this month has
been postponed until next year at Iraq's request. Thursday's Arab League statement says Iraq has retained the
right to host the summit in March 2012. The summit was first scheduled for March in Iraq but was
subsequently delayed for May as turmoil gripped the Arab world and concerns persisted about Baghdad as a
venue.
