Subject: Israeli president begins pardoning Palestinians (AP)

JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel's president has begun the process of formally pardoning hundreds of Palestinian
prisoners who are to be released in exchange for an Israeli soldier held by Gaza militants for five years.
   A spokeswoman for President Shimon Peres says he received the prisoners' files on Saturday and has 48
hours to sign the pardons. The swap will likely happen Tuesday.
   Under the deal, 1,027 Palestinians will released in two stages in return for Sgt. Gilad Schalit, who was
captured by Hamas-backed militants in a 2006 cross-border raid.
   The list of prisoners included in the deal is to be publicly released, and in a mostly symbolic gesture, the
public will be able to raise appeals.
   Among those to be freed are Palestinians who planned suicide bombings.
