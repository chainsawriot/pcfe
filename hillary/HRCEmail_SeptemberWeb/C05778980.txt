Subject: Israel and new Egyptian leadership make contact (Reuters)

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel and Egypt's new military rulers have made initial contact and Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday welcomed their pledge to stand by Cairo's peace treaty with the Jewish state.

Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak and Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, head of Egypt's Higher Military Council,
spoke by telephone on Saturday, a ministry spokeswoman said, declining to give further details.

   In remarks to reporters that echoed a written statement issued on Saturday, Netanyahu voiced satisfaction
that Egypt's military leadership had announced it would respect all the country's international treaties.

   "The peace agreement was kept by Egypt throughout the years ... it is the cornerstone of peace and stability,
not only for the two countries, but for the whole region as well," Netanyahu said at the start of a cabinet meeting
in Jerusalem.
