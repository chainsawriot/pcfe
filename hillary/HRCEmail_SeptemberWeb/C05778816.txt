Subject:                          one more quick thought re women and Egypt



I think it could be important for you to make the point that we need to be hearing from all of Egyptian society, the voices
of women as well as men. There are plenty of women evident among the protesters. Where are their voices? Who is
representing their needs in negotiating with the government or just more generally? This is a real-time opportunity to
insist that women be present and accounted for. AM
