Subject: Yediot: "The Prime Minister thinks the land swap formula is a joke"

 Wanted to make sure you guys saw the below article, which appeared in Yediot Hebrew earlier this week(the
INT covered only part of this). This is my translation, so it's unofficial. As you know the Palestinians read the
Israeli press closely (and take it at face value), so I thought it was worth circulating.

Best,

"The Prime Minister thinks the land wimp formula is a joke"
said a senior official close to Netanyahu. He said that the attempt to find a common formula with the Americans is proving
problematic because the Prime Minister is not just opposed to the formula of the 1967 lines as the basis for discussions,
but also to the very concept. "Netanyahu has a double problem: he is faced with self (ideological)-limitation and with a
political constraint"

Difficulty at the top: Israel and the United States are working hard to achieve an outline agreed
formula to renew diplomatic negotiations that will be presented to European states and that will allow
the EU to oppose a unilateral declaration of Palestinian statehood at the UN, and to pressure them to
return to negotiations. But attempts to bridge the gaps between the approaches positions of Barak
Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu are proving difficult in the senior most levels in Jerusalem because
of the determined opposition of Prime Minister to the phrasing used by the U.S. president, that
unambiguously defined the 1967 borders as a basis for discussions.

A senior official close to Prime Minister said tonight (Sunday) that Netanyahu opposes not only the
formula of the 67 lines as a basis for discussion, but also to the very concept.

"Netanyahu has a double problem: he is faced with self(ideological)-limitations and with political
constraints," the senior official said.

"Netanyahu is driven by his view, which has not changed, that the formula of 67 lines with one for one
swaps, is just not acceptable to him." This official, who spoke with Netanyahu on the issue, also said
that "the land swap formula is a joke. Israel has no land to give within the framework of this formula,
and it is completely contrary to the Prime Minister's position. He is not only against Obama's
formulation, but to the idea itself."

"Maximizing the communities in our control"

Additionally, regarding the settlement blocs, there are many misunderstandings and disagreements.
Prime Minister Netanyahu treats the settlement blocs differently from the Americans, who see the big
population centers in Judea and Samaria as the red line beyond which they do not intend to
compromise. The Prime Minister, in turn, is looking for a formula that would enable Israel to keep as
many Jewish settlements beyond the Green Line as possible.

"Netanyahu does not use the expression of the large blocs as much as he refers to areas of 'national
and strategic importance", said another senior official close to Netanyahu.

"He opposes the idea that Israel will be required to withdraw from the rest of the Territories and is
looking for a formula that will leave as many settlements under Israeli control."

Meanwhile, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called on the United States to adopt whatever the
July 11 Quartet formula will be. Jerusalem, however, is not convinced that the Palestinians want to
"go all the way" with their September plan. "There is an effort to prevent the United Nations
declaration in September," said a Minister close to the prime minister. "Right now, the opposition of
the Jordanians, and questions about Saudi support for unilateral declaration are very significant and
influential on the Palestinians. The goal is to find a formula to return to the negotiating table, so that
the Americans, Israel and the Europeans will be happy."
