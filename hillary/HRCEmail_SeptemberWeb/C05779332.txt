Yes, what the latest rumors are that he will fly out on a plane arranged by Danny Glover (who just
landed in Joburg and is organizing the return) and Trans Africa at 3. They will have reporters on
board as well. I am supposed to get a call from the SAG in a half hour confirming this.. .will see if they
actually call.
