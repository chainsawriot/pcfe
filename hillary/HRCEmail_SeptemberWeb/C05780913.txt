 What about the shuttle? Are they also on time? I don't mind taking one this afternoon.

 I just heard back from Mark -- due to crew rest issues today, they cannot move our departure time earlier and we have
 to keep with 6:00pm. We will monitor storms so you don't leave home too early if something is rolling through.

I'm worried about the weather forecasts for thunderstorms. Can you pls check if I should leave earlier (or later?) to be
safe?

They can basically do whatever you'd like -- should we say 6:00pm?

Bill can't get home until late tomorrow so is there any chance I could either leave later or take a later shuttle?
