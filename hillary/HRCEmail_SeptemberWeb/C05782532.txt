Increase (MSI) for the quality of their cumulative and
competitive performance. In accordance with the
Procedural Precepts for the 2011 Foreign Service Selection
Boards, the Boards recommend conferral of MSIs for
employees who were rank ordered by the Selection Boards
but who were not promoted because of limited promotion
opportunities. MSIs were awarded in accordance with the
rank order and in accordance with the ten-percent limit
for the employees in competition groups. A statement
noting MSI recognition will be placed in each member's
Official Performance Folder.

5. Employees recommended for an MSI who have reached the
highest salary step of their grade before July 1, 2011
will be granted a cash payment of $2500, subject to the
availability of funding. Employees, who were granted a
MSI in the previous 52 calendar weeks, cannot be awarded
the increase. The recommendation will become part of the
employee's Official Performance Folder. The MSIs become
effective October 23, 2011.
