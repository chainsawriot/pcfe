 That's the same message I just got from Jovan Ratkovic. Jovan asks if we can confirm if that time will work (though could
 be delayed even further if the parl session goes on longer) and asks if we can send him a number to call in to as he
 would make the call. Can I give him the Ops number if time will work? Please let me know ...

Subject: Re: Serbia calls

Amb Petrovic reports that President Tadic wants to take the call, but is tied up in parliament. They suggest making the
call at 1900 our time (0100 in Belgrade). I said that I understood S availability to be only the next two hours, but that I
would report this availability of Tadic and get guidance.

Subject: Serbia calls

S says she's willing to call either Jeremic or Tadic or both, and she's free for next three hours.

As always she is way more of a trooper than I would be under similar circs.- If she's really willing
maybe we try do to back to back calls. But only if Tadic is willing to take.
