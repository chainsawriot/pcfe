Subject: Iran official holds security talks in Oman (AP)

MUSCAT (AP) - Iran's interior minister said his visit to Oman will focus on security issues, including
safeguarding vital oil routes in the Gulf. The visit by Mostafa Mohammad Najjar comes just days before the
scheduled arrival of U.S. Secretary of State Clinton, who is making several stops in the region. Iran's state
media reports Najjar's talks will include proposals for closer coordination on maritime security. Oman and Iran
share control of the Strait of Hormuz, the passageway for about 40 percent of oil tanker traffic.
