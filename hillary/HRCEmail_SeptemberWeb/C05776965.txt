Jake,
I understand that S is meeting with Japanese FM Maehara tomorrow, and wanted to make you aware of news reports today
indicating that Japan plans to announce shortly its intention to run for a UN Security Council seat for 2012-2013. Having just
left the Council after a 2009-2010 term, this would be the earliest opportunity for Japan to seek another seat, and likely
represents a strategy of seeking frequent election to a nonpermanent UNSC seat to bolster Japan's credibility in its pursuit of
permanent Security Council membership. To date, Fiji, Kyrgyzstan, and Pakistan have announced their candidacy for a single
Asia Group seat up in 2012. Japan has served ten times on the Council, tied for the most with Brazil.
Esther
