Subject: Gaddafi's son Mohammed flees house arrest-Jazeera (Reuters)


CAIRO (Reuters) - Forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi helped his son Mohammed flee house
arrest on Monday, Al Jazeera television reported, as rebels sought to secure full control of the capital Tripoli.

   Mohammed Gaddafi was among three of Gaddafi's sons to be captured by the rebels. The loyalist fighters
stormed the house where Mohammed was held and set him free after clashes with guards there, the pan-Arab
news channel said.

   It said NATO was working with the rebels to mount coordinated air strikes on Muammar Gaddafi's heavily
fortified Bab al-Aziziya compound in the capital.
