Subject: Thousands denounce Yemen leader's remarks on women (AP)


SANAA (AP) - Thousands of Yemenis have demonstrated against the president after he criticized the
pariticipation of women in anti-government protests.
   On Friday, President Ali Abdullah Sakti said in a speech that the mingling of men and women at "Change
Square," where daily anti-government protests take place in the capital, was against Islamic law.
   On Saturday, demonstrators countered that his comments were an insult to women and the people of Yemen
as a whole.
   Thousands of women marched in Sanaa and several other cities to denounce the comments.
   The revolutionary youth who have been behind the two months of anti-government protests in this
impoverished country, urged the people to come out to the streets in millions on Sunday for a day of "honor and
dignity."
