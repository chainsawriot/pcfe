Subject: Bahrain's king orders end to emergency law (AP)

MANAMA (AP) - State media in Bahrain says the king has ordered an end to the emergency rule imposed in
mid-March to quell a wave of anti-government protests in the Gulf country.
   Bahrain state TV said the state of emergency will end June 1 in line with a royal decree issued on Sunday.
   The announcement comes as 21 opposition leaders and political activists have been charged with attempting
to overthrow the Sunni monarchy in a special security court set up by the emergency rule.
