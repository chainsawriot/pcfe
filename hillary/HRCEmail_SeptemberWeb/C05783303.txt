Subject: Saleh rival says Yemen leader pushing to civil war (AP)


SANAA, Yemen (AP) - The main military rival of Yemen President Ali Abdullah Saleh says the returning
leader appears set on driving the country into civil war and has called on the international community to rein
him in.
   Maj. Gen. Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar has issued a strongly worded statement calling Saleh a "sick, vengeful soul"
and comparing him to the Roman emperor Nero, burning down his own city.
   Saleh loyalists Saturday launched heavy assaults on his rivals in the capital in fighting that killed at least 40
people. It comes a day after Saleh returned from Saudi Arabia following three months of medical treatment for
wounds suffered in an assassination attempt.
   Al-Ahmar, who commands the 1st Armored Division, was a Saleh ally until he joined the uprising against his
rule.
