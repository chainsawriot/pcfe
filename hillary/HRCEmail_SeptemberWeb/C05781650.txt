Subject: Tunisia

I have a meeting scheduled with Jeff Feltman this afternoon to review the concept of a "transition team" for Tunisia. I
have put together a list of functions and identified potential candidates for some of the slots which I will discuss with
Jeff when we meet. In the meantime, we have designated officers within ECA and IIP who will be focused on Tunisia and
who have already begun to work with the CAO there on some of the education and information initiatives. I met
yesterday with Mike Posner and members of his team and Mike is planning a trip out there in the next few weeks to
meet with civil society groups, with a special focus on the impending elections. Finally, the PA team is developing a
media training plan to complement the work being done by USAID and MEPI.

I have kept Gordon Gray up to speed on what we have done to date and he has responded enthusiastically so far.

Will keep you posted.
