Subject: Thune urges US to recall ambassador to Syria (AP)

LAS VEGAS (AP) - Sen. John Thune says the United States should recall its ambassador from Damascus amid
Syria's deadly crackdown. Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, on Saturday told a meeting of Republican
Jews that Damascus did not deserve to have a U.S. representative as Syrian security agents have made sweeping
arrests. Syrian President Bashar Assad has tried to end two weeks of pro-democracy demonstrations that are
threatening his family's rule. The Bush administration in 2005 recalled the ambassador to Syria. Last year,
Obama used a recess appoint to send career diplomat Robert Ford to Damascus. Thune earlier this year
weighed a White House bid but has said he is no longer interested in a 2012 campaign.
