Dear Hillary,

I thought you would find this paper by my friends David Ludwig from Harvard and Kelly Brownell from Yale very
interesting, as well as an analysis of how Big Tobacco and Big Food are similar.

The approach of most government interventions and industry initiatives is education and encouragement of personal
responsibility.

There is an element of blaming the victim and misses the "structural violence" as Paul Farmer describes it, of the
environmental conditions that drive obesity and disease.

The more I dig into the food marketing practices (which the IOM reported on a few years ago), the biologically addictive
properties of junk/processed food, the food deserts, the over availability of cheap, high calorie, nutrient poor food, the
clearer it is that these environmental factors over ride normal physical and psychological mechanisms that control
weight. These factors, in fact, erode personal freedom.

The mantra of big food is:




         It's all about personal responsibility
         There are no good foods or bad foods
         Regulation infringes on civil liberties
         Focus on exercise over diet.




The food industry makes the right "noises" but will not self-regulate just as Big Tobacco wouldn't. Some great things are
being done by the Adminstration, and Title IV of the ACA is encouraging, but we need to create healthier defaults for
citizens by actually doing the things that Thomas Frieden (the director of the CDC) suggests including a penny per ounce
tax on sugar sweetened beverages, removing all unhealthy food choices from schools, child care, health care and
government institutions, eliminating children's exposure to food advertising on TV.

I also think funding a national Health CORPS – which trains 1/2 million to a million community health workers to go into
communities, schools, churches armed with the sound knowledge about creating health could make significant dent in
our health care crisis AND create jobs!! It's a bit of a New Deal approach, but if we can combine creating jobs, reducing
health care costs and improving health and productivity, then it is a win for everyone (except the food industry).

I know you are passionate about this — and thank you for letting me share this with you.... When the victims are our
children, it breaks my heart and drives me to do something.

I know it may not seem like it, but this problem is easier to solve than Middle East peace...:) ---- we know the causes and
the solution. It is not like we have to find the cure for cancer. In fact pediatric obesity will have more impact on life
expectancy of children than ALL cancers COMBINED.

Your notion of it takes a village couldn't be more appropriate for addressing this whole epidemic of obesity and chronic
illness....

Thank you!!!!

Mark
