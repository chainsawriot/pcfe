Yes, this is likely the PBS interview for a documentary on women/peace that we need to clear with you for either
tomorrow or Friday.

Hey Hillary- heard through the grapevine you're going to be sitting down with a good friend of mine this week for an
interview- Abigail Disney. She has been an incredible resource and coach over the last few months as I push forward to
finish my film. Her project on women, war, and peace is also incredibly powerful. We now live in a time when it is more
dangerous being a civilian in war than it is being a
soldier- all the more reason her project is so important. Hope you had a good fourth of July and got my fingers crossed
we get to catch up soon. You're deeply missed. xxooz
