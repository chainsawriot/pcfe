Subject: Libyan rebels advance towards Zawiyah west of Tripoli (Reuters)

NORTH OF BIR SHUAIB, Libya, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Rebels in western Libyan advanced north to within 25
km (15 miles) of the coastal city of Zawiyah on Saturday after fighting a six-hour battle with pro-Gaddafi
forces, Reuters journalists at the scene reported.

   Rebel fighters pushed government troops back about 7 km from their previous positions, fixing a front-line
about 5 km north of the village of Bir Shuaib, near a diaper factory.

  Rebels pushing north from the mountains southwest of the capital are hoping to capture Zawiyah, cutting off
Gaddafi's stronghold Tripoli from access to the outside world along the coast road.
