Colleagues,

As you know, Congress reached an agreement late Friday evening to fund government operations until a full budget is
passed. As a result, the U.S. government will continue operating normally.

Over the last week, with the outcome in doubt, managers had to make difficult decisions and had many discussions â€¢
about how to proceed. This included designating those legally "excepted" functions necessary for the protection of life
and property while the government discontinued most operations. Even though these never went into effect, I want to
be clear that these designations in no way reflect on the importance of employees' individual contributions to the U.S.
Government or the American people whom we serve.

I appreciate your patience and understanding as we all waited for Congress to appropriate new funds. Now that a bill is
passed, we can continue the critical work we are all engaged in to advance that national security Interests of the
American people and allow us to be good partners to our friends and allies around the world.

Thank you again for your understanding, dedication, and continued service to our nation.

Sincerely,

Hillary Rodham Clinton
