Subject: Tunisia PM tells Ben All not to return (Reuters)

TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia's ousted leader Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali told Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi
he was considering returning from exile, but Ghannouchi told him that was impossible, a government minister
told Reuters.
   Najib Chebbi, an opposition leader who is now regional development minister in a coalition government,
said the exchange happened in a telephone conversation after Ben Ali, toppled by weeks of protests, fled to
Saudi Arabia last week.
