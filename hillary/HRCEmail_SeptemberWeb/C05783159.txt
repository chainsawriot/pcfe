LONDON (Reuters) - British police said on Monday they had arrested seven people in a major counter-
terrorism operation in Birmingham but said the arrests had no connection to a major political conference taking
place in the central English city.

   Six men were arrested overnight on suspicion of preparing an act of terrorism and a woman was held on
suspicion of failing to disclose information that could help prevent an act of terrorism, a police statement
said.

    The Liberal Democrats, junior partner in Britain's coalition government, are holding their annual conference
in the city this week.
