Subject:                           Japan visit next week



I am in India but wanted to quickly weigh in on the prospects of a Japan stop next week after Europe. I well recognize
how brutal the travel schedule has been and have been reluctant to add to that given pressing current circumstances in
Libya and elsewhere.

However I believe the Secretary should consider going to Japan for a brief stop next week to do several things:
underscore our commitment to Japan and manifest it with more publicity for all we are doing; indicate that we will
launch a public private recovery effort; subtly counteract preoccupation worries; meet crisis team in government; thank
embassy and military relief team; meet some of the displaced; and speak publicly to the Japanese people.

We can do this in one day and have an historic impact, quite seriously given the stakes and gravity of the situation.
Happy to develop a schedule to support this effort if warranted. Best Kurt
