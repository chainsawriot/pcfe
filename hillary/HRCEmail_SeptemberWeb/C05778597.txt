Thank you Carlos -- your grace is something to be emulated.

I will flag this so that you have such an opportunity with her.

And I will follow-up.

Best.

Cheryl -- Thank you for our talk yesterday. It probably was not easy for either of us, and you handled it well. I know the
Secretary's plate is always overflowing. I would very much appreciate it if I could take a few minutes with her on this
matter. It could be by phone, or I could fly back if it would be possible to talk in person. There is a lot at stake, and I'd
like to do all we can to achieve the best outcome. Thanks for your understanding. Carlos
