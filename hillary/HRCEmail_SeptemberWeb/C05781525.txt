   LONDON (AP) - Britain has expelled two more Libyan diplomats, declaring that their activities are contrary
to the interests of the U.K.
   Foreign Secretary William Hague's decision Thursday comes only a week after Britain expelled the Libyan
ambassador to Britain. That move followed attacks on the British embassy in Tripoli.
   A ministry statement says the diplomats and their dependents have until next week to leave the country.
   Hague says the status of the Libyan Embassy and its staff is under constant review and that he judged the
behavior of these individuals to have become unacceptable.
