For Senate Archives, I was the one to meet with the starters of "Project Rebirth" that is written up today in the
Times and elsewhere and sounds truly gripping. This Manus Coone , of all thin • s, was Hatch's 'udici lead
and well, off the record,
                                Some little birdie told me in my brain that it was he who came in to tell us
about the planned documentary, and lo and behold, that form of the "tweet" was right!! Best to all. Xoxo

Tamera —

Wow. What a memory. Yes. I was involved back then. Was helping a guy named Steve Mendelson who was serving as
the Exec. Dir. The organization was trying to get some legitimacy with policymakers. They weren't a client but a friend
of mine was on the Board. My aim was to help get them in front of policymakers in DC who cared and who could help
give their effort some credibility. You and Secretary Clinton were GREAT. You really helped them get traction and
legitimacy. Wish I could say the same about the Bush Administration.

How are you doing these days? Hope all is well on your end. Happy to be getting an email from you. Attached and
printed below is my contact info. I am partnered with Shawn Smeallie, Sheryl Cohen, and David Urban over at
ACG. Good people.

Take care,

but in case it is, am I off my rocker or remembering correctly that you were part of Project Rebirth, the result that I just
read about in the Times??
