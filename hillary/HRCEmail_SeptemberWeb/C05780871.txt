Subject:

THE BEST SUCCESSOR, if Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner takes the exit ramp this fall (after a debt-ceiling deal and the
release of his white paper on corporate tax reform, but before non-stop politicking): Erskine Bowles, White House chief
of staff under President Clinton. This West Wing is a little scratchy about remarks Bowles made during Simpson-Bowles
deficit-commission, but he's credible and confirmable. You also have to list Roger Altman, investment banker and deputy
Treasury Secretary under Clinton, just because he always gets mentioned.

--WHAT WOULD PIAYBOOK DO? Move OMB Director Jack Lew to Treasury, make economic adviser Gene Sperling the
budget director, and give his job to John Podesta. Jake Siewert could run the Center for American Progress.
