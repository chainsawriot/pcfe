Subject: Media group slams NATO bombing of Libyan TV (AP)


BRUSSELS (AP) - The head of an international journalists' group is denouncing NATO for its attack on Libya's
state television network.
   The International Federation of Journalists' Beth Costa on Wednesday condemned the airstrike "which
targeted journalists and threatened their lives in violation of international law."
   Costa says the use of "violence to stifle dissident media spell catastrophe for press freedom." He urges NATO
to refrain from further attacks against media.
   NATO says the bombing Saturday targeted the TV network's satellite transmitters in a bid to hinder Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi's use of television to incite violence against the population.
   Libyan officials say the airstrike killed three people and injured 15 others.
