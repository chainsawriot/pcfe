Subject: more on Saudis

Word has it that Prince Bandar was in Pakistan last week asking for troops to be deployed in Kingdom and Bahrain to
deal with civil unrest. Might also be used in other gulf states. There is precedence for this, when Pakistan deployed
troops in the Kingdom in the 1980s to provide protection to the monarchy—and Pakistan was paid for it handsomely.
Apparently Bandar also went to China to get Beijing's support. Saudis are pushing Jordan to hang tough against reforms.
