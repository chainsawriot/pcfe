Subject: Norway ready to recognize a Palestinian state (AP)


OSLO, Norway - (AP) Norway's foreign minister says the Scandinavian country will back Palestinian
officials in their appeal to the U.N. for statehood.
   In a Facebook post late Saturday, Jonas Gahr Stoere wrote "Palestinians have the right to go to the U.N." and
Norway is "ready to recognize a Palestinian state."
   He also urged for talks to start between Israel and Palestinians, saying "only negotiations can solve things
between Israel and Palestinians."
   Frustrated by their inability to win concessions from Israel, the Palestinians have tried to gain attention with a
high stakes wager on statehood and U.N. membership.
   On Sunday, senior U.S. and European officials will meet to try to find a way to bring Israel and the
Palestinians back to stalled negotiations.
