+ Oni.

1- It looks like we only need call sheet for 5-Gilani per Cameron's email. But can you also incorporate Cameron and Mary
Mitchell's changes to the letter and pass to Dan as the final? Please copy both Oni and me on the call sheet and one of
us will finalize if that happens after you are out of pocket. Thanks!

I will put together our call sheets for Z, G, and N within next couple of hours. Post - I can add in any early input you send
to me, or will send drafts to you.

I need to be away from the computer/house from about 1 to 8 pm today, so would be great if someone else from the
Desk can pick up if there are still edits coming in.

So to briefly review the bidding at 00B EST Sun, as we were in a holding pattern in DC for much of Sat.




                          Does this seem accurate, especially from Post?

What else? Happy to jump on a call if this is easier to discuss by phone, though perhaps email is better given security
concerns.
