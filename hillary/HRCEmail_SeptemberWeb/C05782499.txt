Subject: Egypt PM says peace deal with Israel not sacred-1V (Reuters)


CAIRO (Reuters) - Prime Minister Essam Sharaf said Egypt's peace deal with Israeli was not sacred and was
always open to discussion or change if that would benefit the region or enhance peace, speaking in an interview
with a Turkish television channel.

   "The Camp David agreement is not a sacred thing and is always open to discussion with what would benefit
the region and the case of fair peace ... and we could make a change if needed," he said in the interview, which
was also broadcast on Egyptian state television.
