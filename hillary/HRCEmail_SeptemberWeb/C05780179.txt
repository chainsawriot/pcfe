Subject: Bahrain takes legal action against main opposition group Wifaq (SBU)

(SBU) The government will seek court approval to dissolve Wafiq, saying the group had violated the
constitution by "undertaking activities that harmed social peace, national unity, and inciting disrespect for
constitutional institutions," media report. Embassy Manama notes this move could be a prelude to the arrest of
additional Wifaq leaders, and the government may also take action against smaller political entities.
