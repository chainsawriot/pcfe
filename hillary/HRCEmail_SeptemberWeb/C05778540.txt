Subject: The COM Conference

Cheryl: it's a great and valuable series of events, but I wanted to mention in particular how moved I was by Roy Spence
â€” whom I don't think I'd ever met during my tenures with President Clinton. He even managed to move the
Ambassadors, at least 2-3 of whom told me they began listening with more than a little skepticism, but were ultimately
won over. Best, Eric
