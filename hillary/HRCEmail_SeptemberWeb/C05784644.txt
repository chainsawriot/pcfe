You are seated next to Prince Philips new private secretary Archie Miller-Bakewell.
Sir Miles, who is 72 on Sunday, will be replaced by Brig Archie Miller-Bakewell. The new private secretary, who will no
doubt do his best to keep up with Prince Philip, 89, is not afraid of controversy. He is said to have inspired the successful
campaign to free two Scots Guards jailed for killing a teenager in Northern Ireland in 1992
