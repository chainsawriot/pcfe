Cheryl,
As you may recall, I am in Bamako, Mali and thus, watching events from afar. Please let the Secretary know that she- and
the Department- is doing an extraordinary job in unprecedented circumstances. I can only begin to imagine forces at
work in Egypt, Yemen, Jordan Tunisia and many countries beyond- some heartening and amazing, some nefarious and
very dangerous. Take care as best you can.
Wendy
