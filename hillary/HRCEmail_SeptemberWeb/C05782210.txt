CDM â€”

I came down to see you but your door was closed. In answer to your question:

     (1) According to the MCC Bylaws, "any action required or permitted to be taken by the Board at a meeting may be
         taken without a meeting if consent in writing, setting for the action so taken, is signed by a quorum of the Board
        UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05782210 Date: 09/30/2015

        then serving. Any member of the Board may request that a telephonic meeting of the Board be held in advance
        of such written action."


     (2) According to the MCC Bylaws, "the vote of the majority of those attending any meeting at which a quorum is
        present shall constitute an action of the board" (quorum is a majority of the members of the board, including at
        least one private board member. current board membership is 4 USG + 2 private).
