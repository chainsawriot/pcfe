Subject: Lawyers press demands in Mubarak security head trial (Reuters)

CAIRO, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Lawyers called on Egypt's government on Sunday to hand over documents that
may reveal who ordered police to fire on protesters during the uprising that unseated President Hosni Mubarak,
leaving more than 850 people dead.

  The demand came during the trials of Egypt's reviled former Interior Minister Habib el-Adli and deposed
Mubarak over the killings, which have captivated Egyptians with real-life drama to trump the most popular
Ramadan-season TV soap operas.

   Adli was in charge of a massive security apparatus blamed for systematic rights abuses and the smothering
of all opposition to Mubarak's 29-year rule.

   The ex-minister and six of his lieutenants, who are charged with the killings and corruption, watched from
the court's steel cage on Sunday as dozens of lawyers for the plaintiffs jostled towards the judge's bench to list
their demands.

    All seven defendants face the death penalty if convicted over the killings.

    Tension pervaded the busy courtroom.

   Security men struggled to keep order as the family of a dead protester scuffled with relatives of a dead police
officer whose photo was held up to commemorate his death.

    The protester's family demanded that the photo be removed, saying the officer was a killer not a victim.

  "The judge abruptly ended the session which got out of hand because of over-enthusiasm and rising
emotions," Gameel Saeed, representing one top officer accused with Adli, told Reuters.

    Judge Mimed Refaat set the next hearing for Sept. 5. Mubarak's trial resumes on Monday.
