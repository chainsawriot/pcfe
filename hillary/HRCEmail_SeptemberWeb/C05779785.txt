We did not get to discuss this yesterday but I wanted to bring you up to speed on an issue that is brewing between BBG
and DRL. As you know DRL received $50 million for internet freedom related initiatives. Last year they received and
dispersed $20 million in the form of small grants to a variety of institutions involved in these issues. They also
transferred $1.5 million to BBG which BBG used to fund research in circumvention technology.
