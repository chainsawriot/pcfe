Subject: Scottish police question Koussa over Lockerbie (Reuters)


LONDON (Reuters) - Scottish police interviewed defecting Libyan foreign minister Moussa Koussa on
Thursday over the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, Scottish prosecutors said.
   U.S and Scottish authorities hope Koussa, Libya's former spy chief, will provide vital military and
diplomatic intelligence on the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
   "We can confirm that officers of Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary... today met Mr Moussa Koussa in
relation to the ongoing investigation into the Lockerbie bombing," a spokesman for the Crown Office said.
