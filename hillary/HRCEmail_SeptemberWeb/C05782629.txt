Subject: Gaddafi loyalists say inflict heavy casualties on foes (Reuters)



CAIRO (Reuters) - Muammar Gaddafi loyalists have inflicted heavy losses on fighters of Libya's new rulers in
Bani Walid and are prepared for a long fight, a spokesman for Gaddafi said on Friday in audio comments
broadcast on a Syria-based television station.

  "The battle is far from over," Moussa Ibrahim told Arrai television. "We have prepared ourselves for a long
war. We have the equipment and the weapons," he said.

    Many anti-Gaddafi fighters were killed or captured in Bani Walid, he said.
