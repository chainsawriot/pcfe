Already spoke to the PM designee Rouzier (not clear he also will make it through parliament). My observation is that he
is out ahead of MuteIly, which he acknowledges.

In particular, he said he didn't say what was quoted in AP; that said, Rouzier would like IHRC to be more effective and
wants to have discussion with WJC and Martelly to figure out how to do better. He advised that he has not coordinated
or yet discussed what is recommendation for how to increase effectiveness — his team is in the process of drafting that
recommendation/position paper for discussion with WJC and MuteIly for their input and guidance).

earthquake reconstruction commission co-chaired by former U.S. President Bill Clinton. Daniel-Gerard
Rouzier says the 27-member commission is "dysfunctional" and has failed to accomplish much reconstruction.
Rouzier said he would replace the commission with a government agency. The commission was established
after the January 2010 earthquake because international donors wanted assurances that reconstruction would be
orderly and free of the corruption that has long plagued Haiti. But it has been criticized for its slow progress.
