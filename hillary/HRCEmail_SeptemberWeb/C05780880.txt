Yes. Pretty big explosion. Terrorism suspected but no confirmation yet. Two confirmed dead; other casualties but still
waiting on count. PM was nearby but is safe. Amb White is out of town but we have spoken with charg√© and asked
White to get back to Oslo. He will express condolences on TV.
Recommend you reach out to Store. Reminder -- he has asked to come see you in DC in August.
Will keep you posted as we get more.
