To follow up on a conversation Jake had with you about regional media at the end of this week's MEPP, we're
recommending that at the end of Thursday or Friday morning before you leave DC that you do two TV interviews: one
Israeli (likely Channel 2), and one with Al Jazeera. If you're open to it, we could try something creative and have both
interview you at same time. They'll likely balk but worth a try just for the symbolism
