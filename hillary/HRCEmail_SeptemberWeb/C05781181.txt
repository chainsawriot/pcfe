Subject: First Afghan security handover phase finishes (Reuters)

PARAKH (Reuters) - NATO troops handed over security responsibility to Afghan forces in the northeastern
province of Panjshir on Sunday, capping an initial transition phase early after it was deemed a ceremony was
not needed to mark Afghan control of districts around Kabul.

  President Hamid Karzai announced in March that most of the districts in Kabul province, which shares a
name with the country's capital city, would be among seven regions where the NATO-led International Security
Assistance Force (ISAF) would transition security control to Afghan forces in July.

   But Aslu.af Ghani, chairman of the security transition and a former Afghan finance minister, said on Sunday
there would be no official handover ceremony for the Kabul districts because Afghan forces had effectively
been responsible for the area since 2008 when ISAF handed over security control of Kabul city.
