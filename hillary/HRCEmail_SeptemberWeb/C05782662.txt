Subject: US 'outraged after veto of Syria resolution-Rice (Reuters)

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice said Washington was
outraged that the Security Council Tuesday failed to approve a resolution condemning Syria and hinting that it
could face sanctions.

   She told the 15-nation body after Russia and China vetoed a European-drafted resolution on Syria that it was
time for the Security Council to adopt "tough targeted sanctions" on Damascus for its crackdown on pro-
democracy demonstrators.

    "The crisis in Syria will stay before the Security Council and we will not rest until this council rises to meet
its responsibilities," she said
