EGYPTIAN SECURITY FORCES RAID AL-JAZEERA AFFILIATE


(SBU) The raid elicited allegations of a broad media crackdown by Egypt's Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF)
following the ransacking of the Israeli Embassy, according to press. Embassy Cairo comments while the channel is well

criticism since the beginning of the revolution. (Ops/Embassy Cairo e-mail, The New York Times)
