BENGHAZI (Reuters) - Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade appealed to Libyan leader Qadhafi on Thursday
to step down, and offered to help ease his former ally's exit from power.

   "It is in your own interest and the interest of all the Libyan people that you leave power in Libya and never
dream of coming back to power," Wade said during a visit to the rebel-held east Libyan city of Benghazi.

    "I can be one of those who help you pull out of political life and the sooner you leave the better, to save the
lives of Libyans," Wade said.
