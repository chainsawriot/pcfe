 Cheryl,

 Could you please intervene with the people making arrangements for the Secretary's trip to
 Turkey next week?




                                                                                                      B1
                                                                                                      1.4(D)




 Your help on this important issue is greatly appreciated.

  thank you,

 Andy

  P.S.                                                                                                  B1
                         you can share with them the attached letter to the President that is being     1.4(D)
  circulated for signature on Capitol Hill and has already been signed by 62 Senators and 205
  House Members. Many more will sign it before it is sent.
