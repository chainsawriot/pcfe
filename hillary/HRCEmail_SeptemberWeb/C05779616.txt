KANDAHAR, Afghanistan, April 3 (Reuters) - Two policemen were killed and 20 people wounded in the
southern Afghan city of Kandahar on Sunday during the second day of violent protests in the city against the
burning of a Koran by a radical fundamentalist U.S. pastor, a senior official said.

    "The information I have is that two policemen have been killed and 20 others including police, protesters and
citizens, have been wounded," Ahmad Wali Karzai, head of the Kandahar provincial council, told Reuters.

   Another 14 people, including two children, were wounded when a gas cannister taken from a shop was set
on fire, causing an explosion, the spokesman for the Kandahar provincial governor said.
