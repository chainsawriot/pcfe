Patton Boggs just released a statement that they got 10,000 for one project with the Embassy and Egypt is not a client.
So no conflict after all.

This frame survived the briefing. The only question outside the frame was whether we knew Egypt was a client. My
answer was, we know Frank Wisner without feeding it further. The "uniquely positioned" aspect was broadly viewed as
credible. We'll be dancing about this for a couple of days. I refused to engage on the question of conflict of interest,
which was good advice.
