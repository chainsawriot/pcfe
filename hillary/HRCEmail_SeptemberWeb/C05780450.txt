Subject: North, south Sudan leaders to hold Abyei talks (Reuters)

KHARTOUM, June 11 (Reuters) - The leaders of north and south Sudan will meet in Ethiopia on Sunday to
discuss the disputed Abyei region and other issues in the build-up to the south's secession, Sudan's state media
said on Saturday.

   Sudan's President Omar Hassan al-Bashir and south Sudan's President Salva Kiir will meet in Addis Ababa
"to review the pending issues, especially the situation in Abyei", Sudan's state news agency SUNA said.

   Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and former South African President Thabo Mbeki will also
participate in the talks, SUNA said.
