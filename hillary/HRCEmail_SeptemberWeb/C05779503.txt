Colombian President Santos will chair an open debate on Haiti Wednesday April 6. Latin American countries
(Brazil as UNSC member; Argentina, Chile, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Peru, and Uruguay as Friends of Haiti)
are participating at the Ministerial level. The Latin Americans are expected in their statements to call for the
United Nations to expand MINUSTAH into a "development mission," and to make MINUSTAH take a more
active coordinating role in Haiti's economic recovery.
                                                                                                                   B5
