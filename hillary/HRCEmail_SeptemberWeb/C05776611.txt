Todd--

 First, thank you for your success at Cancun. It was certainly hard won! You played the hand you were dealt superbly
and we are. all the better for it. I would like a full debrief when you have the time this week.

  I am on the way to Canada for a US-Can-Mex trilateral and will praise Mexico and Patricia both privately and publicly--
they earned it and saved the international process.

 I'd like to thank your entire team again so we'll work to set up a convenient time. Until then, I hope everybody gets
some well-deserved rest.

 All the best, H
