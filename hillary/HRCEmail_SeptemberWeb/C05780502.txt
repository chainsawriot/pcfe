Subject: Ecuador

I met with Ambassador Gallegos this morning to inform him that he had been P&G'd as a reciprocal action for the
unjustified expulsion of Amb Hodges.                                                                                  B1
                                                                                                                      1.4(D)

We immediately reached out to the press to explain why we took this action. I also spoke to FM Maria Angela Holguin
(Colombia) and FM Jose Antonio Garcia (Peru) to brief them on this step and encouraged them to reach-out to the
Ecuadorans to ask them to refrain from escalating matters.

Holguin has a previously planned meeting in Quito next week-- and was going to speak to FM Patin° about that--she
agreed to raise the issue. Garcia Belaunde will ask President Garcia to call Correa and advise him to moderate his
statements and seek a constructive way forward.

Both will convey the message that the Ecuadorans cannot say, as they have in some of their comments, that "Ecuador
has excellent relations with the United States," while taking the unwarranted step of expelling the US Ambassador.
