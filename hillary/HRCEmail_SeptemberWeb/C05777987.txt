CAIRO (AP) - Moammar Gadhafi's forces have opened fire on mourners at the funeral for anti-government
protesters in the city of Benghazi, where a doctor says at least 200 people have already been slain in days of
demonstrations.
   A man shot in the leg Sunday said marchers were bearing coffins to a cemetery when they passed a Gadhafi
compound in Libya's second-largest city. The man said security forces fired in the air and then opened up on the
crowd. A hospital official says four people have been wounded, two seriously.
   The latest violence follows a day of brutal violence Saturday. Witnesses told The Associated Press a mix of
special commandos, foreign mercenaries and Gadhafi loyalists assaulted demonstrators with knives, assault
rifles and heavy weapons. Those protesters also were at a funeral.
