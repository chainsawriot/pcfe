KHARTOUM (Reuters) - At least 20,000 people have fled Sudan's Abyei region to Agok in the south after the
northern army seized the disputed area, the United Nations said on Tuesday.
   "We don't know exact figures... Around 20,000 are in Agok," said U.N. spokeswoman Hua Jiang, adding
that a U.N. team was assessing the situation on the ground.
