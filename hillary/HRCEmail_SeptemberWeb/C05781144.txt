Subject: New Pakistan foreign min says no need for cajoling on militancy (Reuters)


NUSA DUA (Reuters) - Pakistan's new foreign minister, who held talks July 23 with U.S. Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton, said the two countries shared the strategic objective of combating terror groups and Islamabad
did not need any cajoling on the issue.

   Hina Rabbani Khar, Pakistan's first female and youngest-ever foreign minister, also told reporters on the
sidelines of an Asian security conference that she expected positive results from a meeting with her Indian
counterpart next week, in what could be a major turning point in ties between the two countries since they
resumed peace talks earlier this year.

   Asked if Clinton prodded her on tackling militants operating from within Pakistan, Khar said: "We have the
same strategic objective.

  "Pakistan is the first one to suffer because of terrorism, because of militancy. Pakistan is doing it for itself.
You don't need cajoling on that, that is in our national interest."

   On her talks with Indian Foreign Minister S. M. Krishna scheduled for next Wednesday in New Delhi, Khar
said: "My expectation is to have positive development in our relationship with India."

   It has been a baptism by fire for Khar, who was appointed to the post just this week, after five months as
junior foreign minister. Besides Clinton, she also met Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi on the sidelines of
the security forum in Indonesia.
