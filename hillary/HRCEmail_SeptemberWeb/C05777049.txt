See S has requested to speak to Ashton. Assume it's about NATO-EU stuff, but on Iran, latest is that letter from Jalili's
office to Ashton today was pretty vacuous â€” no firm answer on dates or venue for 5+1 meeting. Cooper following up
with Iranian Amb in Brussels and Chinese (who thought they had a more specific answer). Par for course.
