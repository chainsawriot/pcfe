I have to share with a comment made at dinner tonight by two friends who I worked with in Reagan Administration.
They are longtime Reaganites who said "I feel safe with Hillary". You have to tell her. We are so fortunate she is where
she is. I know it's so damn hard. I'll pray for her. We need her.

I can't tell you how grateful I am as an American for Hillary's leadership and hard work. Really - it kind of makes me
weepy - and it does make me proud.

XO,
Anita
