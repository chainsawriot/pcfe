That is a great practical idea. Thx for sending. I'd like to discuss next week.

Here is the link to the video of The Arc. http://friendsofthearc.org/, a national infrastructure trunkline for a future
Palestinian State developed by the RAND Corporation. It is only 8 minutes long, but a great overview of the Arc vision
and its potential for enabling peace in the region. I promise you it is worth it. It has tested very well with both
Palestinians, Israelis and American Jews and Palestinians. It is a genuinely a transformational idea that did not originate
from American politicians or diplomats, but rather from innovative American minds in collaboration with stakeholders
from all walks of life in Palestine, Israel, the US, Europe, and the Muslim world. And it could be largely financed with
private finance.

Ms. Slaughter,

Again, great talk today at the CNAS annual event. Thanks for your time.

As you will remember, I raised the point that we seem not to be engaging
regimes or populations regarding affirmative visions of what their
societies
could achieve in (say) a decade, if only we invested in a certain
development strategy.

Clearly, you had once heard about the RAND Corporation's Arc Concept
(perhaps from Steve Simon?), for a national infrastructure trunkline for
a
future Palestinian State. To regain familiarity, please watch the 8
minute
video on the home page of www.friendsofthearc.org which provides a great
overview of the Arc vision, and its potential for enabling peace in the
region. This is an affirmative vision that sells very well to both
Palestinians, Israelis and American Jews and Palestinians. I would be
happy
to prove this. Just imagine if the US came out in support of this
vision.

If President Obama simply said something like "The Arc is a great
example of
a transformational idea which did not originate from American
politicians or
diplomats, but rather from innovative American minds in collaboration
with
stakeholders from all walks of life in Palestine, Israel, the US,
Europe,
and the Muslim world. It's the kind of initiative that I am happy to
endorse, and I look forward to better understanding how, through the
Arc,
America can make a positive contributions to peace, prosperity and
security
in the region." - some very interesting things would happen. For
example,
the PIF and other forms of private finance might just finance the whole
thing...not requiring any (or at least much) US $.

You don't know me from Adam, but lets just say that I can say with
confidence that PM Fayyad backs the Arc as a key part of his two year
plan
for statehood, and that Abu Mazen's economic advisor (Dr. Mohammad
Mustafa -
CEO of the PIF) does also. And, that President Peres has been a long
time
supporter (I have the letter on my computer). I happen to know that
Zbigniew Brzezinski will soon be taking a package to NSA Jones on the
topic.
Zbig is a huge fan, as are many others from the establishment. If we
met
for 15 minutes, I could explain the nature of the collective action
problem
that has prevented many Arc fans from speaking up, and I could explain
how I

am fixing this problem.

This is a concrete engagement strategy that would not cost the President
political capital, but would actually manufacture political capital.

If you are willing to talk for 15-20 minutes, I would be happy to run up
to
Foggy Bottom to brief you up on the Arc, and where I plan to take it
over
the next 2 quarters.

Thanks in advance for your interest, and I look forward to getting
together.

Chris
