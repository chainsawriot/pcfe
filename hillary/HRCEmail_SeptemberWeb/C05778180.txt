FYI --


According to Danny Seidemann, Al Jazeera English is going to report within a few hours that they have
received transcripts of negotiating meetings ranging from 1999-2010, including, they claim, of a meeting
between Mitchell and Erekat on October 21 2009 in which Erekat was supposedly willing to give up on
Palestinian sovereignty over the Haram.

Danny agreed to go on Al Jazeera English to discuss Jerusalem issues prior to being made aware of this by
producers; he said he didn't want us to be surprised by the reports.
