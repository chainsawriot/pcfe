Hi Jake

I am out tomorrow and Thursday and since we could not meet today I wanted to relay the following information to you.
(Frank will come by to speak about specifics)

      1- I had a long conversation with the Turkish SRAP in Munich, he is also in charge of Iran and is closely involved in
           their Iran policy.
