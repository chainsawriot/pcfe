Hi Rich,

Congratulations on your very successful work with your hosts to get the hikers out. As you probably know, the
Secretary plans to call the hikers to congratulate them, and possibly invite them to meet with her at a
mutually convenient time. Any color you could provide in this channel about how their stay with you is going,
any details of their experience, and any other pertinent information that the Secretary should know before
 connecting would be very welcome.

 Many thanks,
