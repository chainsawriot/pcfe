Remind me to discuss that her goal is to do cso (who prefer not to do whole thing).

She recommended Tim Carney

Dear Cheryl,

Thanks so much for bringing me into this discussion, which has been my passion (my friends might say obsession) for
many years now. I had a great conversation with Karin today and believe she is absolutely on the right track identifying
core functions. We'll continue our exchange over the weekend, when I'll review and comment on her
Mission/Mandate/Functions overview paper.

Thanks also for our conversation.

Best regards,
Barbara Stephenson

Karin


I had a conversation today with Barbara Stephenson, DCM in London, about thoughts she has re what is necessary to
inspire bureaus to partner with CSO. The Secretary connected with her on one of her last trips and was favorably
impressed by both her commitment to QDDR and willingness to get in the weeds on some of the thornier issues. CSO is
one of those issues.


Will you reach out to her and collaborate with her (share your materials, thoughts, etc) so you all can swap insight and
she can offer support from the standpoint of what we originally wanted an FS0 partner with you to be available to do?


Thanks.


Best.
