Yep. We will be serving in part as a conduit for US ngo's. For example, Henry, who serves on Habitat's board, is bringing
them to Mexico. This is big, not to mention, unprecedented. I'm glad S encouraged us to do this. We would not have
otherwise done so. She needs to take credit at our rollout on 17, May.

> Hi Cheryl & Huma - As you may know, since concluding my Shanghai role, I have been giving my all to building a
Mexican American diaspora project aimed at helping build a civil society infrastructure in Mexico. Along with Henry
Cisneros and Maria Echaveste, who have joined me on the board of the U.S.- Mexico Foundation, we have been
traveling around the country to build support in the Mexican American community for our efforts.

> I am pleased to say that we will publicly launch this project on May 17 with a series of events in DC, including a
national press club event that Henry C. will headline. As you know, our efforts have been inspired by Secy Clinton's
charge to us to find ways to engage in Mexico. Part of the success of our efforts has been our ability to tell people that
Secy Clinton is deeply committed to this project. I truly believe that this is an HRC legacy project. Nothing like this has
ever been attempted in our community. We have been involved in precedent shattering conversations with Mexican
civil society leaders, including the most prominent business leaders. We have reached deep into our pockets to
demonstrate financial commitment. I personally gave $10k to this effort. I am not alone.

> Now the ask: we'd like Secy Clinton to be our lunch keynote on May 17. As I mention, this is her baby - a wonderful
legacy project that she can be proud of. I wish I could say that this is the last time that I'll ever ask for something but I'd
probably be lying. Please try to make this happen. Her key Latino advisors/supporters are leading this.
