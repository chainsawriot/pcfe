Subject: UK PM announces Libya airlift operation (AP)

LONDON - (AP) Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron says the UK has launched an operation to airlift
Egyptian refugees stranded on the Libyan-Tunisian border.
  Cameron says the flights will take Egyptians stranded by the crisis in Libya back to their own country. He
says the first flight is scheduled to leave the UK later Wednesday.
  He says it vital to do this, and that "these people shouldn't be kept in transit camps."
