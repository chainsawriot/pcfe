Subject: Tunisia summons U.S. ambassador over riot comments (AP)

TUNIS (AP) - Tunisia summoned the U.S. ambassador to protest the United States' portrayal of deadly unrest in
this North African nation where riots this weekend killed at least 14 people, the government said. Washington
has expressed concern about Tunisia's handling of more than three weeks of riots over joblessness and other
social ills, during which police have opened fire on rioters several times, while demonstrators have attacked
public buildings and set cars on fire. Last week, U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley urged all sides
to show restraint. He said Tunisians should enjoy the right to protest publicly and expressed worries about a
crackdown on social media in Tunisia. He also said the U.S. summoned the country's ambassador to express its
opinions. Tunisian Foreign Ministry official Saida Chtioui told the U.S. ambassador to Tunis, Gordon Gray, of
authorities' "surprise" at the U.S. reaction, the official TAP news agency said.
