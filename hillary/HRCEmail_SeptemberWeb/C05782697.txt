Subject: Turkish PM Erdogan's mother dies (Reuters)

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish     Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's mother, Tenzile Erdogan, has died in an
Istanbul hospital where she was receiving treatment, state-run Anatolian news agency reported on Friday.

   Turkish media said Erdogan's mother, who was in her 80s, had undergone a gall bladder operation. Her
funeral was expected to be held on Saturday in Istanbul.

    Broadcaster CNN Turk said Erdogan had cancelled a scheduled trip to the western city of Bursa on Saturday.
It was unclear whether he would go ahead with a planned visit to Hatay province on the Syrian border to visit
Syrian refugees on Sunday.
