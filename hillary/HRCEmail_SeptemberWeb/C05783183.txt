Jake Wailes and I have finished negotiating the deauville declaration. We got all we wanted -- especially on our key
principles. We will receive a clean copy from the french shortly and I will send it to you so S can see it before the
meeting tomorrow. We have given the speech writers input to reflect the key points for which we advocated.
Regards,
Bob
