Thanks huma. Am in between rwanda and haiti giving a talk about haiti in, of all places, california. I talked to loune viaud
and the folks receiving you in parc jean-marie vincent (tell the secretary that chelsea has been there with me). Important
for her to know that this is one of the largest spontaneous settlements/camps and we only started working there post-
quake. We wouldve shown you better hospitality in central haiti. Am so sorry to miss you Paul
