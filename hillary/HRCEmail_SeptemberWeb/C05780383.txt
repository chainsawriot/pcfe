Cheryl,

We had a good meeting last week with Jean-Louis, Marriott executives, OPIC, etc regarding building hotels in Haiti — I am
pursuing this vigorously and hope to be able to develop 2 to 3 hotels with Marriott as manager. I am talking with
Commerce and Export/Import Bank today.

Recently at the White House I had a brief discussion with Secretary Clinton
           I do not have a proper email for her. Would you forward the following to ner tor me'?

I will keep you informed about our progress in Haiti — we are going to need all the help we can get.

Thanks,
Dick


Dear Madame Secretary,

We talked briefly at the White House




Thank you for all you're doing for our country and the world.

Fondly,

Dick
