Subject: A Foreign Policy 100 top global thinkers plug for the QDDR

For a tiny bit of good news in such a bleak week, you and President Clinton came in at no. 13 in Foreign Policy's second
annual list of top global thinkers, with special commendation to you for launching the QDDR (and for cookstoves and
women's rights, as well as for your strong position on American leadership). Michele Flournoy and I also tied for no. 74
on the basis of our respective roles in the QDR and other reviews at DoD and the QDDR here at State. Here are the write
ups




13. Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton

for proving that you don't need to be president to act presidential.

Former president I New York

Secretary of State I Washington

Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in September, Hillary Rodham Clinton sounded a confident note
<http://www.state.govisecretary/rm/2010/09/146917.htm> : "After years of war and uncertainty, people are
wondering what the future holds, at home and abroad. So let me say it clearly: The United States can, must, and will
lead in this new century."

Ironically, two of the people most crucial to the new global century are the Clintons themselves: the ex-president and
the ex-would-be-president, the power couple now defined by their position just outside the highest reaches of power.
Except that, these days, both Clintons are more influential, and more beloved, than ever. Bill's Clinton Global Initiative is
starting to feel like a sexier, more effective competitor not just to Davos but to the United Nations itself, bringing world
leaders together to commit their resources to fighting poverty with market-based, technocratic solutions. As of this
summer, his foundation had contributed $23 million and countless man-hours to the effort to rebuild Haiti. Polls have
shown he's a better advocate for Democratic candidates than the actual president, and he spent most of the fall
stumping for woebegone Dems from Orlando to Seattle.

Meanwhile, Hillary showed up in one recent poll as the most popular political figure in the United States, an accolade
she has earned through a no-drama approach to an array of thankless tasks: brushing off Vladimir Putin's temper
tantrum to reach agreement on nuclear disarmament and Iran sanctions, promoting women's rights over the objections

of entrenched traditionalists, and launching an innovative effort to bring clean cookstoves to the world's poorest. But
what she has mainly stood for is American competence, with her Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review a
major, if unglamorous step toward making U.S. statesmanship a more agile beast. If this is what Clinton nostalgia looks
like, bring it on.




74. Michele Flournoy and Anne-Marie Slaughter

for setting the tone of how the United States engages with the world.

Policy planning chiefs, Defense and State Departments I Washington

Barack Obama campaigned in 2008 on the promise of changing not just the style but the substance of how the United
States deals with its allies and enemies abroad, and the job of figuring out how to enact the changes fell largely to two
people in particular. At the State Department, Anne-Marie Slaughter, director of policy planning, is spearheading the
department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. The review aims to rejuvenate marginalized civilian
agencies such as the U.S. Agency for International Development, preparing for a world in which America's worst threats
are not great-power rivals but the upheavals associated with failed and failing states.

Slaughter's Pentagon counterpart is Undersecretary for Policy Michele Flournoy, co-founder of the Center for a New
American Security think tank, who articulated a vision for a new Democratic realism in foreign policy that both
candidates Hillary Clinton and Obama embraced in the 2008 election. In 2010 she oversaw the Pentagon's own
quadrennial review, a blueprint that cuts back on big-ticket weapons systems and focuses instead on the immediate
needs posed by today's asymmetrical conflicts. Flournoy has also been a vocal advocate for Obama's Afghanistan
strategy, albeit a pragmatic one <http://www.voanews.comienglishinews/asia/US-Sees-New-Afghan-Strategy-Working-
85043372.html> : "I don't want to suggest that achieving success will be simple or easy," she told the Senate in February.
"We need to prepare for the possibility that things may get harder before they get better."
