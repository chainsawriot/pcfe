Subject: Turkey charges 14 militants with anti-U.S. plot (AP)

ANKARA (AP) - A court has charged 14 suspected al-Qaida militants for allegedly planning to attack the U.S.
Embassy in the Turkish capital.
   The court in Ankara formally pressed charges against the suspects late Friday. Another suspect was released,
though may later also face trial. The suspects were captured days ahead of the arrival of U.S. Secretary of State
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who in Istanbul.
   The state-run Anatolia news agency said on Saturday that a key suspect had carried out surveillance around
the U.S. Embassy in Ankara and some other foreign missions, including taking photos. It says police have
seized 1500 pounds of chemicals along with bomb-making instructions, assault rifles, ammunition and maps of
Ankara.
