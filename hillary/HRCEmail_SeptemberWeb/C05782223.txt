Subject: France, Britain to meet Libyan opposition in Paris (AP)


PARIS (AP) - The leaders of France and Britain have invited Libyan rebels to attend a conference in Paris next
week to discuss how the international community can support Libya's new government.
  The conference will be held Sept. 1.
  A statement from Prime Minister David Cameron's office said the meeting would be an opportunity to set out
how "the international community can help (the rebels) on the path to establishing a free, democratic and
inclusive Libya."
