Here is Bill's take:

As we discussed, these points work well. Balance is clear between Doha (strong public msg of political resolve, broad
private understanding among key players on c'f/transition elements) and Berlin (strongest possible articulation of
military mission and serious private discussion of assistance/training). As Jim rightly points out, need some USG
decisions on latter issues before we can effectively move others.

Before I hit send on this to outsiders, I wanted to check whether that would be okay - I suppose I can just pass it off as
my personal work.
