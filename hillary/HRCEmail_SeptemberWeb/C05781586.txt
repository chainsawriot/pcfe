â€¢PARIS - (AP) France's president says he will advocate a Palestinian state if peace talks with Israel don't get
 restarted by September.
    Nicholas Sarkzoy is quoted by the weekly magazine L'Express as saying that if talks between Israel and the
 Palestinians don't resume over the summer, France will help promote international recognition of a Palestinian
 state.
    Palestine has been recognized as an independent state by scores of nations, but not by the United States and
 most European countries. Palestinian diplomats have said they plan to ask the U.N. General Assembly for
 recognition in September.
    Sarkozy's comments came a day after a reconciliation agreement between the two main Palestinian factions.
    Sarkozy is expected to discuss the possibility of a Palestinian state in a meeting with Israel's Prime Minister
 Benjamin Netanyahu in Paris on Thursday.
