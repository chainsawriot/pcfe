I'd heard about this New Yorker item but hadn't read it. Remarkable.

I thought the Goldberg interview was pretty interesting. Definitely a little more academic in tone than say, People
Magazine. But yes, Jeff does like to talk and offer his own narrative. He's actually a good guy though and he's a fan so I
think this piece will be good.

Fyi. Also, what did you think of interview yesterday? He certainly has his own take no matter what I might say! From:

make you proud Think of this during all those tough times: Dexter Filkins has a major piece on yemen in the new yorker
and has this on Tarrokol Karman, a Yemen woman who has been the leader among the protestors in Yemen.
A few days later, I visited Karman's house, in central Sanaa. On the mantel in the sitting room were framed photographs
of four people: Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, and Hillary Clinton. Karman had met Clinton in
January, just before the uprising began. Her organization, Women Journalists Without Chains, receives funding from the
U.S. government. The meeting with Clinton was arranged by the U.S. Embassy, she said. Looking at the picture of
Clinton, she added, "I don't want to be foreign minister, but she is my role model."
