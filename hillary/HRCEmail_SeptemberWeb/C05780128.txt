Huma, I shot this to you a few weeks ago, but I know you've had a few extra things going on in addition to the normal
madness. I hope all as well. Please provide me with any guidance you can re: the below proposal.

Thanks, all the best and again congratulations.

Huma,

I hope you are well. Congratulations on your marriage and best wishes for everything wonderful. I am not sure if you are
back from your honeymoon yet, but I thought I would give this a try.

I was hoping to see the Secretary at Dave Stone's service at Arlington last week, but our House is in session and we are
finished at the end of the month, so it is tough to miss votes in an election year. I attended the service at Annapolis
earlier this year.

I tried to get ahold of you a few times before the 4th to pick your brain on a potential proposal. Realizing how busy you
constantly are, I figured an email might have to work for now.



BG Gil Beck, Commander of the US Army Legal Reserve Command in Gaithersburg, MD has asked me to informally
approach Secretary Clinton to gauge interest in the possibilty of a new liason program between the Office of the
Secretary of State and US Army Reserve JAGS.

If there is an interest, the basic proposal would be for the Legal Command to periodically cut orders placing a Reserve
JAG on active duty and assigned to the Office of the Secretary of State to observe operations there.

The benefits to the JAG Corps are many fold. As we have all been told, the ultimate tool of American foreign policy is the
military. In today's deployed environment, commanders at every level rely heavily on JAG advice for everything from
rules of engagement to negotiations with local leaders and other armed forces. For an officer to have observed the
making and implementation of American foreign policy at this level, and then be able to return and share this
experience with his colleagues could be potentially invaluable.

The Army Reserve has become a full partner in our nation's military strategy, and the JAG Corps is a central prong in
that. Reserve JAGs bring a tremondous variety of life, civilian and military experience when placed on active duty.

The benefits to the DOS would be shared experience and a different perspective. Building a pool of officers who have
been exposed to the workings of the Office of the Secretary could provide long term benefits, including but not limited
to easing bureaucratic tension between the military and civilian staff down range. A great majority of reserve JAGs have
been in deployed environments and could impart lessons learned during those duties. The JAG Liason could complement
DOS Staff without affecting DOS budget or personnel requirements.

Every JAG has a least a secret, if not top secret clearance. Legal Command personnel strength is about 1,600 soldiers and
paralegals, all with diverse capabilities. A number of Reserve JAGs currently serve the DOS in civilian capacities.

The length of assignment could be anywhere from a month to six months to a year, varying with the duties assigned. The
proposal would be that I could be the first officer assigned to act as a template or test case to determine the potential
success of this program. Possible start date could be this coming January.

If the program proved successful, it could be expanded to other services. We are, after all, often working in a purple
environment.

I realize these are very preliminary details, but it would be greatly appreciated if you could give me some thoughts as to
the possibility of implementation of this program and the forwarding of a formal proposal to the Secretary.

I can always be reached at

Thank you for your time and I hope you are enjoying the summer.

Hank Naughton
