KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan lawmakers have accepted President Hamid Karzai's offer to inaugurate parliament
next week, they said late Janaury 22, ending a standoff that had thrown the country into political turmoil. "We
have agreed on Karzai's request to open parliament on Wednesday and refrain from going to parliament
tomorrow," said Sediq Ahmad Usmani, a representative from Parwan province.
