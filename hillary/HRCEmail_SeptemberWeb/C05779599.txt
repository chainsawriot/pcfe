    Am sending you a link to a CSCC video that juxtaposes Zawahiri talking about the impossibility of peaceful change
    with scenes of jubilation in Egypt.

    http://www.voutube.com/watch?v=7hKoRJaPk4c

    The Zawahiri quote (which comes from a statement he made in 2008) is as follows:

            "There is no hope to remove the corrupt regimes in Muslim countries except by force, There is no
            chance to bring about change through peaceful action. Let anyone who disagrees give me a single
            example."

.   It's generated over 55,000 hits in the time it has been up and we are looking for ways to push it out farther.

    I think it's really good and the audience seems to agree. Clearly the sort of stuff we need to do in this environment ---
    short, high energy and to the point. Note that there is no music under the Zawahiri clips since he starts his rant with
    "there will be no music". Will keep you posted as we move forward. Let me know what you think.
