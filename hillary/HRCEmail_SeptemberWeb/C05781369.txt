One of my staffers, Peter Mandaville, wrote up the below on the Gene Sharp-Otpor-April 6
movement connections:

Following the uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak in Egypt this past February, some observers
pointed to links between some of the key protest groups and the ideas of Gene Sharp, an
American theorist of nonviolent struggle. More specifically, a February 13 article in the New
York Times detailed a connection between Egypt's April 6 movement and former leaders of
Serbia's civic youth movement Otpor—a group heavily influenced by Sharp's ideas and funded
by the NED, USAID, and IRI. In 2009 the U.S. democracy advocacy group and think tank
Freedom House sponsored a brief visit by several April 6 activists to Serbia to exchange ideas
and receive training in civic mobilization.

      Further reporting in April focused on the Academy of Change (AoC), an organization
based in Qatar founded by three Egyptian expats. AoC trainers had worked with some of the
precursor civic networks in Egypt—such as the Kefaya movement in 2005—again, with a
strong influence from Gene Sharp's writings. April 6 activists also forged ties to the Academy
of Change, establishing a sort of local franchise in Cairo under the guise of the Egyptian
Democratic Academy, which also received USG grants.

      In order to assess the strength and significance of these influences and the role of Gene
Sharp's ideas in the January 25 revolution, several members of the Policy Planning Staff (S/P)
looked into the issue during a recent fact-finding trip to Egypt. They met with representatives of
a wide range of protest groups—including the April 6 movement—major civil society
organizations, and political parties.

       April 6 activists acknowledged the influence of Sharp's ideas, but emphasized that he
was simply one among many thinkers (including Mahatma Ghandi) they had studied. They also
denied the exclusivity of their relationship with Otpor, citing additional mentoring links to
Poland's Solidarity movement, as well as other activists in the Arab world from Lebanon to
Tunisia. Moving beyond the April 6 movement, most of the young protestors with whom my
staff spoke had never heard of Gene Sharp.

       In sum, it appear that Sharp's ideas had a strong influence on one of the "hub" groups
that played a key role in organizing and mobilizing the initial January 25 protests in Egypt.
These events, however, soon took on a momentum that transcended the ability of any one group
to control. The vast majority of Egyptians who participated in the extraordinary eighteen days

that culminated in Mubarak's stepping down on February 11 had never been exposed to Sharp's
ideas.

      In some respects, the earlier reporting on these purported ties to Gene Sharp now seems
somewhat overblown. The NYT, for example, claimed to see Sharp's influence in the
extraordinary organizational discipline evident in the protestors' ability to hold ranks and avoid
violent retaliation when set upon by pro-regime elements in the first few weeks of the
revolution. Most other analysts, however, credit this to the leadership of the Muslim
Brotherhood, which by about the third day of the uprising had taken over responsibility for
securing Tahrir Square and organizing the protest ranks.
