LONDON (AP) â€” A report from British broadcaster Channel 4 says Libya's foreign minister has declared that
Moammar Gadhafi's grip on power is over.

Speaking from a home in Tripoli, Abdul Ati al-Obeidi says he was not in contact with other members of
Gadhafi's regime. He said Wednesday it now appears Gadhafi has exhausted all his options.

Gadhafi's sprawling government compound was stormed by thousands of rebels a day earlier.
