her more detailed recommendations.

Subject: Maritime inspection regime for Gaza

The NYT yesterday indicated Israel's greater willingness to consider something like this; I gather that the WH is thinking
along these lines as well, although on a less multilateral basis. If it is helpful, Dafna is working on another more technical
paper on how to resolve the border/inspection issues within a multilateral framework -- getting into details of what wd
have to be agreed. I have told her to send whatever she has directly to Jake in case I am off email. AM
