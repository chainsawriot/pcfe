Subject: Syria govt must answer for crimes vs humanity-Juppe (Reuters)

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Syria's leaders must answer for crimes against humanity that are being committed in
their crackdown on anti-government protests, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Monday.

 â€¢ "Crimes against humanity are being committed in Syria and the leaders of the regime will have to answer for
them," Juppe said in remarks at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.

    Juppe also said the status quo between Israel and the Palestinians was neither acceptable nor tenable and
"risks an explosion of violence." He said he would meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas later on
Monday.
