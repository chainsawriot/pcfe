 SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED                                             RELEASE IN FULL


                           The Secretary's Call Sheet for
                       Representative Gary Ackerman (D-NY)

 Purpose of Call: Rep. Ackerman is planning to issue a statement on Syria and
 would like to discuss recent events there with you.

 • .Syrian Crackdown: The Syrian government continues to exact brutal reprisals
    against its own citizens resulting in the deaths of hundreds since March. We
    reject the Syrian government's justification of its tactics as necessary to
    maintain'stability." The Asad regime remains the source of instability as it
    foments violence by meeting peaceful protests with deadly force and mass
    arrests.

 • Political Future: The recent events in Syria make it clear that the country
   cannot return to the way it was before. A political transformation is underway,
   and that transformation must lead to democracy and respect for the universal
   rights of the Syrian people. President Asad has a choice: lead this
   transformation or get out of the way.

 • U.S. Policy: The Administration's policy has been consistent in strongly
   condemning violence and arrests against peaceful protestors, while urging the
   Syrian government to respect the legitimate demands of its citizens. President
   Obama has signed an executive order imposing targeted sanctions against
   individuals and entities, and we have led the international community in calling
   a Special Session on Syria at the UN Human Rights Council and in pressuring
   Syria to with draw its candidacy for the council.

 • Path Ahead: While it is essential that we hold all those who commit human
   rights abuses to account, it is also vital that we do not get ahead of the Syrian
   people. Syria is a multi-confessional society with substantial minority
   communities that fear a sectarian conflict. Our actions moving forward must
   seek to avoid a worst-case post-Asad scenario featuring prolonged instability,
   sectarian bloodletting, and the possible influx of extremists leading eventually
   to a Sunni-dominated, likely Muslim Brotherhood-friendly regime. This would
   not only be a humanitarian disaster, it would also pose an existential threat to
   Israel and could turn back the fragile gains that have been made in Iraq.

    (If Raised) Ambassador Ford: Since the unrest began, Ambassador Ford has
    played a vital role in obtaining the release of several American citizens who

    were detained by the Syrian security services and provided invaluable insights
    into the thinking of senior regime figures and opposition leaders. The media
    blackout in Syria has made the importance of reliable diplomatic reporting
    paramount.

 Background: Rep. Ackerman, Ranking Member of the HFAC Middle East
 subcommittee, is planning to put out a statement regarding Syria and would like to
 discuss recent events there with you. Rep. Ackerman was unable to attend the
 HFAC hearing last week on Middle East issues, where much of the discussion
 focused on Syria and concerns about the Administration response. However, many
 of the other members at the hearing railed about the Syrian crackdown and the
 numbers of demonstrators killed and expressed concern that the Administration
 response is not forceful enough, themes Ackerman's staff has also raised.

 Call Notes:
