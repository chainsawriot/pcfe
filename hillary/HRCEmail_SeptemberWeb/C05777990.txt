TEHRAN (AP) - In an apparent attempt to discourage protesters, an Iranian pro-government news agency
claimed on Sunday that armed opposition groups plan to fire on people participating in a rally set for Sunday
afternoon.
   The report from the hardline Fars news agency said that teams from the Mujahedeen Kimlq, an Iraq-based
Iranian opposition group, have entered the country to shoot people during the protest.
   Iran's opposition has called for a rally Sunday to mark a week since the deaths of two people in Feb. 14
clashes between security forces and opposition protesters in Tehran. The opposition maintains the dead were
killed by government forces.
