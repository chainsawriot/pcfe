Subject:                          Moratorium



Can you ask SEMP/NEA to put together a chronology of the path to the morarat last year--especially all that we did?
Maybe one already exists but I need as much detail as possible. If we can get an outline, Jeff and Dan (who both seem to
have vivid memories) can add to it. Thx.
