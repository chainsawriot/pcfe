Background: The Cambodian government has proposed an NGO law that would impose
mandatory, burdensome registration requirements and could allow arbitrary and selective
criminalization or closure of NGOs. This would have a drastic impact on international NGOs
and their many local development partners, and threatens to muzzle local advocacy and human
rights organizations. The Department and Embassy Phnom Penh have repeatedly urged
Cambodia to reassess the necessity of such a law and to enter into serious consultations with
local NGOs and other stakeholders. The current draft, released to civil society groups in Phnom
Penh in late July, retains most of the objectionable provisions from earlier drafts, despite
consultations with NGOs and extensive diplomatic pressure. The Ministry of Interior, after
consulting with Prime Minister Hun Sen, forwarded the draft to the Council of Ministers
(CoM) for its review. Once approved, the law would move to debate in the legislature, where
we expect it to be quickly approved with no changes. While there is no fixed timetable for
CoM consideration of the law, the process could move quickly. We are coordinating our
strategy and messaging with the EU, UN, UK, Canadian, and German missions in Phnom
Penh.
