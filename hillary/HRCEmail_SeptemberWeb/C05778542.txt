Hillary,
You cannot imagine how many people come up to me when I am traveling (have been in Oregon for 3 days), from my ski
instructor to professors to taxi drivers to Republicans, to tell me what a spectacular job they think you are doing and
how much better they feel knowing that you are representing the country. It is quite amazing. They see how hard you
are working and they are grateful and admiring. Good luck this week.
AM
