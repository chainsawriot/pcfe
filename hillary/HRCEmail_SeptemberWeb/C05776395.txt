You and president Obama now support the Colombia Free Trade agreement!

Hope you are well. I remain amazed at the schedule you are running.

                                                                                                                              B6

We did at least get ADM to contribute to shanghai -- always happy to help on projects like that, earlier the better.




The midterms are likely to be brutal, that is for sure. Around the world the financial crises and it's repercussions are
creating problems on the edge of insolvable in the long run. Putting aside the irony of the Colombia Free Trade
agreement, the administration has an inadequate plan for long- term innovation and growth -- the only real ways to
solve the debt. That was the real lesson of 96 to 98 when wjcs plans came to fruition to create a surplus.

Thanks again. Take care.
