Dear Cheryl, Tom and Joe

Today the will of the Haitian people expressed at the voting booth on March 20th has been respected by the CEP.
Albeit a protracted process the decisive victory 67% of the vote cannot be ignored.

Both candidates must be celebrated for encouraging their supporters to show restraint over the course of the past
week.

Upon the concession of Mrs. Manigat we must encourage President-Elect Martelly to use this significant moment at the
dawn of his government to pull the Haitian people together and work towards ONE Haiti.

This moment will not come again and it will signal the type of government he intends to lead.

All of us in the diaspora must now put aside our personal politics and come together for the simple but noble purpose
of building a better Haiti.

God bless the people of Haiti may the hope they have placed in this process and this President-Elect be realized.



Warm Regards,

Marie St. Fleur
Chief Advocacy & Strategic Investments,
City of Boston
