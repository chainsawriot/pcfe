Subject: Trial opens for pro-reform activists in Emirates (AP)


ABU DHABI (AP) - Court officials say five activists have gone on trial on security-related charges as part of a
crackdown on political dissent in the United Arab Emirates.
   The closed-door proceedings June 14 in Abu Dhabi's Federal Supreme Court comes after international
watchdog groups, including human rights groups, criticized the arrests.
   The UAE has not faced street protests inspired by the Arab uprisings, but authorities have moved
aggressively to silence pro-reform advocates. Among the five arrested are a prominent blogger and a frequent â€¢
lecturer at the Abu Dhabi branch of Paris' Sorbonne university.
   Before the trial opened, pro-government supporters staged a rally outside the court to denounce the suspects
as traitors.
