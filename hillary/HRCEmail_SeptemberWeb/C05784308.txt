Subject: China denies Pakistan gave it helicopter access (AP)

BEIJING - (AP) China's Defense Ministry says media reports that Pakistan gave it access to a radar-evading
helicopter that crashed during the U.S. mission to kill Osama bin Laden are "preposterous."
   The Financial Times reported Sunday that Pakistan allowed Chinese military engineers to photograph and
take samples of the stealth chopper before giving it back to the U.S.
   In its first public response, China's Defense Ministry said in a one-line statement late Tuesday: "This report is
baseless and preposterous."
   The U.S. suspects that Pakistan shared the technology with China in retaliation for its May 2 raid that killed
bin Laden on Pakistani soil.
   Pakistan has denied the charge.
