Subject: NATO cannot confirm civilian casualties in Libya (AP)

 TRIPOLI (AP) - NATO said Saturday it cannot confirm a Libyan government claim that 11 Muslim clerics
were killed in an airstrike in eastern Libya but regrets "any loss of life by innocent civilians" whenever it
occurs.
   NATO has been intensifying airstrikes against Gadhafi's troops in several areas of Libya in a bid to weaken
his brutal crackdown against a rebel uprising. Four explosions _ most likely from NATO strikes _ were heard in
Tripoli early Saturday.
   On Friday, the government accused the alliance of killing the 11 clerics as they were sleeping in a
guesthouse. Government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said those killed were part of a group that had gathered to
pray for peace in the oil town of Brega. He said 50 people also were wounded, including five in critical
condition.
   In a statement Saturday, NATO said the building struck had been "clearly identified as a command and
control center." It said it could not confirm civilian deaths but did not deny them either.
