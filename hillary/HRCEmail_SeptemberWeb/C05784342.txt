Subject: US, Chinese basketballers brawl during Biden visit (AP)


BEIJING (AP) - A bench-clearing brawl at an exhibition game between American and Chinese basketball teams
has marred the orchestrated harmony of U.S. Vice President Joe Biden's visit to China.
   The fight between the Georgetown University men's basketball team and the Bayi Rockets on Thursday night
in Beijing forced the game to end early. On Wednesday, Biden watched the Georgetown Hoyas play another
Chinese team. Biden did not attend Thursday's game.
   Georgetown head coach John Thompson III said in a statement that the two teams "played a very competitive
game that unfortunately ended after heated exchanges with both teams." He said Georgetown regretted the
incident.
   The Georgetown Hoyas are in China on a goodwill trip.
