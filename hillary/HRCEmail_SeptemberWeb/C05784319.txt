Subject: UN says withdraws non-essential staff from Syria (Reuters)




BEIRUT (Reuters) - The United Nations has withdrawn non-essential staff from Syria where President Bashar
al-Assad is seeking to crush a five-month uprising against his rule, a senior U.N. official said on Wednesday.

   U.N. Special Coordinator for Lebanon Michael Williams said in a statement to Reuters that the 26 non-
essential international staff members and their families had left Syria.

   Williams also said he was "very concerned" at the situation in Latakia, where activists say 36 people have
been killed in a military assault which was launched against parts of the coastal city on Saturday.
