Just flagging this piece for everyone.

USAID'S SHAH: "HARD DECISIONS" TO BE MADE AMID BUDGET CUTS. In an interview with Reuters (1/20, Quinn), USAID
Administrator Rajiv Shah said he plans to cut millions as the Administration looks to make budget cuts and as the agency
seeks to restructure itself. "We're making those hard decisions and tough changes," Shah told Reuters. "We need our
partners on the Hill in both parties to recognize that, done well, development saves lives and improves economic
opportunities, and needs to be elevated and not cut," he added. Shah argued that administrative changes save about
$65 million in operating expenses, adding, "We're actually embarking on perhaps the most aggressive operational
reform of a major federal bureaucracy. If we get the support for it, we will save American taxpayers hundreds of millions
of dollars over time."
