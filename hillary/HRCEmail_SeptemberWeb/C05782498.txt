Subject: Arabs to avoid targeting Israel at UN atom meeting (Reuters)


VIENNA (Reuters) - Arab states will refrain from targeting Israel over its assumed nuclear arsenal at a global
meeting of U.N. atomic agency member countries next week, diplomats said on Thursday, an unexpected
gesture of restraint sure to be welcomed by the West.

   It would be a rare conciliatory move in the volatile Middle East, where Israeli-Arab tension has risen in
recent weeks over a pending Palestinian bid for statehood recognition at the United Nations later this month, a
move opposed by Washington.

   A senior Arab diplomat said the decision not to single out Israel was designed to give "more room" for two
planned meetings to succeed -- an International Atomic Energy Agency-hosted forum in November on nuclear
weapons-free zones, to be attended by Arab states and Israel, and an Egyptian-proposed conference in 2012 to
discuss creating such a zone in the Middle East.

  "Why not give it a chance?" the Arab envoy said. The decision was taken at an Arab foreign ministers
meeting in Cairo this week and it was a "very tough" one to make, he said.

   Two Arab envoys accredited to the IAEA told Reuters the change of plan should be seen as a "confidence-
building measure" and "good gesture from Arab states" to foster wider efforts to create a Middle East free of
nuclear weapons.
