Johnnie Carson 8/22 Calls with AU Chairperson Ping and PSC Commissioner Lamamra

On August 22, Assistant Secretary Carson spoke separately with African Union (AU) Chairperson Jean Ping and
Chairperson of the AU Commissioner for Peace and Security Ramtane Lamamra to urge the AU to press the South
African Government to support lifting immediately the freeze on $1.5 billion in Libyan assets, to be used for
humanitarian purposes.                                                                                                   1 .4(D)'
                                                                                                                         B1

Key Points




        Ping and Lamamra indicated that the AU supports democratic transition in Libya

        Lamamra warned of Islamist influence in the INC military units spearheading the assault on Tripoli

Ping                                      Looks to Future

Urging the AU Chairperson to use his good offices to push South Africa to support lifting the asset freeze, A/S Carson
underscored to Ping that the assets would be used for much needed fuel, food and other humanitarian assistance for
the Libyan people, and that delays in releasing this assistance could cause serious harm. The Assistant Secretary
highlighted that the changed circumstances of the past 48 in Libya present an opportunity for the AU to join
international consensus, assist the Libyan people, and hasten Qadhafi's departure.




               A/S Carson reiterated that Ping should nonetheless advise the South Africans

before the AU meetings to address the asset freeze immediately,



Ping sounded eager to move to discussions beyond the asset freeze and Qadhafi's imminent departure, insisting "The
main issue is now solved. We had wanted to convince Qadhafi to leave quietly but now its over, and we have to deal
with the future." On Libya's post-Qadhafi transition, Ping strongly suggested that the AU would find a great deal of
common ground with the international community. Ping said "Everything the AU proposed in our roadmap is consistent
with what the Transitional National Council (TNC) is saying, including reconciliation, constitutional reform and
democratic elections." A/S Carson underscored that the AU use this opportunity to issue a strong, positive statement
that it stands by the Libyan people in their democratic transition, and that Qadhafi's time has passed. The AU should
work with the UN and the international community and should not get caught on the wrong side of history on this issue
again.

 Lamamra Also Looks to Future, Warns of Islamist Influence in Transition

The A/S underscored with Lamamra the importance of immediate action by South Africa in lifting the asset freeze, and
repeated that the AU should reach out to South Africa now. The A/S pressed for positive statements from the AU and a
cooperative and collaborative approach with the TNC, the international community and international organizations to
ensure democratic transition and stability in Libya. The A/S noted emphasized that democratic progress in Africa
continues to move forward, the era of strongmen is in decline


Speaking of the post-Qadhafi era, Lamamra said "we are reading from the same book." Lamamra added that the AU all
along has wanted to see peaceful democratic transition in Libya, and noted the need for an inclusive process that avoids
chaos and civil war. Lamamra cautioned that "Islamist" brigades were the first INC elements into Tripoli, and that that
international community should be forewarned that some of these elements may intend to "derail the democratic
project." A/S Carson underscored that the AU must help head off internal fissures in Libya and the TNC and assist the
Libyan people in achieving their aspirations for openness and democracy.
