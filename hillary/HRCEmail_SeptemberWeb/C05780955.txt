Subject: Abyel follow-up

With July 9 South Sudan independence as a press hook this week, we continue to work to get out the Secretary's role in
brokering the Abyei deal:

-- Princeton spoke this morning with Mary Beth Sheridan, WaPo. Sheridan is writing for later this week so hopefully she
will give the Secretary her due.
-- We are reaching out to Alex Perry, a reporter for Time (he also writes for McClatchy) who is reporting from the field
on Sudan, as we try to shape a broader piece.
-- We are backgrounding AP and Reuters + are in contact with our Juba team identifying international press on the
ground so that we can engage with them as well.
-- Re: editorial writers, in addition to his chat with Jackson Diehl, Princeton spoke with NYT's Carol Giacomo last week
and she should produce something for July.9. We are also working to connect with Jerry Seib of WSJ and Doyle
McManus of LAT.
-- Once our delegation for July 9th is announced, we'll do a briefing for our press corps.
-- We'll follow up July 9 with outreach to validators/think-tankers.
