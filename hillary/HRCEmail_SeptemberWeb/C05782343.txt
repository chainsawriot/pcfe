SANAA, March 25 (Reuters) - Yemen's President Ali Abdullah Saleh told thousands of supporters in Sanaa on
Friday that he was prepared to hand over power to save bloodshed but only to what he described as "safe
hands".

    "We don't want power, but we need to hand power over to safe hands, not to sick, resentful or corrupt hands
... We are ready to leave power but only for safe hands," Saleh said in the speech shown on state TV, which
came as tens of thousands of his opponents protested in another part of the capital.

  "We are against firing a single bullet and when we give concessions this is to ensure there is no bloodshed.
We will remain steadfast and challenge them with all power we have."
