Subject: Israeli PM turns to Arab TV in call for peace (AP)

JERUSALEM - (AP) Israel's prime minister has turned to the Arabic media in an attempt to lure the
Palestinians back to peace talks.
   Benjamin Netanyahu's interview with Al-Arabiya TV reflects Israeli jitters ahead of a Palestinian plan to seek
U.N. recognition of independence this fall.
   Netanyahu's office says Thursday's interview reflects the significance he attributes to Arab public opinion.
   Netanyahu has fielded questions from Arabs before on YouTube, but the appearance on Al-Arabiya is his
first face-to-face interview with Arabic media since taking office two years ago.
   In the interview, Netanyahu says "everything is on the table" but offers few new details on his peace plans.
Negotiations have been stalled since September.
