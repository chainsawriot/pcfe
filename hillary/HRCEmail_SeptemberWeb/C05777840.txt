Dear Colleagues:




It has been my great honor, privilege and pleasure to serve as Secretary Clinton's Special Envoy and Coordinator for
International Energy Affairs.




I will miss the camaraderie, commitment and creativity of my foreign and civil service colleagues as I conclude my
service here at State on January 14.

I take great pride in what S/CIEA, with a small but hardy crew and remarkable partners across the US government, has
managed to accomplish to help advance our nation's energy security. Our coverage has been global: I counted 23 trips
to 16 countries in 17 months.




Our Global Shale Gas Initiative (GSGI) is helping enhance diversity of global gas supply and promote less carbon intensive
sources of electricity in India, China, Jordan, Morocco, Poland, with Chile, Uruguay, Ukraine, Hungary and South Africa
on tap for 2011.




Our Energy Governance and Capacity Initiative (EGCI) is helping emerging energy producers in Africa, Latin America and
the South Pacific manage their revenues and their investors wisely, to promote economic development and protect their
environment. These programs will grow in 2011 and 2012.




We helped guide policy reform and power sector design in Pakistan, Haiti and Nigeria, and launched or deepened
binational and strategic dialogues with Nigeria, Angola, Canada, Pakistan and Brazil (biofuels).




Our hard won US-China Joint Statement on Energy Security Cooperation at the 2010 SnED recognizes that our common
interests in markets, open investment, transparent data, reduced fossil fuel subsidies and diversity of supply are the
cornerstone of a relationship based on cooperation rather than competition.




Over time, advances we are pursuing for security of supply with Canada and Mexico, if successful, could mark the most
significant developments in US energy security in decades.




I am also delighted that the Secretary, through the QDDR, has welcomed my suggestion to create a Bureau for
International Energy Affairs to create a long term basis to provide energy diplomacy with the personnel, program and
policy support necessary to pursue this essential agenda. As I noted to the Secretary after the election, when I decided
to return to the private sector, the efforts to fully integrate energy expertise into our bilateral policies, balance our
energy and environmental priorities and make access to electricity a core development priority will be long term efforts.
I believe the new bureau will be the essential cornerstone of the Department's capacity to advance those goals.




I want to thank my team Paul Hueper, Mike Sullivan, Joe Figueiredo, Robert Byla and Brian Mattys for their incredible
support as well as alums Sheila Moynihan, Luvean Myers, Joe Wang and Grant Price.




I am deeply grateful to my program partners at the Department of Interior (USGS, BOEMRE and BLM), Treasury, TDA,
Commerce's CLDP program, FERC, USAID and DoE for giving a deeper appreciation for wisdom, expertise and
commitment of the Federal service and making me a true believer in the whole of government approach.

A special thank you to Jack Lew, Khushali Shah, the F bureau team and Kern-Anne Jones for helping to fund EGCI and
GSGI.




I thank all of you, my partners in EEB, and in the regional and functional bureaus for your friendship, kindness and
collaboration.




And most of all I am deeply grateful to Secretary Clinton for giving me the opportunity to advance this energy security
agenda, and for being such and amazing, inspiring, and courageous leader.




I can be reached after January 17 at:
