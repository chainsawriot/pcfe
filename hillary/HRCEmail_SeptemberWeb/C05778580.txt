Subject: Two Libyan fighter jets land in Malta (Reuters)

VALLETTA (Reuters) - Two Libyan fighter jets and two civilian helicopters landed unexpectedly in Malta on
Monday, witnesses said.

    Local newspaper reporters saw the single-seater Mirage jets land at Malta's international airport.

   Airport sources said two helicopters carrying seven people claiming to be French citizens also landed at the
airport. Maltese authorities were checking their identities, the sources said.

   The office of Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi said it was not clear whether the two fighter pilots intended to
ask for asylum. They initially had asked to refuel, it said.
