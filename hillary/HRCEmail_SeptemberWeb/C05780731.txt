Subject: AmCits Leaving Libya Tomorrow Morning

Jake,

Harold wanted me to update you in case you had not heard and so that the Secretary could know. Two American
Journalists, Clare Gillis and James Foley, are at the Hungarian Embassy in Tripoli tonight following their release. They will
be taken to the Tunisian border tomorrow by the Hungarians, who will leave Tripoli at 2:30AM Est. We estimate they
will reach and cross the border at approx 6:00AM EST. USG personnel are ready to meet them on the Tunisian side.

Please let me know if you have any more questions.

Aaron
