FOR RELEASE: Wednesday, March 16 at 3 pm

Interviews with 1,023 adult Americans conducted by telephone on March 11-13, 2011.

Nearly two-thirds of the American public has a favorable view of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton -- one of the highest
ratings she has ever had. Her all-time high was just after her husband was impeached in December, 1998, when her
favorable rating reached 67%, but before then, her favorable ratings hovered in the high 40's to mid 50's. As Senator,
her ratings dipped as low as 44% and never got higher than the mid-50s, and her favorability hovered around the 50%
mark throughout her presidential campaign. But after Barack Obama nominated her to be Secretary of State, her rating
rose to 66% and has stayed consistently above the 60% level since then. Two of her fellow Cabinet officers -- Treasury
Secretary Timothey Geithner and Defense Secretary Robert Gates -- are less well-known, which means that their
favorable ratings AND their unfavorable ratings are lower than Clinton's.
