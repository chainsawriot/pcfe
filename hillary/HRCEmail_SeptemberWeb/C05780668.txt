ANKARA — Hurriyet Daily News




The Turkish prime minister has expressed his desire to visit Hamas-controlled Gaza after a trip to Egypt, a move he will
reportedly make if Israel refuses to apologize to Turkey over last year's deadly flotilla raid.

"I wish to go to Gaza. If the necessary conditions emerge, I have a desire to go there," Prime Minister Recep Tayyip
Erdogan told a press conference Tuesday at Ankara's Esenboga airport before departing for northern Cyprus. He did not
elaborate further but said the Foreign Ministry was working to arrange the trip, a move that has drawn criticism from
Israel.

According to diplomatic sources, Erdogan was planning to cross into Gaza from the Rafah gate with Egypt during his trip
to the country July 21.

Taking into consideration that the U.N. panel on Gaza will release its report on the Mavi Marmara incident on July 27,
the prime minister decided to postpone the Gaza part of his trip due to the possibility of an apology from Israel. If this
does not happen before the U.N. report is released, Erdogan is reportedly considering going to Gaza during the Muslim
fasting month of Ramadan, which starts Aug.1, and breaking the Israeli embargo himself.

Feridun Sinirlioglu, undersecretary of the Turkish Foreign Ministry and Moshe Yalon, the vice prime minister of the
Israeli government, have been in secret talks in recent weeks to formulate how Israel would apology to Turkey and pay
compensation to the families of the nine Turkish citizens killed onboard the Gaza-bound aid ship. The U.N. inquiry panel
is expected to submit its report to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on July 27 and the report is set to be released Aug. 1.

The Daily News has learned that a draft text was introduced to both countries' prime ministers and a last meeting before
July 27 is expected to take place in New York. Turkey has made it clear that if there will be no agreement on an apology,
it stands ready to take further steps that would cause a deeper deterioration of bilateral ties.

In this sense, Erdogan's statement that he would visit Gaza and meet with Hamas leaders is seen as one of these steps.
Israel's defense establishment may support a "cautious" apology to Ankara for its deadly raid last year on the Mavi
Marmara, Israel's daily Haaretz reported Sunday.

Erdogan's possible visit was first reported in the Palestinian media over the weekend. The report caused fury on the
Israeli side. Turkey is working for intra-Palestinian reconciliation and the visit to Gaza, if it happens, will come after
Hamas leader Khaleed Mashal met with Turkish officials in Istanbul in June. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is set
to visit Turkey on July 21 to attend the conference of Palestinian ambassadors in Istanbul
