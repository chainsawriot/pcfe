Subject: RE: Bahrain

A breakaway part of the opposition did a sit-in outside the embassy and presented a petition. A political officer (not #2)
received the petition, as is customary, and urged the opposition to begin the dialogue. The petitioners then gave a false
story about what our person said. The Embassy immediately went out on twitter, Facebook, the Embassy website, and
via an Embassy press release and corrected the record. The petitioners later apologized on Bahraini TV.



                                                              Certainly in Bahrain, the Embassy blanked the media with
the correct story.

              just told my husband that the oppo in Bahrain posted on their website that they met w the #2 in our
embassy who told them that the US supported them and their demands which was very upsetting to everyone. What's
the story?
