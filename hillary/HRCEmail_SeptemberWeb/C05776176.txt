 Cheryl â€”Just a note to say that I have heard how hard you are working on Haiti. With everything you have to tend to, I
 just want to say what an inspiration it was to me to hear about your personal involvement.




   My first 7 months in Hungary has turned out to be exciting, interesting and challenging. I love it! Thanks again for your
' role in helping me get here. If you ever need anything, don't hesitate to call.




 All the best, Eleni
