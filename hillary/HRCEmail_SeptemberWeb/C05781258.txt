SYRIA REFORMS UNLIKELY TO APPEASE PROTESTERS

and functioning of political parties, media report. The Syria desk comments protesters will be skeptical of any
new law given the government's lack of credibility and its failure to meet demands for a new constitution. The
constitution currently guarantees the Baath party leadership in the country's politics. (Ops/Syria desk telcon,

toward real reforms. (Ops/Syria desk telcon, Xinhua News)
