RAMALLAH (Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Friday turned down Washington's request
to withdraw a U.N. Security Council resolution demanding Israel halt settlement expansion on occupied
Palestinian land.

   The decision was made unanimously during a meeting of the Palestine Liberation Organisation's executive
and the central committee of Abbas's Fatah movement, convened to discuss U.S. President Barack Obama's
appeal to Abbas on Thursday.

   "The Palestinian leadership has decided to go on to the U.N. Security Council to pressure Israel to halt
settlement activities. The decision was taken despite American pressure," said Wasel Abu Yousef, a PLO
executive member.
