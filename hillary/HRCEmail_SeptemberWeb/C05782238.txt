Subject: Pakistani police safely recover kidnapped American (AP)


LAHORE (AP) - Police say they have safely recovered a U.S. development expert who was kidnapped almost
two weeks ago from the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore.
   Lahore police chief Malik Ahmed Raza says authorities found 70-year-old Warren Weinstein during an early
morning operation August 25 in Khushab city.
   Raza says authorities tracked Weinstein after obtaining leads from three arrested suspects and also by
tracking mobile phone calls.
   Weinstein is the country director in Pakistan for J.E. Austin Associates, a U.S.-based firm that advises a
range of Pakistani business and government sectors.
   Khushab is also located in Punjab province, where Lahore is the capital.
