 Well, it was a challenge to balance all the interests so I'm pleased he responded positively. I'm also glad he is taking his
 work to other countries where he won't be so vulnerable to the fear of political involvement.

Secretary's Remarks: Remarks with Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Dipu Moni Before Their Meeting
Wed, 12 Oct 2011 15:54:27-0500


Remarks with Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Dipu Moni Before
Their Meeting

Remarks
Hillary Rodham Clinton
Secretary of State
Treaty Room
Washington, DC
October 12,2011




SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, I am very pleased to be welcoming the foreign minister of Bangladesh. Minister Moni has been here in
Washington meeting with officials and civil society and discussing the program and agenda that Bangladesh is following.

We have certainly watched with great interest as Bangladesh has tackled poverty. We appreciate the close cooperation on
counterterrorism, an issue that is very important to both of our countries. We want to work with Bangladesh and other countries in the
area to promote regional integration so that there are greater economic opportunities, that many of the problems that prevent the free
flow of commerce can be overcome so that the people of the entire region can prosper.

We know that governments alone cannot make change, that it has to come from the people. And we urge the Government of
Bangladesh to ensure that media outlets are able to exercise freedom of the press and that NGOs have the opportunity to be a vibrant
contributor to the future of Bangladesh. And of course, we have expressed directly to the government our concern and hope that the
Grameen Bank, which was well recognized by the world, particularly with a Nobel Peace Prize for what it's done to help alleviate
poverty, is able to continue to function productively on behalf of the Bangladeshi people.

So I'm looking forward to a robust and comprehensive meeting.

FOREIGN MINISTER MONI: Thank you. I'm very happy to be here. I have had a very fruitful day yesterday and today. I'm meeting with
Secretary Clinton and we have very effective cooperation and partnership with the U.S. on so many very important issues that are
important globally now. And we are working closely on all the issues that Secretary Clinton has just mentioned and also on climate
change and poverty alleviation and women's empowerment.

And Bangladesh, as a secular democratic country, having a very free and robust media, the very vibrant civil society, looks forward to
more effective cooperation with countries like the U.S., which is a good friend and partner. And I can assure Secretary Clinton and
everyone, friends all over the world, that Bangladesh Government will do and is doing everything in its capacity to uphold all the values
that we all cherish of freedom, of liberty, of cooperation, of rights for everyone.

And with regard to Grameen, as a statutory body enjoying all the rights and privileges that it does, Bangladesh Government is also
proud, as a country we are proud, that we have a Nobel-winning institution. And we believe firmly, firmly believe, that it will continue to
do the job that it is supposed to do with a lot of success. And we will see cooperation in every sector, including trade and investment,
from the U.S.

Thank you so much.
