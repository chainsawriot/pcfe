No worries, I had a great meeting with Jean-Louis.

The AP story is NOT accurate. I'll get you more details later. Making calls to PAP.


By the way, I'll be there starting next Monday, almost full time, I am sure I'll see you next week.

Damian:

Sorry I missed connecting with you today.

The following ticker just came across the department email.

Can you perhaps share some background b/f we inquire further as to the PM-designated and the President's objectives
regarding the IHRC and how the new administration is inclined to engage the international community.

I am going to reach out to Daniel but wanted first to connect with you.

Best.

Subject: New PM would end Haiti quake panel (AP)

 PORT-AU-PRINCE (AP) - The businessman nominated to be Haiti's next prime minister wants to scrap the
earthquake reconstruction commission co-chaired by former U.S. President Bill Clinton.
  Daniel-Gerard Rouzier says the 27-member commission is "dysfunctional" and has failed to accomplish
much reconstruction. Rouzier tells The Associated Press in an interview Wednesday that he would replace the
commission with a government agency.
  The commission was established after the January 2010 earthquake because international donors wanted
assurances that reconstruction would be orderly and free of the corruption that has long plagued Haiti. But it has
been criticized for its slow progress.
