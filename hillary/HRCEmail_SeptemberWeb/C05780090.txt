Per WHA:

Coverage in U.S., Canadian and BBC/Int'l but, outside of Mex in the region, not much. The coverage seems to be pretty
direct, linking it in most cases to Wikileaks. Have asked that they keep an eye out in case this changes/evolves.

Coverage of resignation across all major us outlets. pins resignation as casualty of wikileaks with many fewer references
to who he was dating.

They put out a whole statement from presidency but google translate is failing me. Here is what they tweeted:

Mexico-US relationship is strong, as befits two neighbors and friends, with common opportunities and challenges. The
Government of Mexico expresses its best wishes to Ambassador Pascual to complete your order in our country.
