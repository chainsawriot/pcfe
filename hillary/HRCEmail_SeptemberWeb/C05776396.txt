of his other projects from Jamie Patricof (Company Men, Blue Valentine) that also sound great. And pls wish him and
Georgina every good wish w the new baby and that we all hope to see them soon.

Dear Capricia,




As time moves on, I realize I haven't seen you and Mrs. Clinton (Hillary) in a long time, but I think of you both often. I
don't know if movie producers are still worthy in your world, but next time you're in NYC I'd love to see you.




I have such fond memories of you guys watching SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE. I made another movie you might like about the
ascendancy of King George after Edward abdicated, it's called KINGS SPEECH. The movie brings to light something that
many people don't know, which is that King George was a stutterer and he hired an actor to try and help him overcome
it. It's a fun movie that is much in the tradition of SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, again I think you would both like it (and
Hillary would approve because it's PG-13 with not too many swear words).

If you have any trips coming up I'd love to send it to you so you guys can watch and give me your opinion. I could also
include a copy of THE TILLMAN STORY, that one is obviously not a happy film, but it's an incredibly important one.




PS




Your bad friend,




Harvey
