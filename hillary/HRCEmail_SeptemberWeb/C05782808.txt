Loved seeing you the other night. And I miss you too. How about another women's dinner?

Also, I think your personal outreach will be crucial for Wendy. Can you get the Republican women to tell you they'll
support her? As soon as we get a vote out of Kerry's Comm, we'll push hard for a vote. But to get the time on the
calendar, we have to convince Harry Reid we will win. You and I can make this happen!! Onward to victory----H

awful as it was. There was. Leadership. and a sense of. National. Unity. Something. so wish we could get back to
