The Tripoli uprising has started. This is planned, but the TNC isn't sure how big it will be tonight. According to
           Qadhafi's forces didn't behave as predicted, in that they pulled back many units to Tripoli over the course of
the last couple of days -- meaning that there are more Qadhafi forces in Tripoli than anticipated when the TNC decided
to signal the uprising for 8/20.

ALGIERS (Reuters) - Crowds of opponents of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi were in the streets of the
capital Tripoli late on Saturday and gunfire could be heard from multiple locations, two residents told
Reuters.

   Mobile telephone subscribers received a text message from the government urging them to "go out in the
squares and streets to eliminate the armed agents," according to one resident who received the message on his
phone.
