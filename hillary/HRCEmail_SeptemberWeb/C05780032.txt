CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt's former President Mubarak and his two sons will appear before a Cairo court on
Tuesday, April 19, for questioning, state television said. Mubarak and his sons were detained earlier on
Wednesday. The public prosecutor had summoned the former leader over the killing of protesters, embezzling
of public funds and abuse of power.
