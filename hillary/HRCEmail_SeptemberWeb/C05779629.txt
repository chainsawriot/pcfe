Subject: Thousands chant for freedom at Syrian funeral (Reuters)

AMMAN, April 3 (Reuters) - Thousands of Syrians chanted freedom slogans on Sunday at a mass funeral for
eight protesters killed by security forces in the Damascus suburb of Douma, a witness said, in another sign of
defiance against Baathist rule.

   "Freedom, freedom, freedom. One, one, one. The Syrian people are one," the crowd chanted as they carried
the eight bodies draped in Syrian flags, according to the witness at the funeral.

  "The traitor is the one who kills his own people," they shouted as the funeral proceeded in the streets of the
huge suburb, bringing the challenge to President Bashar al-Assad's 11-year-rule to the outskirts of his capital
