Thanks on both counts, Hillary. I so admire your willingness and ability to focus on Latam in the midst of all you're coping
with. Your peroration on the trust deficit was powerful. I hope there's a speech there at some point. Cheers, S

I really liked it and have nothing to say other than: you're a terrific writer and Richard is an unforgettable subject. You
bring him to life on the page. Thank you.

Also, thx too for the other night. I found it quite useful and hope your Brookings team will share their conclusions and
policy recommendations.

All best, H
