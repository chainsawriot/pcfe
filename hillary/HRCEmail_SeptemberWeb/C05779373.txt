Hi ambassador,
Sorry to trouble you, but President Calderon just met with our editorial board and suggested he had lost confidence in
you because of Wikileaks. I am writing a story now on this. I wanted to see if you had any comment.
Also, I normally don't delve into ambassador's private lives, but it seems there is a personal element here involving your
girlfriend. I don't want to pry, just want to see if you wanted to say anything on that.
I'm at my office, 202-334-7260.

 Mary Beth -- I really apologize, but I'm out of time on this trip. Perhaps we can talk by phone at some point. All the best,
 Carlos

Dear Ambassador Pascual,
It was great to see you in Guanajuato on Monday. (Although I am still recovering from that trip!).
I was wondering if it might be possible to have coffee or lunch or something when you are in town next week, to talk a
little more about Mexico. It would be off the record. I am just trying to work on some Mexico stories and would really
value your thoughts.
I am in town every day except Friday (the 4th). I know you will be extremely busy, and I can certainly be flexible.
Many thanks and best
Mary Beth
