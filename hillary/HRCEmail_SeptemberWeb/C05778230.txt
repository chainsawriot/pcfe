Subject: Palestinian president comments on leaked documents (AP)

JERUSALEM (AP) - Palestinians were prepared to compromise over two of the toughest issues, Jerusalem and
refugees, during peace talks in 2008, the Al-Jazeera TV channel reported January 23, quoting from documents it
said came from the talks. Palestinian negotiators quickly denied the reports, saying parts of the documents were
fabricated.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he has kept Arab countries fully briefed on the negotiations with
Israel. The chief Palestinian negotiator in the 2008 talks, Ahmed Qureia, told The Associated Press that "many
parts of the documents were fabricated, as part of the incitement against the Palestinian Authority and the
Palestinian leadership." He denied making an offer about the Jewish enclaves in east Jerusalem, claiming that
Israel refused to discuss the issue. The current chief negotiator, Saeb Erekat, dismissed the TV report as "lies
and half truths."

Abbas told Egyptian newspaper editors in Cairo on January 23 that he kept the Arab League updated on all
details of the negotiations with Israel, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa. "I don't know from where
Al-Jazeera came with secret things," Abbas was quoted as saying. "There is nothing we hide from our brothers,
the Arabs." Erekat said the Jerusalem document was an Israeli proposal, not Palestinian, and he denied the
report about a Palestinian offer to limit the return of refugees.
