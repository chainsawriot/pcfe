Subject: Gaddafi son sees negotiation, ceasefire in Libya (Reuters)

TRIPOLI (Reuters) - A son of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi said on Friday that his forces were holding
back in fighting with rebels in western Libya and hoped that a negotiated ceasefire could be in place by
Saturday.
   Speaking in English to foreign journalists flown to Tripoli under official escort, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi said of
fighting in two western cities: "In Misrata, in Zawiya, we have a problem.
   "We are dealing with terrorists ... The army decided not to attack the terrorists, and to give a chance to
negotiation. Hopefully we will do it peacefully and will do so by tomorrow."
