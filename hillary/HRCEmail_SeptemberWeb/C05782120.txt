Background: INC Chairman Abdel Jalil is the widely respected and mild-mannered leader of the Transitional National
Council, considered the "anti-Qadhafi." He announced the arrest of Qadhafi's son, Saif al-lslami, by rebel forces August
21 and is reportedly preparing now for an address to the Libyan people on the end of Qadhafi's reign. While the INC
has said they are committed to avoiding bloodshed and retributive violence, it is important now that Abdel Jalil make a
national appeal to Libyans to do so. You sent him a letter encouraging the consolidation of control over the militias and
a credible investigation of General Younis' killing, which was hand-delivered by A/S Feltman August 20.
