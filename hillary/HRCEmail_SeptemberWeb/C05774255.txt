I Just met this morning with Sen Lugar and he said you were terrific in your hearing and he was very pleased at what you
had said on Law of the Seas. He also was pleased to hear that we were working on conflict minerals re: DRC and thought
his bill on transperency provided a good approach. I told hm that on your trip there, you elevated this issue and have
been working on it since.

I know you're meeting with the S Koreans today. They have the G20 presidency next year and many of the
parliamentaians and other officials want to put economic growth and investing in women-run SME's high on the agenda.
