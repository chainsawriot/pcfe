Subject: Libya's Qadhafi says Tunisia ouster was too hasty (Reuters)

RABAT (Reuters) - Col. Muammar Qadhafi said neighboring Tunisia is suffering bloodshed and lawlessness because its people were in
too much of a rush to get rid of their president. Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, Tunisian leader for 23 years, was forced to step down after
weeks of protests. His overthrow has reverberated around other countries in the Arab world with long-serving leaders. "I am very
pained by what is happening in Tunisia," Qadhafi said in a speech reported by Libya's official Jana news agency. "Tunisia now lives in
fear ... Families could be raided and slaughtered in their bedrooms and the citizens in the street killed as if it was the Bolshevik or the
American revolution," said Qadhafi, Libya's leader since 1969. "What is this for? To change Zine al-Abidine? Hasn't he told you he
would step down after three years? Be patient for three years and your son stays alive," Qadhafi said. Qadhafi said the turmoil
would only be justified if Tunisia adopts his model of rule - known as the Third Universal Theory - which replaces representative
democracy with direct rule by the people through institutions called popular committees. He said this model "marks the final
destination for the peoples' quest for democracy. If this is what the events (in Tunisia) are for, then it has to be made clear."
