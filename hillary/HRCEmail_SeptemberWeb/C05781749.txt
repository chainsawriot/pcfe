Dear Cheryl and Alice:

I would be most grateful if you would pass the following message to Secretary Clinton from me:

Dear Madam Secretary:

Thank you very much both for the very kind, generous and thoughtful message which you released to the press
yesterday and for the thoughts of Alice which you conveyed in it. She admired you and your leadershio very much and
recalled with much joy the times she had met and worked with you.

                       Thank you so much for having done so.

I also understand you had asked to speak with me and I would very much like to do so and can call whenever it might be
convenient.

With my deepest thanks,

Respectfully, Tom Pickering
