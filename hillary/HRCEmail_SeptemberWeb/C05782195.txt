One thing I failed to mention (in the spirit of looking for good news for the weekend) is that Serbs and
Kosovars have apparently agreed on a customs stamp and restoring bilateral trade. That would be
a big breakthrough and a sign that Serbia is willing to do the right thing in the name of keeping EU
prospects on track.

Have a good weekend. Let's stay in Paris longer next time.

This email is UNCLASSIFIED.
