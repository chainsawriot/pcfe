   SANAA, Yemen - (AP) Medical and security officials say renewed violence in Yemen's capital has killed
at least nine people as street battles broke out between forces loyal to the regime and its opponents.
   The officials say six of those killed in Thursday's violence died in central Sanaa when government forces
shelled thousands gathered there with mortars and rocket propelled grenades. Snipers on rooftops also targeted
the protesters.
   Three bystanders were killed when a mortar shell in Sanaa's northern Hasbah district.
   The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.
