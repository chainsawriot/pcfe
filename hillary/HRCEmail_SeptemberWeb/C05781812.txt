Fred Bergsten gave a speech on international economics in which he gives you a hat tip:

However one answers these questions, it is clear that international economic issues will have to play a much larger role in

both the economy policy and overall foreign policy of the United States. The current Administration recognizes both

realities. In a series of summits of the G-20, the new steering committee for the world economy, half of whose

membership is emerging markets, President Obama has stressed the imperative of a rebalancing of the world economy

including a rebalancing of the United States but emphasizing correctly that others — notably the huge surplus countries of

China, Germany and Japan — must rebalance in the opposite directions if the process is to succeed. Secretary of State

Hillary Clinton has begun a series of speeches stressing the growing centrality of economic issues in US foreign

policy and calling on other countries to cooperate much more fully in that context.
