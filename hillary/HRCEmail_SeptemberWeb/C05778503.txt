Subject:                          One more thing



I forgot to mention my work with the American Federation of Teachers. In addition to the child labor partnership that
began last year, we are looking to partner more directly on teacher-to-teacher outreach. We are starting with the
Caribbean region, which I believe will resonate with U.S. teachers in the Diaspora from that region â€” many as you know,
live in New York.

I am so proud to be working with you and the amazing team here at State. I continually want to thank you for this
opportunity! As always, please don't hesitate to let me know if there is anything I can do for you.

Huge hugs to you and please send my warm regards to Chelsea.
Laura
