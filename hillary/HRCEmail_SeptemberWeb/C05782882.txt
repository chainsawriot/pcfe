Subject: Egypt's security chief testifies in Mubarak trial (AP)

  CAIRO - (AP) Egypt's top security chief is testifying in a closed session of the trial of ousted President Hosni
Mubarak, charged with complicity in the killing of protesters in the uprising against his rule.
  Interior Minister Gen. Mansour el-Issawi is the latest in a string of top figures summoned to the stand under a
complete media blackout, barring journalists from attending or even reporting accounts of what was said in the
sessions.
  The witnesses are expected to address whether Mubarak ordered police forces to use lethal force against
protesters or did nothing to prevent bloodshed. Around 850 protesters were killed during the 18-day uprising.
   El-Issawi, who testified Wednesday, was named interior minister after Mubarak's Feb. 11 fall.
