Club, Arlington, VA, immediately after. Directions to Fort Myer are provided below, as well as directions to the Army

If entering through the Hatfield Gate off Washington Blvd, once you are on post, proceed straight ahead to the three

Park in one of the parking lots near the chapel.

Following the service, if you are continuing to the interment, proceed to your car and form a line behind the caisson in
front of the chapel. Follow the caisson into the cemetery and park on the road near the gravesite, which is in Section 36.

After the interment service, exit via the Arlington Cemetery Main Gate which is close to the gravesite. Turn onto
