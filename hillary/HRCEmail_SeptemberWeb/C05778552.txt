Very nice job on the conference. Heard many positive comments over last couple days about Secretary's initiative in
holding this, and what Mike Polt said at end of today's session was a widely-shared view.

Others tested HRC's capacity for mutual understanding and mutual respect, but this worked out well.

Many thanks.
