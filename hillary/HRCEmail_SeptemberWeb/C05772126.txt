Bill talked to Kislyak.
Said it's our understanding that the exercise won't begin before Sunday evening NY time.

Kislyak said that was helpful and he would convey. Bill said                     Kislyak will get the word back.

Russians have called an emergency session of Council today on Korea prompted by concern about exercise. We are
obliged as President of Council to grant this request. Timing tbd. Likely 2 or 3pm. Open session. They aim to ask 6G to
send an envoy (likely USG Lynn Pascoe) to 6PT countries and DPRK to try to ease tensions.
