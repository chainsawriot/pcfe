Not to be outdone by its neighbor to the west... Turns out only a reshuffle of cabinet, not a dissolution.

Funny story: friend of mine in Pakistan said best tweet going around follows - to save energy, the government has
turned out the light at the end of the tunnel.

It makes sense since Zardari wants to avoid having to deal with a vote in parliament on a new government. But this will
not address Nawaz's demand.

It seems to be a reshuffle rather than dissolution. A bit more detail courtesy of PolCouns Jonathan Pratt (copied):

Hafez Shaikh is being quoted on Express 24 as saying that a reshuffle was agreed to expand the coalition. They are going
to bring in MOM and JUI-F, per Shaikh. So it's part of a deal to bring their partners back in and presumably others, if they
intend to expand the coalition.

There is nothing about dissolving the cabinet and a PPP contact just told me he doubts it. Reshuffle seems to be in the
cards, but as part of the ongoing negotiations.

Some ministers will be same. This was a key demand of Nawaz, smaller cabinet and more competent. It could be good
news for the country. No word yet on timing of reshuffle.

What's your assessment of that? Positive news, or too soon to tell, depending on whom will be appointed to key
ministries like Foreign and Finance?

News from Pakistan has it that Zardari and Gilani have agreed to reshuffle gov and dissolve cabinet.
