Subject:                           Thank you!


Thx for coming last night despite the treadmill you continue to be on every day. It meant so much to the Chinese who
said over and over, "Please thank Mrs. Clinton for caring about us." The initiative is off to a strong start, thanks to you.
Also, I met with Mikulski and Hutchison yesterday on initial steps for them to take to help women in Egypt and Tunisia.
They are going to work on a Senate letter to Egypt's leaders to stress the importance of women's participation, an op-
ed in an international publication on why women matter if the Arab spring is to be sustained, and they want to get some
loose targeting language for women on assistance programs, especially small grants. They both wanted you to know
that stand ready to help you in any way that's useful.
Stay warm in Greenland!
