Subject: Libyan rebels offer amnesty for turning in Gaddafi (Reuters)


BENGHAZI (Reuters) - Libya's rebel council said on Wednesday it was offering an amnesty to any of
Muammar Gaddafi's entourage who kill or capture him.

   Council chairman Mustafa Abdel Jalil also said a Benghazi businessman, whom he did not identify, had
offered a reward of two million Libyan dinars ($1.3 million) for Gaddafi's capture.

   "The National Transitional Council announces that any of his inner cicle who kill Gaddafi or capture him,
society will give amnesty or pardon for any crime he has committed," he told a news conference.
