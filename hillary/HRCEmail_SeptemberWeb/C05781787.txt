Subject: McCain says U.S. should recognize Libyan rebels (Reuters)


BENGHAZI (Reuters) - U.S. Senator John McCain Friday called on the United States to recognize Libyan
rebels' transitional council as the true voice of the Libyan people and transfer frozen assets to them.
  McCain, speaking to reporters while visiting the rebel stronghold of Benghazi in eastern Libya, also called
for NATO to step up its air campaign and said Western allies should provide rebels with training, weapons and
command-and-control activities to help overthrow leader Muammar Gaddafi.
