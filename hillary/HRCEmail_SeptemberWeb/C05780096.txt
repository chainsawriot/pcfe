Subject: Mullen says stalemate a possibility in Libya (Reuters)

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. military commander Sunday said the end-game of military action in
Libya was "very uncertain" and acknowledged it could end in a stalemate with Libyan leader Muammar
Gaddafi.

    Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, told CBS' "Face the Nation" program that
the military mission has a clear, limited scope. But he could not predict how long the action might take or what
its outcome might be.

    Asked if it could end in a stalemate with Gaddafi, Mullen replied: "That's a possibility."
