Subject: Jordanian protesters demand closing of US Embassy (AP)


   AMMAN, Jordan - (AP) Demonstrators have demanded the closing of the U.S. Embassy in Jordan over
Wikileaks cables suggesting covert U.S. plans to turn Jordan into a home for Palestinians.
   It was a rare anti-American demonstration in Jordan, a close ally of the U.S.
   The 70 activists burned American and Israeli flags in a noisy protest opposite the embassy in Amman on
Wednesday.
   They chanted, "The people want the Americans out."
   Roughly half of the country's 6 million population is of Palestinian origin. With Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks stalled, some Jordanians fear Israel may try to deport Palestinians to Jordan.
   This week Jordan's King Abdullah II spoke out strongly against using Jordan as a substitute for a Palestinian
state, a concept favored by a tiny extremist minority among Israelis.
