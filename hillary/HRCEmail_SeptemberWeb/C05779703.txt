Cheryl:
Over the last two hours, I and my deputies have consulted on several occasions with our embassy in Abidjan and our
ambassador there has been in close contact with the French ambassador and the head of the French military unit in
Abidjan.
 The information coming out of Paris is confusing — confusing to us and confusing to the French diplomats and military
leadership in Abidjan. At this time, they report there is•no evacuation of French citizens planned or underway. Paris has
called for a "regroupement" of French citizens, but even the French on the ground do not know what Paris has in mind
except perhaps French citizens gathering in clusters for greater security and possible future evacuation. But the French
ambassador in Abidjan believes that the French citizens who are there should continue to shelter in place and not move
about the city or travel to other locations. The situation is to unstable for French citizens to move without military
escorts. The French ambassador is also not calling for an evacuation.
I remain confident in our current security and operating posture. We are secure in our building, and none of our
personnel are moving around the city. The French continue to reassure us on the ground that they will assist us if we
need help and evacuate us if that is required. Our ambassador has reviewed his contingency plans and may ask for some
additional security officers, but he has confirmed to me that he thinks his security posture is good.
The French hope to have some clarification of the instructions from Paris tomorrow. And I intend to call my two
counterparts in Paris very early tomorrow morning to determine precisely what the French are planning with respect to
their citizens.
One last note, UNOCI with French military support are slated to attack Gbagbo's tanks, armored personnel carriers and
heavy guns which have been menacing Ouattara's forces and protecting Gbagbo's last remaining strongholds. If this
operation is successful, it could be another tipping point in favor of Ouattara.

PARIS, April 3 (Reuters) - France is mulling a possible evacuation of its 12,000 citizens from Ivory Coast,
French defence minister Gerard Longuet said on Sunday, as fighting between rival groups intensified in the
African cocoa producer.

   "This is a question which is being asked and which will be settled in the next few hours," Longuet said in an
interview on French television LCI.

   Battles continued at the weekend between forces loyal to incumbent Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo
and those of his rival, president claimant Alassane Outtara.

    Ggabgo is refusing to cede power after losing a U.N. certified election to Outtara.

   "We will not expose French people to being hostages or indirect victims of confrontation between these two
forces," Longuet said.
