S Specials, Huma -- I'd be grateful if you could pass this to 5, for her information. Thank you.

Madam Secretary: I want to let you know about a temporary rotation in Benghazi. TNC Envoy Chris Stevens has been
On the road since March 13, when he began his outreach mission, and has been in Benghazi since April 5.

                              I discussed this with Bill Burns today. Bill and I support this request and look forward to
the opportunity to discuss with Chris the way forward with the INC.

I know how important it is to have continual coverage (security conditions permitting) in Benghazi. I will send Embassy
Tripoli's DCM Joan Polaschik to serve as Acting Envoy during Chris' absence. Like Chris, she knows many of the INC
leaders from her time in Tripoli. Since her return to Washington, she's been working with Gene and NEA on Libya
policy and also been coordinating many of the support issues for the team in Benghazi.




Cheers,
Jeff
