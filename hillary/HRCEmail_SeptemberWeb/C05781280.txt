Walter:


Sorry I was not able to be at the meeting last week.


I just read the WSJ piece and I have to say that I find the continued attacks upon DoS with respect to Internet
circumvention very troubling. We have said on may occasions that we strongly support BBG's efforts to obtain
additional funding for circumvention tools. However, I worry that the seemingly endless attempts to undermine what
DoS is doing in this critical area will impede the efforts you and I are making to bring our two organizations closer
together. I was particularly troubled by the following quote from the WSJ piece:

          "Some of the dysfunction in State Department priorities is structural. VOA and the other broadcasting services
          were independently run by the U.S. Information Agency from the 1950s until the early 1990s, when for the brief
          "end of history" moment after the Cold War it seemed these efforts were no longer as important. USIA was
          disbanded, but the diplomats of the State Department have little interest in upsettinaother countries by
          defendina broadcasting or circumvention efforts."

As you know, the Secretary has been very forceful in her defense of internet freedom and international broadcasting.
She has spoken publically on this issue a number of times and all of us have raised it, and will continue to raise it, in our
meetings with government representatives at the highest level. I would greatly appreciate your assistance in working
with me on this and in ensuring that our fellow governors and respective staffs are on board as well.

Thanks.

Judith
