Subject: Son of NY bomb plot sheik killed in Afghanistan (AP)


CAIRO (AP) - Egypt's radical Islamic Group says a U.S. drone strike has killed a son of Egyptian-born Sheik
Omar Abdel Rahman in Afghanistan.
   The Gamaa Islamiya, or Islamic Group, had posted on its website on Saturday a notice mourning the death of
Ahmed Abdel Rahman, the son of the "Blind Sheik" now serving a life sentence in the U.S. for his involvement
in a plot to blow up New York city landmarks.
   Abdel Rahman was the spiritual leader of the Gamaa, as well as of the men convicted in the 1993 World
Trade Center bombing.
   The group did not say when the strike took place. The last few days have seen an uptick in U.S. drone
attacks, mostly in Pakistan, but close to the Afghan border.
