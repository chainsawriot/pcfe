Subject: Norway police lower youth camp death toll to 68 (AP)

OSLO (AP) - Police have lowered the death toll in the youth camp massacre outside the Norwegian capital to
68, down from 86.
  Police spokesman Oystein Maeland said that higher, erroneous figure emerged as police and rescuers were
focusing on helping survivors and securing the area.
  Maeland also said the death toll in the bomb blast in Oslo before the shootings had gone up to eight, from
seven. That puts the total number of people confirmed killed in the twin attacks at 76, down from 93.
