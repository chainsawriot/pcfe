Subject: CODEL McCain wheels down

Just landed in Crete, safe and sound, and I want to thank all of you for making this amazing day possible. The Senator is
thrilled. It was extremely informative and valuable for him, and -- I'm confident to say -- for Chris and his terrific team on
the ground. Despite all of the complexity, uncertainty, and moving parts that came along with this CODEL -- and despite
the fact that most of what you did to make it happen had never been done before! -- the day went flawlessly. Just
flawlessly. I know how much time and extra effort that all of you dedicated to make our trip successful, and we cannot
thank you enough. If we can ever be of help to you, please let us know.

Best,

Chris Brose
