Take that, Tim Gunn.

Hillary Clinton made quite the feminine style statement in D.C. on Thursday, stopping by the Norwegian
Embassy.

The Secretary of State accented her soft pink blazer and flat pearl necklace with a spiffy white pocket square,
finishing off the look with the longer hairstyle she's favored as of late.

The ladylike ensemble should be enough to silence Tim Gunn, who recently criticized the politico for her
"gender confused" fashion sense.

Take a look below.
