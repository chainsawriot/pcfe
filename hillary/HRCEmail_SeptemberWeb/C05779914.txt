Subject: Security Council meets to consider Libya sanctions (AP)

UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The U.N. Security Council has begun urgent deliberations to consider imposing
sanctions to punish Libya for violent attacks against anti-government protesters. The sanctions under
consideration at Saturday's session include an arms embargo against the Libyan government and a travel ban
and asset freeze against Gadhafi, his relatives and key regime members. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon
is urging council members to take concrete action to protect civilians in Libya where some estimates indicate
more than 1,000 people have been killed in less than two weeks. The council is also considering whether to
refer the violent crackdown in Libya to the International Criminal Court to investigate charging the Gadhafi
regime with crimes against humanity.
