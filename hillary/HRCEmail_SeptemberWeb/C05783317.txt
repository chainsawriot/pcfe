Subject: Saleh calls for early election, says committed to power transfer (Reuters)

CAIRO, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh called on Sunday for early elections, saying
he was still committed to handing over power to end months of protests against his rule.

   "Let's all go towards dialogue, understanding and peaceful exchange of power through elections and early
presidential elections," Saleh said in his first televised speech since he returned to Yemen after more than three
months in Saudi Arabia.
