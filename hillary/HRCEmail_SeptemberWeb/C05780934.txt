Subject: Tunisia court gives Ben All 15-year jail term (Reuters)

TUNIS (Reuters) - A Tunisian court sentenced former president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in absentia to 15 years
in prison on Monday after finding him guilty of illegal possession of drugs and weapons.

    The verdict and sentence were read out by the judge in the courtroom after a one-day trial.

  Lawyers for Ben Ali, who was ousted in January and is now in Saudi Arabia, boycotted the trial, saying it
was a sham. Last month he was sentenced to 35 years in jail for other charges.
