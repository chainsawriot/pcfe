Subject: WaPo + Wiki - Syria next

Guys - WaPo plans to report for Friday on Wikicables that cover our support for democracy/human rights in Syria. NEA
(Tamara) and DRL (Posner) are extremely concerned that WaPo's identifying any groups we have supported will
endanger lives in Syria and we have made our case to WaPo. WaPo is considering only reporting the names of those
organizations outside Syria that are public and already known to the Syrian government and may report only that we
support pro-democracy activities generically and not get into the specifics which concern us most. Still, NEA worries
that WaPo will overcrank that we have been working for regime change and we anticipate it will be a bad story as it will
allow the Syrians to blame outside forces (us) for their internal problems and use it to try to justify an even tougher
crackdown.
