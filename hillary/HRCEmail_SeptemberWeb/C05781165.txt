Statement by President and Secretary Clinton on the Passing of General John Shalikashvili

Hillary and I are deeply saddened by the passing of our close friend and colleague, General John Shalikashvili. He
represented America at its best. An immigrant who entered the Army as a draftee, he rose to become an exceptional
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs-of-Staff, who oversaw more than forty operations, including the liberation of Haiti from a
brutal dictatorship, and NATO's first use of force outside its member countries in Bosnia. His staunch advocacy for the
Bosnian people saved thousands of lives in the Balkans. He was also a key advocate for nuclear weapons reduction, the
expansion of NATO and the creation of a partnership for peace, and always, for the men and women in uniform from
whose ranks he came. I was honored to award him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.General Shalikashvili will be
remembered as a superb general and a wonderful man, who saw the world through some of the most critical moments
of the late 20th Century. Our thoughts and prayers are with Joan and Brant.
