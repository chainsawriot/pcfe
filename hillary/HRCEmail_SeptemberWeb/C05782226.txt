DUBAI (Reuters) - The second in command of Libya's intelligence services declared his allegiance to rebel
forces fighting Muammar Gaddafi on Wednesday in an interview aired on Arabiya television.

   "I put myself in the service of the nation and call on generals and soldiers who are the sons of Libya to join
the 17th February revolution," Gen. Khalifah Mohammed Ali said in an interview with Arabiya.

    In a rolling banner headline, Arabiya said the general had left his post.
