Subject: President-elect's stern warning

President-elect Michel MuteIly sent a stern warning, one of his strongest since his election against the CEP and INITE
(without actually naming them) advising its members to clean up their act or face the rigors of the law. Speaking in a
strong voice and stressing his point, the President elect said that his mission was to get Haiti's people out of misery by
bringing in investments and that he did not intend to stir away from his goal. He warned all those whose intentions were
to put hurdles in his way that he meant to strike them with all the means the law put at his disposal.
