RAMALLAH (AP) - A senior Palestinian Authority official has accused the Gulf state of Qatar of using its Al-
Jazeera TV channel to undermine the West Bank's Palestinian leadership with a news report about Mideast
peace talks. Al-Jazeera aired late January 23 what it said were leaked documents showing the Palestinians
agreed to deep concessions on two of the thorniest issues in negotiations with Israel: Jerusalem and the fate of
Palestinian refugees. Yasser Abed Rabbo, secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said the
news network engaged in "media games ... to trick and mislead the simple citizen." Abed Rabbo says the report
relied on out-of-context quotes and fabrications. But he remained vague in disputing some of the show's specific
claims.
