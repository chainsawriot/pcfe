Subject: Oman replaces 3 high-level posts as protests widen (AP)


MUSCAT (AP) - Oman's ruler replaced three top government positions Saturday in an attempt to quell more
than a week of widening demonstrations calling for jobs and political reforms that in the latest burst spread to a
key oil region.
   Sultan Qaboos bin Said ordered the second top-level shake-up in a week Saturday in the tightly controlled
Arabian peninsula nation. He dumped the head of the Palace Office, which oversees security affairs, and
replaced the minister who holds the most senior adviser post. He also replaced another minister who deals with
internal matters within the ruling structure.
