Subject: Tunisia gas pipe hit by blast but still working (Reuters)


TUNIS (Reuters) - A pipeline that delivers gas from Algeria to Italy via Tunisia was hit by an explosion in
northern Tunisia on Monday but is still functioning, the Tunisian Interior Ministry said on Tuesday.

   The bombing of the pipeline was most likely an act of sabotage, a ministry spokesman said, without
indicating who might be responsible.

   The pipeline, which was attacked near the town of Zaghouan, south of Tunis, was still functioning normally,
the spokesman said.

  Algeria has provided natural gas to Italy since 1983 through the 775 km pipeline, which runs through
Tunisia.
