Subject: Israeli air strike wounds three Palestinians in Gaza (Reuters)



GAZA (Reuters) - An Israeli air strike wounded three Palestinians in the northern Gaza Strip on Saturday, the
Israeli military and Palestinian medical officials said.

   An Israeli military spokeswoman said the air strike targeted a militant squad that was preparing to launch
rockets across the border into Israel.

   Palestinian medical officials in Gaza said the strike in the town of Beit Hanoun wounded three men, one of
them critically. The men were taken to hospital for treatment and no militant group claimed them as
members.

   The Israel-Gaza border has been mostly quiet since the Jewish state and the Islamist group Hamas, which
controls the Gaza Strip, agreed to a ceasefire after five days of cross-border violence in August when 15
Palestinians, including five civilians, and one Israeli were killed.
