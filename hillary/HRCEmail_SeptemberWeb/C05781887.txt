Subject: Afghan president: 31 Americans killed in crash (AP)

KABUL, Afghanistan - (AP) Afghan President Hamid Karzai says 31 U.S. special forces and seven Afghan
soldiers were killed in a helicopter crash in eastern Wardak province.
   It's the highest number of casualties recorded in a single incident in Afghanistan.
   Karzai said in a statement on Saturday that he has sent condolences to President Barack Obama for the
victims of the overnight crash.
   The Taliban have claimed responsibility, saying their fighters downed the helicopter in a battle with NATO
troops.
