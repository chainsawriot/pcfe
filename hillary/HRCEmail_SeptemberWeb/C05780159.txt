 "A one-time flood tax will have to be imposed on the well-off and people of means to help shore up relief and
rehabilitation efforts," he said at a meeting of women ministers, parliamentarians and representatives of non-
governmental organisations.

"Unless we are prepared to share bread with our grief- and disaster-stricken brethren, we should not expect others to
help us.

"I have already advised the government to tap into indigenous resources wherever there is room," he said.

The president said that funds would be disbursed transparently and every citizen would have access to information
relating to the aid received and distributed.
