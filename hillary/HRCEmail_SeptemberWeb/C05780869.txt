We had Cretz talk to Giacomo for this one and it turned out well, granted NYT was probably predisposed to support our
effort but Gene gave her more ammo. We're doing more of this engagement with the editorial writers. Go team!

The Libya Campaign
Four months into the NATO air campaign, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi is still in power, protected by loyalists
and mercenaries. Americans are weary of war, and patience in Europe is also wearing thin. But NATO must not
give up.

If Colonel Qaddafi is allowed to have his way, thousands more Libyans will die. The credibility of NATO and
this country would also be severely damaged. Colonel Qaddafi, who has a long history of sponsoring
international terrorism, is not one to let bygones be bygones.

There is progress. The make-shift rebel army — aided by British, French and Italian advisers and armed by
France and Qatar — is slowly improving. NATO strikes on military command centers, including Colonel
Qaddafi's compound in Tripoli, have done real damage. This week's International Criminal Court indictment of
Colonel Qaddafi, one of his sons and his intelligence chief on charges of crimes against humanity should be a
warning to all of his cronies.

A naval blockade and international sanctions are increasingly having an effect. Oil revenues, the government's
main income, are down by two-thirds. There are reports of long gasoline lines in Tripoli and rising bread prices.
On Thursday, people fleeing Tripoli told of overnight gunfire and signs of revolt.

The Qaddafi clan is watching closely for signs that NATO's will is flagging. Italy's recent call for a cease-fire
(which could give government forces time to regroup) and second-guessing by the Arab League's outgoing
leader, Amr Moussa, are not helpful. Neither are Congressional efforts to force an end to American support for
the air campaign.

President Obama was wrong to ignore the War Powers Act, but that should not stop the House and Senate from
adopting the Kerry-McCain resolution authorizing the mission to continue for another year.

NATO must help, but the Libyan people are the only ones who can bring the regime down.

The rebels need more military advisers and weapons and access to $30 billion in frozen Qaddafi government
funds. The United States and other countries need to remove the legal obstacles to getting that money.

The alliance should extend sanctions to more of Colonel Qaddafi's cronies and the subsidiaries of state-owned
enterprises. Washington and its partners should also help the rebels start building the political and civil
institutions they will need to keep.a post-Qaddafi Libya from descending into chaos.

There has been recent talk by all sides about a possible political deal between the rebels and the government.
We are eager to see an end to the fighting. But Washington and NATO must stand firmly with the rebels and
reject any solution that does not involve the swift ouster of Colonel Qaddafi and real freedom for Libyans.
