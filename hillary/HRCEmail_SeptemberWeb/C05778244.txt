Subject: Iran hangs two convicted opposition members (AP)




TEHRAN (AP) â€” Iran hanged two members of the opposition People's Mujahedeen convicted over the 2009 post-election
turmoil. The official IRNA news agency said Jafar Kazemi and Mohammad Ali Hajaghaei were executed after an appeals
court upheld their death sentences. It said they filmed and distributed footage of massive anti-government protests
that swept Iran after the disputed presidential election in June 2009. The opposition contends Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
won through ballot fraud.
