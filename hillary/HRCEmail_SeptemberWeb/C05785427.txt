Subject: Saudi activist: Woman driver freed from detention (AP)

DUBAI (AP) - A rights activist in Saudi Arabia says authorities have released a woman detained for defying the
ultraconservative kingdom's ban on female drivers.
   Waleed Aboul Khair says the 32-year-old woman, Manal al-Sherif, was freed May 30 on an order from Saudi
officials. Al-Sherif had been detained since May 21 after posting an Internet video of her driving as part of a
campaign for a mass protest next month against the restriction.
   Al-Sherif had been ordered to remain in custody until at least early June.
   The reason for the early release was not announced by authorities, but it followed growing pressure from
rights groups and others in Saudi Arabia and the West.
