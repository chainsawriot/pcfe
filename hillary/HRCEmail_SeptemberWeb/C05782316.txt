Subject: Muslim sect claims bombing on Nigerian UN building (AP)



ABUJA (AP) - A spokesman for a radical Muslim sect in Nigeria known locally as Boko Hararn has claimed
responsibility for the car bombing at the United Nations' office that killed at least 16 people.
   The spokesman on Friday talked with the BBC's Hausa language service, which is widely trusted and listened
to throughout Nigeria's Muslim north. They often make claims via that BBC service.
   Boko Haram, which means "Western education is sacrilege," has carried out a series of bombings and
assassinations in northern Nigeria in the last year. They claimed a car bombing that struck Nigeria's federal
police headquarters in June that killed at least two people.
