Dear Team

I am forwarding the message below and my deep thanks for all you did on b/h of these              which I know is all in
a days work for you but is the difference b/w life and death for them.

Thank you so much. It is humbling to see the unsung efforts and lengths to which you and other colleagues go in your
work.

Best
Cdm
