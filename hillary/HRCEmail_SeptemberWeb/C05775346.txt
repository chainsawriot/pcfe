Cheryl




The Secretary's speech in Krakow was a home run. I am getting lots of comments like this one from people in my world.
This speech will give us lots of running room to follow up on these issues.




When your schedule permits I would like to come see you. It has been a long time since we've talked and it would be
good to catch up on a few things.




Best




Mike

Subject: Thank you




Dear Assistant Secretary Posner:




I am writing to express my deep appreciation to you, Dara, Lynne, and the entire DRL team for your tireless support in
connection with the recent Community of Democracies meeting. The Secretary's speech was superb. I was sitting with
representatives of "embattled NGOs" in the balcony of the Slowacki Theater, and many were literally awe-struck. They
told me that it was the most important, most inspirational speech they had ever heard relating to civil society. I agree.




I realize that considerable behind-the-scenes work goes into a speech like this. While civil society has an important role
in critiquing governmental actions, I also think that it's important to recognize the efforts of our remarkable colleagues
in government. So please allow me to say "thank you" to you and your team. Please also know that you can count on
ICNL to redouble its efforts - within the CD Working Group and otherwise - to advance the objectives set forth in
Krakow. Indeed, I've already met with the Working Group and have reached out to other partners to ensure that civil
society properly complements the tireless efforts you and your team have displayed in protecting civic space around the
world.




With best regards,
