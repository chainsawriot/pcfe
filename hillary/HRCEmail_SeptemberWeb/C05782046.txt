Almost everything is getting better
August 10th, 02011 by Kirk Citron

The Long News: stories that might still matter fifty, or a hundred, or ten thousand years from now.




Last week The Millennium Project released its 02011 State Of The Future report, looking at trends for the past
twenty years and projecting ahead for the next decade. (Not the 10,000 year future, but still of interest.) You can
read an executive summary of the report here.

While the report finds many things to worry about — global warming, terrorism, corruption — overall the trends
are surprisingly hopeful, as shown in their chart called "Where we are winning":
