Subject: Two Egypt security men killed in Israeli border raid (Reuters)

(Reuters) - Two Egyptian Central Security personnel were killed during an Israeli raid on militants along the
Egyptian Israeli border, an Egyptian army official told Reuters on Thursday.

  The army official said the security men were killed as Israeli forces chased militants along the border of
Egypt's Red Sea resort of Taba and the Israeli city of Eilat.

   "An Israeli plane had been chasing militant infiltrators along the border between Taba and Eliat and one
Egyptian Central Security officer and a Central Security man were caught in the line of fire," the army official
said.
