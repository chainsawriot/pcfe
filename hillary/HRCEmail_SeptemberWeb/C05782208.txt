Subject:                         SA update from don gips



I just left a meeting with Dep Minister Ebrahim which included other Ambassadors where there was a sustained attack
on the NATO approach to Libya and how this was all motivated by pursuit of oil. The AU approach is the only way. These
are the same points made by Mac Maharaj Presidential Spokesperson, in a radio interview that was happening
simultaneously.

I spoke up and countered the points in the meeting but was the only Nato amb present so was outnumbered.

After the meeting I met one on one with Ebrahim
