Huma, S Specials:

The Secretary briefed me on her call with Elie Wiesel yesterday. Please let her know that
Ambassador Sam Kaplan and Elie Wiesel have now been in contact (and they know each
other from years ago). Ambassador Kaplan is arranging for private security for Mr. Wiesel in
Morocco, and the two of them are discussing other details regarding the issues raised with
S. So no follow-up needed from S; the connections are made.

Cheers,

Jeff
