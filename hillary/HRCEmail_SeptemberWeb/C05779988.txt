If anyone needs this information----the phone contacts for General Abdul Fatah Younis, Libya's minister of interior and
Qaddafi's No. 2 who resigned yesterday are as follows:

                    home
                    â€”mobile
                    --office

Apparently, he wants to be a player in new regime...
