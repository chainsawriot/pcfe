Subject: Lebanese lawmakers back Hezbollah candidate for PM (AP)

BEIRUT (AP) - A majority of Lebanese lawmakers voted to support the candidate for prime minister backed by
Iranian ally Hizballah.
   By the end of voting January 25, Najib Mikati had 68 votes. Caretaker Prime Minister Saad Hariri had 60.
   The Shiite militant group is now in position to control Lebanon's next government. The move has set off
angry protests and drew warnings from the U.S. that its support could be in jeopardy.
   Thousands of Sunnis waved flags, burned tires and torched a van belonging to Al-Jazeera on January
25 during a "day of rage" to protest the gains by Hezbollah.
