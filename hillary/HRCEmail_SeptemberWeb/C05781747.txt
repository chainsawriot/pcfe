Subject: Barred Libyan Tanker May Be Diverted To Benghazi - Sources (WSJ)

LONDON (Dow Jones)--An oil-products tanker that was barred to reach the regime of Libya's Col. Moarrunar
Gadhafi now appears set to be diverted to the rebel-held capital of Benghazi, oil and opposition sources said
Wednesday.
The Cartagena, a tanker owned by state-controlled General National Maritime Transport Co., was prevented by
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to dock in Gadhafi-controlled Libya a few weeks ago. A GNMTC
spokesman didn't respond to a phone call for comment.

Fuel has been an important asset sought in the conflict between pro-Gadhafi forces and the rebel Transitional
National Council in Benghazi, and it's unclear how the tanker would end up in rebel hands.

Shipping tracking website Marine Traffic showed that the ship travelled in recent days south of Italy after being
unable to dock in Algeria, and was recently in the east of Malta. One person said the ship had turned up
unexpectedly for bunkering Tuesday night in Malta, while another said the tanker was taken over with the
assistance of a foreign nation.
