Subject: Rally for the Congo in front of HST this Friday

FYI on tomorrow's gathering. It's a group of activists who are respectful of the administration but want S to do more in
the DRC. They want a Special Envoy appointed now (highlighted the purpose below). State's official response has been
to not recommend a Special Envoy at this time. No idea how many people will actually show up tomorrow — the Congo
desk officer is skeptical they will have enough support to surround the building.

As a side note, AFSA is organizing,a 'rally to serve America' for government employees outside of the 21' street entrance
tomorrow as well.

Hi Everyone,

I'm writing to let you know about a rally, JOIN HANDS FOR CONGO, which is taking place in front of the State
Department on Friday, April 8th, at noon. We want to attract enough people to be able to form a human chain around the
DOS!

The rally is being sponsored by the Dear Hillary Campaign for the Congo
(www.dearhillanicampaign.wordoress.com) a student-led, nation-wide, grassroots movement targeting Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton on behalf of the people of eastern Congo. Last fall, on Oct. 26, Secretary Clinton's birthday, 56 Dear
Hillary Chapters (throughout the U.S. and in four foreign countries) showed Lisa Jackson's searing film, "The Greatest
Silence, Rape in the Congo" and signed and mailed over 16,000 postcards to Secretary Clinton which combined birthday
greetings with a plea that she make peace in East Congo a foreign policy priority. As a result of our efforts, we were
invited to a meeting at the State Department with Ambassador Melanne Verveer on December 15. It was a good meeting,
but since then, the Obama administration has taken no significant• action on Congo. That's why this time, we are
having a demonstration on behalf of the Congolese people outside the State Department. There will be speeches,
drumming, and, with your help, a huge expression of solidarity. Our main demand echoes that of the Enough Project,
Friends of the Congo, and the Eastern Congo Initiative: a Special Envoy for the DRC.
