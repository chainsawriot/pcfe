Can a draft be delivered or faxed to me either tonight or early tomorrow am? The specials can arrange for that.

HRC

Attached is the ppt that AMS will give tomorrow at the A/S meeting. It likely will take most of the time to go thorough.

We are not handing out copies until others who are editing it have had the chance to go through it carefully.

If you have the chance, take a look through and make sure nothing is too problematic for flashing on the screen,
recognizing the goal is by the end of the day, to have a version that can be handed out on Weds to the Hill and
internally.
