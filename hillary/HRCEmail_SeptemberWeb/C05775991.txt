I won't be there for some of your meetings today;however, wanted you to know that Norwegians agreed to match our
contribution to facilitate high crime cases and forensics work in DRC. They have been consistently excellent partners and
are very happy about your announcement to do a national plan on 1325, where they have also led. At NATO yesterday, I
learned about their recently adopted action plan on 1325, which the Dep SG said will have application in Afgh.

For the OECD meeting today, know that their leadership has been very supportive of our efforts to get OECD to collect
better data on women and economy as this is important to accelerating economic growth by addressing existing
barriers to women's economic participation.

I had very good mtgs at EU on potential development partnerships and sharing of successful models for gender
mainstreaming. Many greetings extended to you from all your friends.

Heading to Ukraine in the snow!
