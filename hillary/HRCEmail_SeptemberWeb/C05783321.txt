Spent an hour or so with him today, in part one on one.




Najib, by the way, gave me a Hermes scarf for S. It is a Lebanese cedar print, and part of the proceeds from its sale went
toward reforestation of Lebanon. Good for Najib buying things that help his country. So if she wants to thank him for
the scarf, great.
