Subject: Cuba won't unilaterally free Gross (AP)



MEXICO CITY - (AP) A senior Cuban official says the United States should not expect Cuba to make a
unilateral humanitarian gesture to release an imprisoned American government contractor.
  Cuban Parliament President Ricardo Alarcon says expecting such a gesture of behalf of Alan Gross "is not
reasonable."
  Alarcon made the comments Sunday in an interview with The Associated Press.
  Gross was sentenced to 15 years in prison in March for crimes against the state. He was arrested in Cuba in
December 2009 after being caught illegally bringing communications equipment onto the island while on a
USAID-funded democracy building program.
