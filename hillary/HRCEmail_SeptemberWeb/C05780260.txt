RAMALLAH (AP) - The French foreign minister says he's inviting Israeli and Palestinian leaders to Paris this
month to relaunch the peace talks.
   Alain Juppe says that "there's a sense of urgency" and that the "status quo is unsustainable."
   Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad met with Juppe on Thursday but would not say whether the
Palestinians would accept the invitation.
   Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said he would not comment before Juppe meets with Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later in the day.
   Talks collapsed in late 2008, reviving only briefly last September before breaking down over Israeli
settlement construction.
   In the meantime, Palestinians are trying to muster U.N. support for a unilateral declaration of statehood.
