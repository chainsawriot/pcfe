Subject: Timing our Response

Jake, Daniel and I spoke. I agree with his view that a statement by us that tries to capture a Pal 'yes' before the Arabs
meet could make Abbas' task harder, not easier. Appearing to preempt the Arabs could make some cranky leaders
crankier. But we should be ready with something for right after. Daniel may have more.
