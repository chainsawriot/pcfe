Subject:                           "Webchat"



I'm calling it a webchat for lack of a better name, but the idea was/is to solicit questions via video and text, show them
to you, have you answer. While we managed to do the regional interviews, we never got around to this, in part because
of some technical issues that we've since worked through. So we're hoping that you're still up for doing this, ideally next
Wednesday, for 30 mins tops. Reason I'm asking now is because the media outlet we'd partner with to solicit, choose
and pose the questions would like to start gathering questions today at a large march in Egypt, a ripe time and place to
solicit questions for you.
