Spoke to              earlier who owns property and does business in egypt. He's urging you to consider convening hbj,         B6
mbz and others, ask them to go to egpyt to convince M to turn everything over to OS entirely. And you should take
credit for orchestrating it. He seems to think they are looking for a way to show leadership like this for the sake of self-
preservation.
