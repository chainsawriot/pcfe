I just heard back from Mark -- due to crew rest issues today, they cannot move our departure time earlier and we have
to keep with 5:00pm. We will monitor storms so you don't leave home too early if something is rolling through.

I have a bad feeling about weather so I'd rather leave earlier than 6. Thx.

    I'm worried about the weather forecasts for thunderstorms. Can you pls check if I should leave earlier (or later?) to be
    safe?

    They can basically do whatever you'd like -- should we say 6:00pm?

    Bill can't get home until late tomorrow so is there any chance could either leave later or take a later shuttle?
