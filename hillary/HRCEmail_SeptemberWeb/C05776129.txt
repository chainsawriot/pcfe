Dear Cheryl:




Jean-Louis and I had a lengthy conversation today covering a broad range of subjects relating to your interest in
supporting textile and apparel activity in Haiti. He has subsequently shared with me a number of specific materials on
the Haiti project, including an email of yours which highlights the objectives of the project and a suggested timeline, as

well as the business proposal made by Hansoll. When I digest these latter materials, I will consider myself in a much
better position to make responsive recommendations to you.




As I communicated to Jean-Louis, I am happy to be helpful to you and the State Department on this project. I can make
myself available a couple of days a month for meetings and pretty much on an as needed basis for phone conversations.
I retain my affiliation with Warburg Pincus, the global private equity firm. This requires my presence in New York
(generally) a couple of days a week. As I think you know, I am also Chairman of the Board of Campbell Soup Company.
This entails three or four days a month.




Fortunately, I am not really "retired." This means that I have some flexibility in how I spend my time. You should feel
free to call on me.




I retain my interest in and connections with the retail and apparel industry. While I am far from an expert on sourcing
and production of apparel and textiles, I have some relevant experience and many friends who will do their best to keep
me from looking foolish.
                     â– 




I will be in Baltimore and Washington for the next few days. Either you or Jean-Louis should feel comfortable in calling
on my cell phone                 . In the interim, I will review these materials and speak again with Jean-Louis.




Regards,




Paul
