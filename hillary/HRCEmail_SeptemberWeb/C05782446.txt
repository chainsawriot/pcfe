My fyi was referring to the Libyan. The arming the rebels breathlessness is silly.

         now says the issue of the visitor is "more complicated than they thought" and he prefers to send me a secure
message in the morning. Will let you know.
Meanwhile, press here all about whether US/coalition going to "arm rebels" based on HRC comments about "no
decision yet, resolution allows that". Tomorrow's Guardian headline is "Coalition ready to arm rebellion if Gadafy clings
to power". Don't know if playing same way back home.
