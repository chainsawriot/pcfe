MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia called for an end to violence in Libya on Monday, citing what it said were
opposition reports of several hundred deaths in unrest.

   "We call on all sides in Libya to peacefully resolve existing problems, on the path to a responsible and broad
national dialogue and the conduct of necessary reforms," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. "In
any case, the violence must be stopped."
