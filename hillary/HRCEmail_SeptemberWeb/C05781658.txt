Cheryl:

Interesting exchange. Yellow Fever is a live attenuated vaccine that does cause mild HA, mild myalgias, low grade
temperature (<38.5 or 101), in <5% of cases.

In infants < 9 month you generally don't give vaccine for fear of their immature immune response could disseminate the
virus and cause an encephalitis (especially <4mo). People who are immunosuppressed from active lymphoma, leukemia,
disseminated cancer, or on chemotherapy or post transplant immunosuppressors, should avoid. HIV patients in late
stage disease (<cd4 <200) might not immunize, but I have doe it to HIV + with low CD 4 cells (<50) when they had to go
into high risk areas and could not avoid mosquitoes. Someone with an allergy to eggs (if they can eat eggs them they
should get immunized).

I would also note that protection from yellow fever vaccine is long. It is recommended you boost every by but
"neutralizing antibody" is known to persist for > 30 years in patients with only one immunization and perhaps for life in
those with one or more booster shots. He very well may hold immunity from his prior shots, almost certainly if within
last 10y.

      Raj/Jonathan:

I want to flag for you that one of the commitments S made was that she would ask a team of senior advisors to sit with
Meles' team to help work through how Ethiopia might implement the recommendations she shared for policy changes
that would yield long-term benefits for hunger in the region.

The goal is to have you all travel to the region after preparation to provide this assistance. I am assuming you all can
coordinate to ensure an effective and collaborative trip.

Please let me know this travel won't work for you all in the near term.

Many thanks.
