Subject: Call from Han Song Ryol

SBU

DPRK Deputy UN Permrep Han Song Ryol called Ford Hart late this morning while Ford was
driving on the first day of his leave. Ford dictated this readout to me after having briefed
Syd

Han said that Kim Kye Gwan was about to leave NY for Beijing at noon. Han said that KKG
had asked that he call Ford to see if there were any new developments on food aid.

Ford responded that there were not, noting that he had conveyed to Han on Friday that we
were available if the DPRK had further questions and that we had not heard
anything. Noting last week's discussions, Ford stressed that the ball is in the DPRK's court and
that we look forward to hearing a response from Pyongyang.
