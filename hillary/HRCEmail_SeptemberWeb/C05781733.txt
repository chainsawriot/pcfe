Subject: Yemen's Saleh conditionally welcomes transition plan (Reuters)

SANAA (Reuters) - Yemen's President Ali Abdullah Saleh welcomed a Gulf Cooperation Council initiative for
a power transfer, but said it must fit with constitutional laws, suggesting he may try to stay in power until his
term ends in 2013.
   "We welcome the initiative from the Gulf Cooperation Council and we will deal with it positively within the
framework of the Yemeni constitution," Saleh told a crowd of supporters in Sanaa.
   According to Yemen's constitution, Saleh's five-year term of office expires in 2013. The GCC plan in its
current format seeks Saleh's resignation within a month of the initiative's enactment.
