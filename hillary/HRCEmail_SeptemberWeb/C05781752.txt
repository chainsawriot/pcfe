Subject:                            Thank you!



Thank you for the surprise birthday party. It gets better and better to be able to celebrate another year!
It was also a gift to the staff, many of whom have not been in your presence before. They are so devoted to you and their
work that I know this will only serve to spur them on. So thank you for being a most       .
generous co-conspirator.

Secondly, I don't know if you've had a chance yet to read the memo on a potential partnership to fight
cervical and breast cancer in the developing world through the distribution of the HPV vaccine. it is being spearheaded by
George and Laura Bush, as well as the Koman Foundation. The memo mentions that they would like to do the launch in
NY on Sept 15 just before the UN meeting on communicable diseases and they would like you to join them. However,
because their desire to partner with you is so strong and they realize you might not be able to go to NY in the middle of
the week, they are willing to do the launch at State, if you'd be interested in doing that. They anticipate having CEOs of
the drug companies who are bringing down the price of the vaccine, Melinda Gates, head of states coming to the UN
meeting, etc.
It could be a great bipartisan commitment.

We had a terrific meeting with President Sirleaf on education. I think there will opportunities to do more in Liberia once
your initiative is launched. Among her leader colleagues, she understands that just getting more children in school is not
enough if they are not learning. She's also secretly hoping (should all go well) that you'll be at her Inauguration in January.

I'm off to Rome tom'w for the FAO ministerial with its focus on gender and agriculture.     meet up with you in
Lithuania.Safe travels and many thanks.
