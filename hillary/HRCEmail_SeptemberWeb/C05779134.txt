Subject: From Sandy Berger- UNSC Resolution with different language

Jake,

Sandy's email is down temporarily. He asked that I forward the following to you:

The domestic firestorm would be the same, regardless of the language. Congress will not parse the words;
they will take the view that this is throwing Israel overboard. D's as well as R's. That will have consequences
for the generally bipartisan support of our handling of Egypt, and put the Administration on the defensive. It
will be seen as backtracking on our position—restated as recently as last week by Jim—that the UNSC is not
the place to litigate these issues.

Undoubtedly, vetoing a resolution that echoes US policy hurts our credibility in the region and undercuts the
forward-leaning posture we have cultivated over the past three weeks. That could feed the anti-American
currents and manifest itself on the streets of Ramallah or elsewhere.

Obviously, better if we can get the Pals to withdraw, including holding out the prospect of putting forward
TORs for negotiations. But if that is not successful, I come down—narrowly--on the side of veto. I know
what happens here if we abstain; I am not sure what happens in the region if we veto.

If that is where you come out, it may be better not to change the language. And we certainly should try to get
something from Bibi—on the g round or in his negotiating positions.

-Sandy
