Subject: Israel seeking formula for Palestinian talks (AP)



 UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Israel's defense minister says his government is trying to find "a formula" that will
enable Mideast peace mediators to agree on a way to revive Israeli-Palestinian talks.
  Ehud Barak told reporters after meeting U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Friday: "I cannot promise
you that it will happen, but we are still trying to do our best to enable it."
  Diplomats from the so-called "Quartet" _ the U.S., U.N., European Union and Russia _ failed earlier this
month to find a basis for moving the peace process forward.
  "We are still trying to find a formula that will enable understanding between the members of the Quartet in a
way that will enable resumption of negotiations," Barak said.
