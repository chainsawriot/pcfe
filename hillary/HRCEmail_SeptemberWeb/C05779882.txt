Subject: Discussion with Jibril

Jibril called me to say that he had to attend the Doha Conference on the 13-there was no way he could miss it
and therefore might have to postpone visit to Washington. I told him that if he did that he would not be able
to meet Kerry and others until the beginning of May. I also told him Ali Aujali was aware of the conflict and
was trying to fi gure out a flight that would both allow him to attend Doha and get here for meetings on the
14th.
