Subject: Kerry: alliance with Pakistan at 'critical moment' (AP)

KABUL, Afghanistan - (AP) U.S. Sen. John Kerry says the U.S. relationship with Pakistan is at a "critical
moment" because of the killing of Osama bin Laden.
  Kerry, chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was speaking Sunday in the Afghan
capital. He is visiting both Afghanistan and Pakistan to repair relations following the unilateral strike against
bin Laden.
   He said that there was some evidence of Pakistani knowledge of Taliban sanctuaries in Pakistan, a finding
that he called disturbing.
   But he also said that bin Laden's death may present a new opportunity for reconciliation with the Taliban in
Afghanistan.
   Kerry is expected to continue on to Pakistan later Sunday.
