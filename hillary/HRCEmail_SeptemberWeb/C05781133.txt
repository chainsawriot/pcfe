â€¢ Ms- my apologies. I just called bernadette for clarification. She said that it went to the house WITH your book/IN the
 pouch. She says inside the pouch/on top of your book she put 2 items: the rudd call sheet and a follow-up from the
 david hale meeting. If you cannot find it I can have it faxed to your dc house, if your fax is operable.
