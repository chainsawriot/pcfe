Subject: Pakistan's ex-FM urges resignations over bin Laden (AP)

ISLAMABAD (AP) - Pakistan's former foreign minister has called on the country's president and prime
minister to resign following the American raid that killed Osama bin Laden.
   Shah Mahmood Qureshi says the operation was a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty, and President Asif Ali
Zardari and Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani should be held responsible.
   Qureshi is one of the highest-profile figures yet to demand senior officials be held accountable for Monday's
raid in Abbottabad, an army town just two-and-a-half hours' drive from the capital, Islamabad.
   Qureshi, now a lawmaker for the ruling Pakistan People's Party, spoke to Geo TV on Saturday.
   Other Pakistanis have focused their anger on the country's powerful army and intelligence chiefs.
