Subject: Hezbollah says U.S. using tribunal to undermine Lebanon (Reuters)

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Hezbollah's al-Manar television said January 17 the United States was behind the release
of a draft indictment over the 2005 killing of Rafik al-Hariri in order to sabotage efforts to solve Lebanon's
crisis.
    It accused Washington of "pushing the indictment ahead to light the fuse to blow up the bridges for a
solution", adding that the "Americans control the indictments in form and content."
