Subject: FW: Lavrov's presentation today

FYI – Lavrov gave a speech today with the following key themes:

            -   The US needs to respect democracy and rule of law internationally. (i.e., respect the rules and provide
                others more of a say.)

            -   A Europe truly whole should have no dividing lines.

                Core principles for US-Russian relations should be indivisibility of security, mutual respect, and taking
                into account the other side's views. We are still waiting to see US rhetoric translated into practical
                deeds.

            -   Russia's proposed European Security Treaty would merely formalize what previous agreements have
                averred—e.g., that no one should attempt to increase their security at the expense of others. In this
                respect, missile defense embodies cores issues at the heart of EST.

            –   WTO: "we are sick and tired" of new demands. "We're nearing the moment of truth."
