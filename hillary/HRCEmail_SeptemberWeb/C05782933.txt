Subject: Kenya, Somalia security officials plot al Shabaab offensive (Reuters)


ISIOLO (Reuters) - Kenyan and Somali security officials met in the Somali border town of Dhobley on Sunday
to discuss preparations for an offensive against al Shabaab rebels after the kidnapping of two Spanish aid
workers, a Kenyan security source said.

   The meeting comes a day after Kenya said it would hunt down the al Qaeda-linked insurgents, who police
believe seized the two Medecins Sans Frontiers staffers at the Dadaab refugee camp last week.

    Al Shabaab denied it was responsible.

   "A team comprising Kenya Army and Rapid Deployment Unit (police) officers left our border last evening
and went to Dhobley. They held a meeting with top officers of the TFG (Somali) forces for about two hours
before they came back," the security source said.

   "The meeting was to prepare a joint operation between the two forces which is meant to launch an offensive
against al Shabaablebels who are scattered in different parts of southern Somalia," he added, without giving
further details.
