Subject: Russia says has Gaddafi contacts to discuss departure (Reuters)

DEAUVILLE, France, May 27 (Reuters) - Russia has contacts in Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's entourage
with whom it can negotiate his departure, Moscow's special representative on Africa Mikhail Margelov said on
Friday.

   "We shouldn't talk to Gaddafi himself but with members of his cabinet, possibly with his sons. And we are
making such contacts, so there is a hope for a political resolution," Margelov told reporters at the G8 summit in
northern France.

    Asked to specify who Russia's main partner would be in such talks, he said: "Can you imagine, if! give you
this person's name and his head were to be cut off the next day?

    "But yes, we do have people in Gaddafi's camp."

   Russia says its G8 partners have suggested it take a mediation role in the Libyan crisis, although that has not
been confirmed by other officials at the Deauville meeting. Russia has criticised the Western powers bombing
campaign but has agreed with its G8 partners that Gaddafi should step aside.
