I understand perfectly, Cheryl, that there are more pressing priorities than the International Fund for Ireland and
you may need Rep. King for one or more of these, but in that he has committed to going to bat for the Fund, as a
personal mission, it may not be a loss of "political capital" to follow up with him. In calls from King's staff,
specifically Adam Paulson, they communicated to me that because of his Irish constituency, Rep. King does not
want to be associated with denying the Irish funding. Rep. King sounded confident, in his conversations with
me over St. Patrick's Day, that he had a lot of clout with Boeluter, so perhaps the Ireland Fund could be
combined with your other priorities, to harness his senior influence in the Party, and restore funding to several
programs. I know he reveres Secretary Clinton and he expresses great pride that he worked alongside her on the
Irish peace process.
Thank you for your characteristically prompt reply to my request. Gratefully, Stella

       Thanks for this

        Will see what we can do - we are in the budget fight of our lives (5B being taken out of a 48B budget for
        State/USAID) so not sure how "use of political capital" wise this fits but will try.

           I come to crave a favor. As the Secretary will know the Republicans zeroed the funding for the
           International Fund for Ireland for 2011. This was done at the prompting of Glenn Beck, Rep.
           Chaffetz of Utah and Trina Vargo. I spent this week cajoling our Republican friends on the Hill
           i.e. Reps. Peter King, Chris Smith and Tim Murphy, to restore all or part of the funding as the
           budget is being finalized this week. Congressman King has promised to try to do so by talking
           with Boehner. Would it be possible for Secretary Clinton to give Congressman King a call, to

 remind him of her support for the Fund, and thus strengthen King's resolve to restore funding?

 Thank you.
