Madam Secretary,

I am not sure if Huma has contacted you already, but wanted to let you know that Netanyahu's office has informed Ops
that he is no longer available to speak at 7:30am this morning. We are awaiting new call windows from his office, and
will advise when We have another option for the call.

Thank you,
Bernadette
