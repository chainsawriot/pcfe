Subject: Arab League chief may go to Syria this week (Reuters)


CAIRO (Reuters) - Arab League chief Nabil Elaraby said on Sunday he could visit Syria this week to voice
Arab worries about violence there after Damascus sent troops and tanks to crush street protests against President
Bashar al-Assad's rule

   "The Syrian government told me that it welcomes the visit of the secretary-general at any time, and it will
probably be this week," the secretary-general told a news conference in Cairo.

    "I did not ask for guarantees and will communicate the Arab worries about the incidents in Syria and listen
to the opinion of the Syrian authorities," he said.
