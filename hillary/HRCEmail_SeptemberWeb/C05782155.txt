Background: On August 8, the United States asked the UNSC's Libya Sanctions Committee to grant an asset freeze
exemption to allow us to unfreeze certain Libyan assets for urgently-needed humanitarian assistance. On August 15, the
South Africa mission asked the Committee for more time to consider the proposal, effectively preventing the Committee
from agreeing to the exemption. Only South Africa and India objected. India today (August 22) withdrew its
objections.




                                                                                                   Minister Mashabane held
a press conference this morning where she said that South Africa is not prepared to recognize the TNC as the legitimate
government: ."We have no reason to create a state within a state. If this government falls, there is no government, but
we know there were discussions about a transitional authority in Libya, which will include elements of Tripoli and the
rebels' Transitional National Council." She also said "the South African government is closely watching the rapidly
unfolding situation in the Libyan capital of Tripoli. With the imminent fall of the government of Colonel Gaddafi, we
wish to urge the interim authority in Tripoli to immediately institute an all-inclusive inter-Libyan political dialogue aimed
at building a truly representative and people-centered dispensation." The AU Peace and Security Council held an
emergency meeting today but deferred action to Friday, when the heads of state meet.
