As you know I have good links to the Qataris. Sheikha Mosah's son is the 31/32 year old Crown Prince and she is keen
that he starts to build a wider international profile. He has been appointed head of the Qatar National Food Security
Programme which is designed to deal with Qatar's food security issues its a $30 billion programme. He is aware that
food security is an issue you are majoring on and would love to meet with you in person to discuss this and to explore
potential partnership areas between US and Qatar including possible participation in the US/World Bank Food Security
Fund. He is also keen to talk more generally about US/Qatari cooperation and even suggested they could help out with

the Oil spill problem. There is apparently a Arab Food Security Summit in October 2010 and he would like to discuss Us
participation in that too.

IS a meeting possible                                                        Or maybe we could set up an initial phone
call.

Can you let me know if this appeals to you at all?
