Cheryl — Many thanks for securing my participation in bilateral meetings — it has made a real difference. I've
been a much more productive member of the S team over the last few days and am acquiring a body of
knowledge that will be helpful in shaping paper for S and anticipating some of her preferences. I'm keeping
Jake apprised of the substance of the sessions, and am looping back to Huma on the scheduling and other issues
that affect her planning. Maybe we can touch base after the Italy trip? Cheers,

Alice G. Wells
