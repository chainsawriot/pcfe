Subject: Libya army to give rebels chance to surrender-TV (Reuters)


CAIRO (Reuters) - Libya's armed forces said it would stop military operations on Sunday to give rebels a
chance to surrender, Al Arabiya TV reported on Thursday, without giving further details about the offer.

   Muammar Gaddafi's forces launched air strikes on the outskirts of the rebel-held city of Benghazi on
Thursday. Rebels also reported fighting in Ajdabiyah, south of Benghazi, between rebel forces and Gaddafi's
troops.
