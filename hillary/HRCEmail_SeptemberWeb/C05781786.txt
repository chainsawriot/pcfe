Subject: Two explosions rock Gaza City (AP)


GAZA CITY (AP) - Explosions have taken place in two places in Gaza City, in the Palestinian territory of
Gaza.
  Gaza security officials attributed the blasts early Friday to Israeli airstrikes on a home and a security
compound. A Gaza hospital official said a 13-year-old boy was killed and 10 people were wounded.
  There was no Israeli military confirmation of airstrikes a day after Israel accused Gaza militants of infiltrating
southern Israel from Egypt and carrying out a series of coordinated attacks that killed seven Israelis.
