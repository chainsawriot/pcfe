Subject: How Wonderful to meet Bill



I am in NY.

I was at the Rockefeller Foundation Award ceremony where Bill Clinton was awarded the life-time achievement award.
He gave a very inspiring and insightful speech. He elaborately mentioned my relationship with him and his commitment
to microcredit since Arkansas days.

I was amazed by his detailed memory of those years and his actions for promoting microcredit when he became
President.                                                                                                             B1
                                                                                                                       1.4(D)


I hope I can see Hillary when I come to DC in about two weeks.

Best

Yunus
