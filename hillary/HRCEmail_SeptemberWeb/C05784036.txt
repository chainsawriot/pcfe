                   "Now that the emergency law has been lifted, the time has come to
                   change our constitutional arrangements, with a new constitution
                   that implements the best ofwhat we now have, and ensures that
                   new structures and arrangements are put in place for a new era of
                   peace, democracy, equality, separation ofpowers, rule of law,
                   pluralism, freedom of expression and the dignity of every Syrian
                   citizen. These fundamental principles, rights and freedoms should
                   not only be proclaimed on paper, but should be fully implemented
                   in practice.
                   1 am now establishing an independent Commission, composed of 9
                   experts, to draft a new constitution containing the above-
                   mentioned principles. The Commission will work in a transparent
                   and open manner, and has the right to consult with whomever it
                   will. The draft Constitution will be submitted to a national
                   referendum as soon as possible.
                    The new Constitution will adopt the following guidelines:
                    1) The introduction of a competitive, multi-party political system.
                    2) Enfbrcement of the principles of the separation of powers
                       between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of
                       government.
                    3) Redistribution ofpower in favour of a more representative
                       system of government.
                    4) Strengthening the independence of the judicial system,
                       including the Supreme Judicial Council and the Supreme
                       Constitutional Court, to uphold the rights and freedoms of the
                       people."
