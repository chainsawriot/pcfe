Colleagues, I think that we should all meet this afternoon as soon as Ken Merten lands. It could be here at LogBase, if
you wish. Please let me know of your availability. We are also analyzing the data,

Colleagues,

It looks like our friends in the CEP may have made another misstep. I am on my way back
to Haiti, but if I understand this correctly, the CEP would have had to overturn 17 races
to give mite the absolute majority in the Chamber,. which is what seems to have
happened. Is that correct? If so, I think that at a minimum we should not issue any
statements congratulating the Haitian government on the result. I also wonder what
recourse candidates may have at this stage. For our part, the U.S. is trying to get the
facts and will then consider what options we have at our disposal. I hope we can talk
about this soon. I should be back in Haiti around 14h00 today.
