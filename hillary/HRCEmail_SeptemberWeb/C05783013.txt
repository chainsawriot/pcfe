Subject: Iran says US claim of plot has 'no legal logic' (AP)

TEHRAN (AP) - Iran's Foreign Ministry says U.S. claims that Tehran was involved in a plot to assassinate the
Saudi ambassador in Washington have no "legal logic."
  The ministry, in a statement on the state news agency Saturday, says the Iranian government has no
connection to Manssor Arbabsiar, the man arrested in the alleged plot.
  It says U.S. accusations of Iran's involvement "without showing documentation" are "in no way compatible
with legal logic."
  It says the claims, "put together based on statements, guesses and suppositions by individuals involved in
drug smuggling" would never stand up in a "proper courtroom."
  President Barack Obama said Thursday that the U.S. will be able to support all of its allegations of Iranian
involvement.
