Cheryl,


Say hi to the Secretary and I hope you are doing well.


Just a note to say I'm going to be at the breakfast featuring HRC tomorrow morning in NYC at the Economic
Club of NYC.


Are you coming? It would be great to catch up briefly, since in addition to all the global projects we have
started (including Central Party School in Beijing and US/India education agreements), there are other new
opportunities for which I'd like to get your insights.

Warm regards,

Jerry
