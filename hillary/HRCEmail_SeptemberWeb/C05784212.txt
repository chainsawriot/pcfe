Subject: Interior minister says Mubarak too frail to move (AP)


CAIRO (AP) - Egypt's top security official has recommended that ousted President Hosni Mubarak not be
moved from the hospital where he is kept under arrest at the Red Sea resort of Shann el-Sheikh.
  In a statement, the prosecutor general's office said Interior Minister Mansour el-Issawi has cited Mubarak's
poor health as the reason he should not be moved as planned to a military hospital in Cairo.
  In a letter to the prosecutor general released late Tuesday, el-Issawi said moving him would threaten his
health and safety.
