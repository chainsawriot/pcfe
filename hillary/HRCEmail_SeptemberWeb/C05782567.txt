Subject: Army experts defuse bomb in center of Belfast (AP)


LONDON (AP) - Police in Northern Ireland say a live bomb has been found in a busy part of Belfast.
   The Police Service of Northern Ireland says the bomb was "capable of causing death or serious injury."
   Homes and businesses were evacuated after the bomb was discovered late Friday in an area full of bars and
restaurants.
   Police said Saturday that the device was made safe by army bomb-disposal experts in a controlled explosion.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
   Irish Republican Army dissidents opposed to the province's peace process have attempted a number of recent
bombings and shootings, though few have killed anyone. In April, dissidents killed a Catholic policeman with a
booby-trap bomb under his car.
