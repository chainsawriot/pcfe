"Earlier in the day Boulos and seven other prominent business people met with Preval and urged him to adopt the OAS'
recommendations. Preval has been pushing for cancellation of the presidential elections, a move opposed by the United
States, the U.N. peacekeeping mission, Brazil and others." MIAMI HERALD

Cheryl,

We believe that our "behind the doors actions" have been so far more effective than the usual public
statements of the past. The business community has played a major role in helping to get the November 28
elections back on track, by convincing President Preval to request the OAS mission, by publicly denouncing the
results of the 1st round, and as late as yesterday morning (3 hours meeting with Preval) by convincing him to
drop the idea of annulment of the elections.

As you know, President Preval has not been happy about the position of the Private Sector. But to his credit,
he has kept the dialogue open with us. For the first time in a long time, the position of the Haitian Private
Sector is based on principles and not particular interests. As I mention to you many times, we need your
support to continue to build a strong and ethical Private Sector. Everyone in the diplomatic circles and among
the Haitian political leaders will confirm the role played by the Private Sector Economic Forum over the past 6
months. Our published polls ( controversial for some) has contributed in modernizing the way elections are
monitored as the results confirmed the quality of the polls and the OAS results were consistent with the quick
counts we organized on November 28.

 On behalf of the Haitian Private Sector, I want to thank you for the commitment you have shown toward Haiti
•and the long hours and days you have spent promoting the reconstruction efforts.

My best Regards,

Reggie
