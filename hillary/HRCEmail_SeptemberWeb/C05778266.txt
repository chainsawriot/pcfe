Subject:                           The speech



I apologize, but now that I am really focussed on it, I have some problems.

First, and easy to address, the long intro needs tightening and editing.



Maybe I'm wicki whacked out, but I'm trying to read everything from a hypercriticial view. \




I hope this makes sense--we should talk later in the morning.
