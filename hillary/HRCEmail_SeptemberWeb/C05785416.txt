Subject: Nato choppers again violate Pakistani airspace in North Waziristan (Pakistan's The Nation)




Pakistan's The Nation: The NATO continues to violate Pakistani airspace as two helicopters again intruded into
the Pakistani territory on Monday.
Sources said that two NATO choppers entered the Pakistani airspace to hunt militants in border area of North
Waziristan Agency. The NATO helicopters entered the border area, claiming that five members of Haqqani
network have been arrested after the search operation.
It is worth mentioning here that two NATO helicopters had violated Pakistan's airspace at Admi Kot post in
North Waziristan Agency last week and had fired at the army check post, injuring two security personnel.
Meanwhile, tribesmen and citizens have expressed their anguish over repeated violation of NATO at border
areas. Criticizing the suspicious silence of country's leadership over NATO violations, they said that
sovereignty of the country has been ruined in the hands of politicians who have nothing to do except
safeguarding personal interests and increasing bank balances and properties.
They urged the armed forces to appropriately retaliate the violation by NATO forces so as to assure the
countrymen that they were in safe hands.
