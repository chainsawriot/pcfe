Subject: Talking with PM Odinga

Dear Cheryl and Johnnie,

I spent eight hours yesterday with directly PM Odinga, traveling in his vehicle as we toured the refugee camps at
Dadaab, walking next to him as we talked with refugees in the hospital and reception center, sitting with him and FM
Saitoti during meals, and sitting next to him on his private plane en route back to Nairobi (during which we talked one on
one for an hour).

You will get detailed readouts through channels, but in summary he is deeply seized with this crisis in Somalia and
decided on the spot to open the long-promised IfÂ° ll camp, something the international community has been asked for
at least two years now.

But specifically, I'm writing to let you know that at the end of the trip, the PM specifically asked me to pass his kind
regards to Secretary Clinton and A/S Carson - "Hillary" and "Johnnie" as he said.

I'll be back in the office on Monday and happy to talk more about conversation with the PM if you'd like.

-Reuben
