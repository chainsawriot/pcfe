Subject: Obama's meets with Dalai Lama; Chinese complain (AP)

WASHINGTON (AP) - President Barack Obama is meeting with the Dalai Lama - a fellow Nobel Peace
laureate - and China isn't happy.
   The Tibetan spiritual leader has been in Washington for an 11-day Buddhist ritual. Thousands of expatriate
Tibetans joined a 76th birthday celebration Wednesday for the Dalai Lama, who's just relinquished leadership
of Tibet's government-in-exile.
   The White House says Saturday's private meeting in the Map Room shows Obama's support for preserving
Tibet's culture and protecting human rights.
   A Chinese crackdown led the Dalai Lama to flee into exile in India in 1959. China says he's welcome to
return if he drops his separatist activities, accepts Tibet as an inalienable part of China and recognizes Taiwan
as a province of China.
   Obama last met the Dalai Lama in February 2010.
