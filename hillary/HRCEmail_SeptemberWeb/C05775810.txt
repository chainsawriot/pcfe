Thx. I look forward to reading it. What you're doing and leading is so important--despite the challenges! Let's go to
dinner and share war stories whenever our crazy schedules permit. All best-H

Subject: FW: AF/PDPA Organizational Development Plan




As you may be aware, earlier this year, OIG issued a very negative report on our Public Diplomacy operations
throughout Africa. I have attached a copy of the action plan which Johnnie and his team developed to address the
issues raised in the report. The plan is a very deliberate effort to address the shortcomings identified by the 01G, do a
better job of integrating public diplomacy and public affairs into the whole AF Bureau, and deliver better PD and PA
work.




I think it is an excellent report and provides a good model for the bureaus as we endeavor to create a new direction for
Public Diplomacy.
