I just got the final draft and it looks like your suggestions were included.

I have suggested to Dan the following edit to the grafs on page 2 (not sure why the fonts are showing up different here,
but you'll get the idea....I can improve the language but wanted to give you a sense of what I think is still missing in his
latest draft).
