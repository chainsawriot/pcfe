Subject: Egypt says no to foreign election monitors (AP)


CAIRO - (AP) Egypt's ruling generals say foreigners won't be allowed to monitor upcoming elections but
there will be Egyptian observers.
   The decision was announced Wednesday as the military unveiled a law setting guidelines for Egypt's first
post-revolution parliamentary vote.
   Maj. Gen. Mamdouh Shaheen, a member of the military council that assumed control of the country after
Hosni Mubarak stepped down, says the army will announce a date for the elections by the end of next month.
   He says there won't be foreign monitors in order to protect the country's sovereignty.
   In a notable change from Mubarak's days, however, he says the judiciary will oversee the process, not the
Interior Ministry _ which often fixed the vote to help the ruling party.
