It has, as always, been a joy to have you on the team. We've worked together for so long, that I always feel better when
I know you're there--putting words in my mouth and watching my back.


I enjoyed our talk and was delighted to hear about all you're planning to do--especially on the sports front. Just goes to
show, once a jock always a jock!


Thx too for the rescue effort you're doing on the QDDR article.

I enjoyed our talk too, but forgot to mention the most important thing of all -- how much I appreciate your bringing me
to State and giving me this opportunity. I have learned so much, meant so many smart and capable people, and hope I
have contributed in some small way to what you are working so hard to accomplish.


  write a formal letter for ''the file" when I leave conveying ail of these thoughtsâ€ž but I wanted to say something in
person too.
Unfortunately, I got carried away on sports diplomacy and everything else and ....another senior moment!

   let you know when I have had a chance to talk to Judith and Ann about the ideas 4'm putting together on sports. I do
think there is potential to do much more than is being done now -- and more creatively.
