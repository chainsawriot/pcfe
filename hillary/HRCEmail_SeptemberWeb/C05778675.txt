UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki Moon held an extensive discussion with Libya
leader Muammar Gaddafi Monday, condemned the escalating violence in Libya and told him it "must stop
immediately," a U.N. spokesman said.

   "The Secretary-General expressed deep concern at the escalating scale of violence and emphasized that it
must stop immediately. He reiterated his call for respect for basic freedoms and human rights, including
peaceful assembly and information," the spokesman said.

   " ... The Secretary-General underlined the need to ensure the protection of the civilian population under any
circumstances. He urged all parties to exercise restraint and called upon the authorities to engage in broad-based
dialogue to address legitimate concerns of the population."
