Subject: Iran appoints new nuclear chief (AP)

TEHRAN (AP) - Iran's presidential office says a nuclear scientist who recently survived an assassination
attempt has been appointed the new head to the country's nuclear program.
   Fereidoun Abbasi, a 52-year-old professor of nuclear isotopes at Tehran's Defense Ministry, was seriously
wounded in a bomb attack in November.
   The statement which appeared on the website Sunday, said Iran's president appointed Abbasi as head of the
nuclear energy agency, succeeding Ali Akbar Salehi who earlier became foreign minister.
   Iran's nuclear chief is also automatically a vice president.
