I'd like to start Saeb mtg earlyâ€”at 10:30.

I'm worried that since Bibi call is on schedule for sometime btw 12:15 and 1:00 it could come right when I'm supposed to
see Livni at 1. That would be a problem.

Can you find out 1)if Bibi could do at 12:15 and, if not, tell them I won't have enough time if it can't be until 1 so 2)could
we do late tonight--at midnight my time or early Sat at 6am or noon?
