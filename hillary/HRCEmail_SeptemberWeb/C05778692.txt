Cheryl:

I am en route to Brazil with the Treasury Secretary. As I return to a week full of events (including our Economic
Partnership Dialogue, a visit by Nancy Powell, and the White House pre-advance team), I wanted to take a moment to
thank the Secretary and you for the Global Chiefs of Mission Conference.

I had a great time. The conference was substantive, relevant, and timely. I appreciated the big chunk of time the
Secretary dedicated to the conference, especially during a time of perilous crisis. I also appreciated the opportunity to
listen to Admiral Mullen and the Vice President. And I enjoyed the unique moment of camaraderie with all of my
counterparts (even if some of them were whiney).

And...I thought the presentation by Mr. Spence to be a stroke of genius. It scrambled everyone's expectations of the
conference and forced us to look at what we were doing in a very different way. The presentation is on its way to
becoming an urban legend within the bureaucracy. One Treasury official told me today, "I heard about the Spence
presentation. Very interesting. Not the kind of thing we would do at Treasury."

Thanks for sending such a clear message that our work is valued.

Regards,
Tom
