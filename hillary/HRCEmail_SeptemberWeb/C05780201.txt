Just watched it. They used about 4-5 minutes of it at three different points, including whether the sons were killed,
Cladafi reaching out to people, how long this would go on, the storyline of the boys vs the girls being silly, and how long
you'd stay in the job. Edited a little choppy but was pretty good.
