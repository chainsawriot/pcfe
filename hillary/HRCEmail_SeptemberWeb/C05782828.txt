                  Dipu Moni to meet Hillary on Oct 12
Foreign Minister Dipu Moni will meet with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in
Washington DC on October 12.


"Although there is no specific agenda for discussion with Hillary, the foreign minister is
expected to discuss bilateral issues, as well as regional and international issues with the
US secretary of state," said a source in the foreign ministry.


Dipu Moni left Dhaka yesterday for Kuwait to participate in a two-day event of the loth
ministerial meeting of the Asia Cooperation Dialogue (ACD) from October 10 to 11.


Sources said she will attend the opening ceremony of ACD, and then leave for USA to
take part in Bangladesh Brand Forum's seminar and a roundtable on Trade and
Investment Opportunities in Bangladesh on October


Dipu Moni had last held talks with Hillary during the UN General Assembly in
September 2009.


Sources said Dipu Moni may seek US assistance in repatriation of the condemned killers
of Bangabandhu to bring them to justice and US support for trial of war criminals.


She is also due to meet with several US Senators and Congressmen at Capital Hill. The
foreign minister will attend a reception to be hosted by the Bangladesh embassy in USA.


There was a move to arrange a brief meeting between Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and
US President Barack Obama or Hillary during this year's UN General Assembly. But
neither Hasina nor Dipu Moni got any appointment for a meeting, said sources.
