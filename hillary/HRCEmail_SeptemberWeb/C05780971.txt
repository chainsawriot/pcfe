Subject: Libyan conference


I spoke to Abdulrahman Shalgham this morning who appears to be organizing the Libyan conclave involving
reportedly 200-300 people in Rome at the Libyan Academy from the 24-26 of June. Purpose is to discuss the
way forward-a roadmap for when Qadhafi goes. As of now, they are not inviting observers but I noted
Secretary's interest and asked that I be proffered an invitation. He agreed, subject to making sure it was o.k.
with the other INC organizers. At this point, they may be trying to keep it under wraps to the extent they can.
Not sure whether Italians were backing it.
