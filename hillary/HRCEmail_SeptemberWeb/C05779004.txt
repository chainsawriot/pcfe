Subject: Lahore Sitrep: Sunday, 2/13

(U) Three stories dominate Sunday media, and they all have to do with the Davis case: the postponement of the
Trilateral; former FM Qureshi's assertion that he stood up for principle against American pressure; and Foreign
Secretary Bashir's statements that "U.S. pressure. . . would be counterproductive" and that "if I myself would
do something morally wrong, then I will not seek to protect myself under the figment of immunity."

(SBU)                                                                                         Almost papers
trumpeted his assertions that Davis is not a diplomat and that Secretary Clinton tried to "force" him to grant
immunity. Applauding Qureshi's courage in standing up to his own administration, Urdu dailies "Jang" and
"Express" agreed that he "has not been included in the cabinet because of his tough and uncompromising stance
on the Raymond Davis issue." TV tickers and some Urdu and English language papers carried the news that the
Punjab government turned down the U.S. Consulate in Lahore's request for "VIP facilities" for Davis, with one
ticker going as far as saying VIP treatment to a murderer violates basic human rights. Mass circulation Urdu
daily "Jang" and its sister English daily "The News" speculated that the cessation in what they called CIA-
sponsored U.S. drone attacks since Davis's arrest is significant.

(SBU) Leading English daily "Dawn" ran an op-ed by prominent novelist Mohsin Hamid that characterized
Davis as a 'trained killer" and "predator." Claiming to represent his "friends" (i.e., liberal intellectuals), he
concludes "No more Pakistani extremists. No more American killers. And if it comes to it, no more American
aid either."
