CHINESE AGENCY CUTS U.S. CREDIT RATING

(SBU) In downgrading the United States from A-plus to A, Dagong Global Credit Rating, a relative newcomer to the
sovereign debt rating realm, said the deal to lift the debt ceiling would not solve underlying U.S. debt problems or
improve its debt-paying ability over the long run, media report. Embassy Beijing comments the government owned
investment bank, China International Capital Corporation, pointedly and publicly disagreed with Dagong's downgrade.
While a number of well-informed economists inside and outside the Chinese government continue watching the U.S.
debt situation closely, they do not share Dagong's sentiments. (Ops/Embassy Beijing e-mail, Reuters

EGYPT'S MUBARAK ON TRIAL
(SBU) The former president was flown to Cairo and wheeled into the courtroom on a gurney to face charges of
corruption and conspiring to kill protesters, media report. Outside the trial venue, scuffles broke out between
hundreds of supporters and opponents of the ex-president. Embassy Cairo comments potential witnesses could
include Field Marshal Tantawi and former Vice President Suleiman. Live testimony likely will be presented,
thereby making the evidence more public and the proceedings more transparent than would be the case in a
normal trial. (Ops/Embassy Cairo e-mail, AP)

HAITIAN SENATE REJECTS PRESIDENT'S NOMINEE FOR PM
(SBU) The rejection of former Justice Minister Gousse was the second time President Martelly's choice for the
position was refused, according to press. Embassy Port-au-Prince comments the rejection demonstrates how the
power struggle between Martelly and parliament will continue to handicap the government until the issue is
resolved. One possible replacement nominee is Presidential Chief of Staff Mayard-Paul. (Ops/Embassy Port-

IRAQ SENTENCES THREE TO DEATH IN BAGHDAD CHURCH ATTACK
(SBU) The three men were found guilty of masterminding a 2010 church siege in which 68 people were killed,
according to press. Embassy Baghdad comments the sentence underscores a determined government effort to
improve protection for minority communities. However, the August 2 church bombing in Kirkuk demonstrates
significant challenges remain.
