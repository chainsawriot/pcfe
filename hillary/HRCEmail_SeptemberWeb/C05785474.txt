Sorry to have missed you. No updates other than they got a few words changed in the Sanger piece (like inserting your
name).

Call sheets should be coming your way for these Pak calls.

No word yet from Jerusalem - except all of the demonstrations for Nakba Day and the shootings across the Lebanese
and Syrian borders.

Also, did you find out if Kerry's email was accurately describing Karzai's intentions?

Just finished dinner with Karzai, Petraeus and Eikenberry. During my meeting with Karzai one on one prior to dinner he
agreed to end the special Tribunal confrontation with Parliament and also to capitalize the Kabul Bank and fix it. He also
shared some interesting and important insights on Pakistan which I will forward after my meetings in Islamabad. Might
be a good idea for you to log a call with him and just say "how pleased you are that he will move on the Kabul Bank and
end the Special Tribunal" so there's no back sliding! Will summarize Islamabad (and the full dinner) as soon as I can after
the meetings which start tomorrow night.
