Subject: Saudi, Syria fail to reach deal on Lebanon tension (Reuters)

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and Syria failed to reach a deal aimed at curbing political tension in Lebanon
over the 2005 killing of Rafik al-Hariri, Lebanese Christian politician Michel Aoun said. The Saudi and Syrian
initiative "has ended without a result," Aoun told a televised news conference. Saudi Arabia and Syria, powerful
regional players who have traditionally backed rival camps in Lebanon, have worked since July 2010 to forge a
compromise which would curb tensions over the UN-backed tribunal investigating Hariri's killing.
