Subject: N. Korean FM confirms new top envoy to nuclear talks (Yonhap)


BALI (Yonhap) - North Korean Foreign Minister Pak Ui-chun confirmed Friday that Pyongyang has appointed
its new chief negotiator to six-country talks on ending the North's nuclear program, in the first confirmation of a
change in leadership for its nuclear negotiating team.
  Pak confirmed that Ri Yong-ho, the North's vice foreign minister, would be its top envoy to the six-party talks
at a bilateral meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi on the sidelines of the ASEAN Regional
Forum on this Indonesian resort island of Bali.
  For years, North Korea's Kim Kye-gwan served as his country's top negotiator, but he was promoted to the
post of first vice foreign minister last October. Since then, South Korean officials have widely expected Ri to
succeed Kim as top envoy.
  "Vice Foreign Minister Ri is serving as our chief delegate to the six-party talks," said Pak, introducing Ri to
Yang before the two sides began talks at a seaside hotel in Bali.
  The Chinese foreign minister greeted Ri with a nod.
