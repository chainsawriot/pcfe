Subject:                          Good news from Malaysia



Heard from Malaysia yesterday that GoM has approved phase one of the expanded English language program. Paul
Jones met with PM who committed $1 million to expand English Teaching Assistant program from17 to 50 ETAs. Next
step will be to launch a pilot program using US teachers to train Malaysian teachers. No dates on that yet since GoM
needs to identify a forward leaning provincial gov't to commit to pilot.

In NYC today to explore possibility of working with a foundation to provide e-readers to a number of our American
Spaces, particularly in disadvantaged communities. I think this may be a way to take advantage of the mobile phone
revolution and leverage that infrastructure to provide access to current info even in communities which don't have total
internet access.

Will keep you posted.
