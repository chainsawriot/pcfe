TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Sustained anti-aircraft fire was heard in Tripoli on Saturday evening, a Reuters
correspondent in the Libyan capital said.

    What sounded like distant explosions could also be heard, but it was not clear what had caused them, he said.

    The anti-aircraft fire came from the north and north-eastern parts of the city, he said.
