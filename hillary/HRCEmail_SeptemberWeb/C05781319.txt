Cheryl,
He is the interim response from Ambassador Booth (in Addis Ababa) to your question about the status
of commercial farms in Ethiopia and how they are being affected by the drought. While it is not fully
"team cleared" answer, it does address some of the concerns that you asked about in your earlier e-
mail. If you need something more on this, please let me know.
Respectfully,
Richard Roth
HOAWG Coordinator

Subject: RE: S Questions on Differentiated Drought Impacts

Jonathan, I'm just back from a visit to one of the worst drought affected areas of the country — central Somali state, so I
have not had a chance to consult with my team on your question. However, it is my understanding that the few foreign-
owned commercial farms that are operating (extent of foreign owned farms has been exaggerated in the press) in
Ethiopia are in areas that are not drought-affected. They are most likely doing as well as the Ethiopian farms in the
areas they are operating in, mainly in the west (Gambela state). More on this tomorrow.

In the Somali region, the worst hit by drought, the population is predominantly pastoralists, not farmers. The problem is
not so much crop failure as it is the drying up of pasturage, which leads to death of animals, no milk for children and no
meat for anyone and hence severe hunger. They generally sold a few animals for grains, but with emaciated animals
they get less grain in return. One NGO worker I met with today said last year a goat fetched 3 bags of wheat; today it
takes 3 goats to get a bag of wheat. I observed a fundamental problem — pastoralists in the Somali region see animals as
a sign of wealth and thus they try to maximize their herds, which leads to overgrazing even in good years, disaster in dry
years. The pastoralists are also refuse to embrace of family planning. At an irrigation scheme, I observed villagers

cutting their corn before it matures to feed the plant stalks to their animals. Result will be no grain to harvest, animals
that will most likely die anyway and people who will need food aid.

Importance: High

Dear Ambassador Booth and FTF Team in Addis Ababa,

Thank you for your quick input on prioritizing food security policy issues.

Our office is writing now because Secretary Clinton recently raised a few questions on the
situation in Ethiopia.

She asked whether the foreign-owned farms in Ethiopia are doing just as badly as the rest of
the afflicted region and whether there is a difference among impacts based on farming
practices. Among other things, she is curious whether the drought-resistant seeds used in
certain places are holding up while other crops fail, or whether this is such a severe
drought that nothing has worked to stave it off.

We would like to report back by Tuesday if at all possible, so would ask for your response by
your close of business on Tuesday (7/26).

Many thanks,
Jonathan Shrier I Acting Deputy Coordinator for Diplomacy, Feed the Future
