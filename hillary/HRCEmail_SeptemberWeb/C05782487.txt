Subject: Look What's Happening with the QDDR

Per your conversation with Steve, here is the text of the message from the Secretary yesterday:



                                                 THE SECRETARY OF STATE
                                                      WASHINGTON

Dear Colleagues,

I want to share with you our progress on implementing the recommendations of the first Quadrennial Diplomacy and
Development Review (QDDR). Since the report's release, we have been hard at work to implement the vision laid out in
the QDDR for cross-cutting institutional changes, policy shifts, and reorganization. Many bureaus and posts are also
actively fulfilling the goals and objectives of the QDDR in their daily work.

Now we have an intranet website, http://oddr.state.Rov, to share information more widely about our progress and
accomplishments. On this site, you will find descriptions and status updates for QDDR implementation projects. We
also want to hear from you. Whether in Washington, at our offices elsewhere in the United States, or out in the field,
how are you implementing QDDR principles? How are you using connection technologies? How are you adapting,
innovating and finding efficiencies? How are you collaborating on whole of government solutions?

Please submit your stories to QDDRStories@state.gov for publication. And of course, we continue to welcome your
suggestions for improvements and efficiencies on The Sounding Board.

Thank you for all of your hard work —from the team in Washington, to the "workhorses" down in Charleston, to
Passport Agencies and Foreign Mission domestic offices, to all of you overseas. We will all need to work together to
harness our civilian power to both advance America's interests and to help make a world where more people can live in
freedom, prosperity, and peace.

Sincerely,

 Hillary Rodham Clinton
