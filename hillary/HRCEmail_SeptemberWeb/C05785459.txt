Subject: Egypt official says Mubarak's wife feeling better (AP)

SHARM EL-SHEIKH (AP) - A hospital official says Egypt's ex-first lady Suzanne Mubarak is feeling better
following treatment for chest pains she suffered after being told she would be detained by the government for
further questioning on corruption allegations.
   The official says the 70-year-old wife of ousted leader Hosni Mubarak was visited Saturday by a cardiologist
who found "noticeable improvement in her condition."
   He tells The Associated Press that Mrs. Mubarak suffered Friday from angina and high blood pressure. The
hospital official spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not allowed to release the information before
further tests are conducted.
   Mrs. Mubarak is at Sharm el-Sheikh hospital, where her 83-year-old husband also is being treated for a heart
condition.
