Subject: Italy condemns attack on its Tripoli embassy (Reuters)



ROME (Reuters) - Italy on Sunday condemned an attack on its embassy in Tripoli as a "grave and vile" act and
said Muammar Gaddafi's government had failed to carry out its most elementary international obligations.

   The Foreign Ministry issued a statement after the Italian embassy in the Libyan capital was vandalised. A
spokesman said there were no further details but a witness said smoke was rising from the building.
