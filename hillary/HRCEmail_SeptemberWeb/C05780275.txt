 Madam Secretary:

 UNHCR officials in Benghazi met today with Eman Obeidi.




• This and other information is now in the media, with Human Rights Watch, Amnesty
  International and others both condemning the return and urging the TNC to ensure her safe
  departure.

 We will continue to monitor the situation throughout the weekend, and will keep you updated.

 Eric
