Subject: Uzbek Political Prisoner Yusuf Juma Released May 19 (SBU)

(SBU) Embassy Tashkent reports dissident poet Yusuf Juma was released from prison May 19. Jailed in 2008
for his criticism of President Karimov, the Secretary raised his case during her visit to Tashkent in December
2010. Juma is scheduled to depart Tashkent May 20 at approximately 0600 Tashkent (May 19 at 2100 EDT)
for Chicago. Juma is traveling with his daughter and grandson on a humanitarian parole letter. They will be
accompanied by an embassy locally employed staff member to their final destination in Kentucky, where Juma
will join his wife and children. Both his wife and children are legal permanent residents.
