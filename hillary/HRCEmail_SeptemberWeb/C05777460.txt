Subject: House foreign affairs chair: Haiti needs leaders (AP)

MIAMI (AP) - The new chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee says sustainable recovery and
development in Haiti depends on strong leadership. But Republican South Florida Congresswoman Ileana Ros-
Lehtinen says Haiti doesn't have those leaders yet. Her trip to Haiti on January 11 was her first since becoming
chairwoman. She joined former President Bill Clinton on a tour of reconstruction efforts and a Project
Medishare hospital in Haiti's capital. She says she could see a difference in the amount of rubble cleared and
the number of Haitians moving out of tent camps since her last visit six months ago.
