Would be very good to schedule at time when President could address group too. That's model in several other
countries for annual ambassadors' meetings, including France and Russia. Also valuable to do at time when Congress is
in session, allowing for both individual consultations on Hill and coordinated sessions with key Congressional leaders.

Yes, on it. If you can give me the preferred date[s] for the Secretary then I will have Marguerite Coffey [who runs my
management planning shop] get together with the PDAS's and Executive Directors of the regional bureaus plus 10 and
come up with a program

Will likely use a model akin to what usually happens at a regular COM Conference but with a front end on the first day
that is S re QDDR and then one/two days at the end for each bureau to run split-off sessions

Regards

pat

As you know, S is on board w/ a common ambo conference at end of month per our discussion of framing it in qddr
frame, as it will present oppor for leadership training with conscious ceo focus, wiki discussion, camraderie and ideally
cost savings w/ one conf though no doubt each region will have a breakout day (two)?


Can you advise how this will be done, who will have point on such a collaboration, what the common agenda can look
like and when it can be announced? I b/I it may be too much to do by close of jan but wanted to get update on ball
rolling.


Thx
Cdm
