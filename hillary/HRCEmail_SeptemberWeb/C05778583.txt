Subject: UK Hague: some Information Gaddafi on way to Venezuela (Reuters)

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary William Hague said on Monday he had seen some
information to suggest Libyan President Muammar Gaddafi had fled the country and was on his way to
Venezuela.

   "You asked me earlier about whether Colonel Gaddafi is in Venezuela," he told reporters on the sidelines of
a European Union foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels.

    "I have no information that says he is, but I have seen some information that suggests he is on his way there
at the moment."

   Diplomats said Hague was not referring to rumours circulating in the media about Gaddafi's whereabouts,
but to separate sources for the information.
