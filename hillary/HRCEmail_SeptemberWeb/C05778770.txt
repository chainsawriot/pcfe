Subject: UPDATE: UN Libya draft resolution calls for no-fly zone

   UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - A U.N. Security Council draft resolution on a no-fly zone over Libya,
circulated Tuesday, would authorize "all necessary measures to enforce" a ban on all flights, to protect civilians.

   The draft, seen by Reuters, says the council "decides to authorize a ban on all flights in the airspace of
(Libya) in order to help protect civilians."

    It authorizes member states to "take all necsssary measures to enforce compliance."

    After receiving the draft at a council meeting, members adjourned without taking action and were expected
to reconvene Wednesday. Some members of the 15-nation body have expressed doubts about whether a no-fly
zone will work.
