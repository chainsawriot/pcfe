I had a longtime postponed lunch with Betty and David. He was remembering his briefing with you at Blair House before
you were to officially become FL. He said after all the talk about what could be done for kids, he remembers telling you
as he was leaving that you could you make a real contribution on the international stage and he hoped that you would
consider doing so.

He would like to be helpful. He's done a lot of work on preventive diplomacy which he feels is too often overlooked and
extremely essential.
