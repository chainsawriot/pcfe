 Subject: Palestinian protesters slam Obama over UN speech (AP)



  RAMALLAH, West Bank - (AP) Palestinian protesters have denounced President Barack Obama for his
opposition to their bid to win U.N. recognition of a Palestinian state.
  Dozens rallied on Thursday outside Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' office in Ramallah.
  They held up anti-Obama signs, including one reading "Obama the hypocrite" and another claiming the
American president is siding "with killers against victims."
  Obama told the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday that a state can only be established through
negotiations with Israel. The U.S. has said it would block the recognition request in the Security Council.
  Abbas says he prefers negotiations but disagrees with Israel over the starting point for talks.
