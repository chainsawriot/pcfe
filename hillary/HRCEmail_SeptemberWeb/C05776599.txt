Our mission to the OECD wants to announce USG support for Angel Gurria's reappointment at OECD Secretary General.
Bob and Froman both support. Most other countries have already said they support; there are no other candidates; and
the OECD has never not given a SG a second term. Nobody in the USG has raised objections. Just wanted to flag for you
in case you had concerns.
