Subject: ExxonMobil Pulls Out of Ghana Deal




SENSITIVE BUT UNLASSIFIED:




Don: Hold on to your chair. ExxonMobil has just pulled the plug on the Kosmos deal and is walking away from its
attempts to acquire the production rights in the Jubilee field.                                                        B4
                                                                                                                       B6
ExxonMobil's senior management had just informed Kosmos/Blackstone that they were exercising a clause in the
Kosmos-ExxonMobil sales agreement to cancel the deal. Kosmos was stunned by the decision, but thinks ExxonMobil's
position to withdraw is firm and likely irreversible.

Kosmos is preparing a press statement to be issued tomorrow.                   ExxonMobil would probably inform me
of their decision tonight or tomorrow morning. (As soon as we see the press releases, we will forward them to you.) If I
have not heard anything from Exxon by mid morning Tuesday, I will reach out to Sim Moats.                                B4
                                                                                                                       B6




Depending on what happens in the next 24 hours, I may not travel to Connecticut to see President Mills.

Let's talk tomorrow. Johnnie
