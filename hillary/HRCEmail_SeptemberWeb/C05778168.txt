Arabs to reject foreign intervention in Libya

Date: 02 March 2011




CAIRO, March 2, 2011 (AFP) - Arab foreign ministers meeting in Cairo on Wednesday will reject foreign intervention in
Libya, a senior Arab League official said, as the West considered military action.

The Cairo meeting, attended by foreign ministers and representatives of the 22-member body, is to focus on unrest in
Libya where fighting between loyalists of leader Moamer Kadhafi and anti-regime forces has killed about 1,000 people.

"The Arab League council will issue a resolution stressing Arab rejection of any foreign military intervention in Libya,"
said Hesham Youssef, Arab League chief Amr Mussa's chief of staff.

The league would also stress its support for "the unity and security of Libyan territory," Youssef said.

Western powers are discussing the possibility of imposing a no-fly zone over Libya to support forces fighting Kadhafi's
regime. Some opposition figures in Libya have begun calling for air strikes.

Two American warships carrying marines and equipment, the USS Kearsarge and the USS Ponce, entered the Suez Canal
on Wednesday en route to Libya.
