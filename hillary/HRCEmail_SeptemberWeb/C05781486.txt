Subject:                           Three things



1. I'm going to grab you on your way out the door to say hello to my little nephew.

2. The testimony is in good shape. I'll stay in touch with Ben and Dan over the course of the day and night.

3. I will email you a bit later with a short cheatsheet of the toughest questions and toplines. It will be a handy reference
to supplement the QA book, which is in solid shape.

I'll stay on top of other developments to ensure you're fully prepared for tomorrow am.
