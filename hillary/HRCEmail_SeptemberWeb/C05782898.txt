Subject: China currency bill passes U.S. Senate (Reuters)

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Tuesday voted to pass legislation designed to press China to let its
yuan currency rise in value, sending the bill to the House of Representatives, whose leaders have criticized the
measure.

   The Currency Exchange Rate Oversight Reform Act of 2011 allows the U.S. government to slap
countervailing duties on products from countries found to be subsidizing their exports by undervaluing their
currencies.
