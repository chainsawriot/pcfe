The Condi Rice piece on START appears in the Wall Street Journal today. Will send you full piece, but in short,
it says Senators should ratify but seek assurances on missile defense.

On the tax deal, we have to be push back on the notion that this was the price we had to pay to get
START. Not sure how successful we will be at keeping them separate, but just want to keep any Dem revolt (if
there is one) focused on the tax deal and not on New START...
