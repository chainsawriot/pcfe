H: Steve Clemons called me last night to talk about this, which he's just posted on his website. Ed Luce of the FT of
course told him. Also, Clemons had dinner this week with Petraeus, who freely talked about running for president. Sid




John Podesta on Obama team. I am hearing that Financial Times Washington Bureau Chief Edward Luce
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Luce> has a pretty significant interview with Center for American Progress
President and former White House Chief of Staff John Podesta
<http://www.americanprogress.org/experts/PodestaJohn.html> coming out on Monday. Luce recently did a video
interview with Senator John McCain <http://www.ft.com/cms/1644d0824450-11dc-aaad-
0000779fd2ac.html? j_referralObject=14346013&fromSearch=n> . One source tells me that Podesta "goes farther" in
his critique of the Obama team than his already pretty direct comments in Luce's recent survey
<http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b6b4700a-10fb-11df-9a9e-00144feab49a.html?nclick_check=1> of the Obama White
House's inner workings.
