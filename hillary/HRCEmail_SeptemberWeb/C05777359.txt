Subject: Bhutto pledges to defend minorities in Pakistan (Reuters)

LONDON (Reuters) - Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, chairman of Pakistan's ruling party, condemned the killing of a
politician for seeking changes to blasphemy laws, and called those celebrating his death "the real blasphemers".
Bhutto, the son of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto who was assassinated in 2007, also pledged to defend
the country's minorities - increasingly under siege from powerful religious lobbies and often targets of Islamist
violence.
