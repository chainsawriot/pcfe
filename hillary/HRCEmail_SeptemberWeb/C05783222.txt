Subject: France wants Mideast talks in 1 month (AP)


UNITED NATIONS (AP) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy is proposing a timetable for Israeli-Palestinian
peace with resumed talks in one month, agreement on borders and security in six months and a final deal in one
year.
  Fulfilling his promise to try to sidetrack the Palestinian bid for U.N. membership, Sarkozy told the General
Assembly Wednesday that after 60 years of failure its time to change tactics.
  He said efforts to reach an accord must include a broader range of players, including Arab nations who have
been sidelined.
  Sarkozy said talks were "doomed to failure" if either side sets preconditions.
