Cheryl told me she would be seeing you again this week. I will be in Europe so I'll miss you but am looking forward to
catching up.

Terrific to see you and Cheryl. I am inspired to begin.

David opted out of the Shadow Cabinet wisely and is doing well. Tony called him - and put Bill on the line for which
David was delighted.

I am back in DC October 13-14 if that is a good time to talk again - otherwise, I am happy to come out any time. I have
let Cheryl know.

Yours,

Lois
