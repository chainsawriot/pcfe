Subject: ElBaradel calls Mubarak move a trick to retain power (Reuters)

WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - Long-time Egyptian diplomat Mohamed ElBaradei does not believe President
Hosni Mubarak went far enough to meet the demands of protesters on Tuesday, calling his moves "a trick" to
try to remain in power, CNN reported.

   CNN, which interviewed ElBaradei but did not immediately air his comments, said the former head of the
U.N. arms control agency indicated he would consider running for president in Egyptian elections in September
but added that was not currently his main focus.

  CNN said ElBaradei told an interviewer he preferred that Mubarak step down immediately and hand over
power to a caretaker government until elections can be held.
