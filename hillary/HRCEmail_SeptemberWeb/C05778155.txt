Subject: Erdogan vows to quit party post if he loses vote (Reuters)


ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan pledged on Sunday to step down as chairman
of the AK Party to prove he is not a "dictator" if it finishes second in a June general election.

  Most opinion polls have shown that AK, which first came to power in 2002, is well ahead of its rivals in a
campaign to win its third term. See.

   "If my party finishes second, I will leave my post as chairman. I will take to the road in Anatolia and join my
people and work from there," Erdogan said in a speech broadcast live by the news channel NTV.

   "Will those who accuse me of having dictatorial aspirations step aside if their party finishes second?" he
said.
