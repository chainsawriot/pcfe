Subject: North Korea to free detained US citizen (AP)

SEOUL, South Korea - (AP) North Korea says it's freeing an American who has been detained since
November.
  The North's official Korean Central News Agency said Friday that Eddie Jun will be freed now that U.S.
envoy for North Korean human rights Robert King has expressed regret. King is visiting the North this week.
  The North says Jun was arrested in November and accused of committing a serious crime against North
Korea. Pyongyang hasn't provided details about the alleged crime. South Korean media have reported Jun was
accused of proselytizing.
  The North says former U.S. President Jimmy Carter also asked the North to pardon Jun during a recent visit.
  North Korea says that it decided to free Jun for humanitarian reasons.
