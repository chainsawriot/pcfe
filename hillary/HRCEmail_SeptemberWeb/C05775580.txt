Looping in Jake and Huma. This is good. But there is still plenty of scope for maneuvering on Honduras.

Both requests for new agenda items have been officially defeated.

(However, it is always possible for a Honduras res to be advanced in General Committee under an existing GA agenda
item once dels realize this is a possibility. Although all new resolutions are supposed to be in by 9:30, this rule is not
always respected)

Request for this resolution has been defeated as Ecuador did not receive the required 2/3 votes for a new agenda item
on the topic.

Procedural discussion now focused on Nica's request for a new formal agenda item (which would inevitably lead to a
resolution) on Honduras.

Amb LomeIlin has just learned that ALBAS - led by Ecuador - are advancing a GA resolution on Gaza. The Israeli observer
also approached us with concern. We are trying to get a copy of the draft now.
