WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. forces in Japan are not allowed within 50 miles of Japan's crippled nuclear
power plant, the Pentagon Wednesday, explaining measures meant to keep U.S. troops safe during a relief
operation.

   The U.S. military is also giving some flight crews potassium iodide tablets ahead of missions as a way to
guard against effects of radiation, officials said.

   The measures were seen as precautions and the Pentagon said no U.S. forces have shown signs of radiation
poisoning.
