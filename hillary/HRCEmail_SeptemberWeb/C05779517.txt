B/c sending more arms into a society generally — particularly when they are as disorganized and fragmented as they are
— will result in more violence — against each other. Boys like to play with guns (trust me as the mother of sons). I am all
for saying we have no objection to French doing it to increase pressure on Gaddafi, but in a tribal society where conflicts
have been repressed for so long, adding even more weapons does not make sense. Obviously they can get weapons .
from other places, but nb that they are not awash in weapons now. I wrote something for New York Review of Books
this week that builds on my farewell remarks and I think you will like it; will send it to you for weekend reading.

One for the wall...

For what Ws worth, I am VERY dubious about arming the Libyan rebels. Our best bet is to keep pressure on BOTH sides
to force a diplo solution. AMS
