Subject: Captured Israeli likely home Tuesday, family says (AP)

   JERUSALEM - (AP) A spokeswoman for the family of captured Israeli soldier Gilad Schalit says he will
likely be returned on Tuesday.
   Tarni Shienlunan said Friday that the Israeli military chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Benny Gantz, told the Schalit
family the news.
   It is the highest-level indication so far of the date for the first phase of a deal between Schalit's captors,
Hamas, and Israel.
   The Islamic militant group will free Schalit in exchange for over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. Some 450 are
set to be released in the deal's first phase.
   Shienlcman says the military chief emphasized that unexpected events could delay the deal. She says Gantz
spoke to the family in their home in northern Israel on Thursday evening.
