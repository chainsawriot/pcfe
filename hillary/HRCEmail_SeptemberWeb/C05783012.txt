Subject: Liberia election body says poll credible (Reuters)



MONROVIA (Reuters) -     The head of Liberia's election commission has rejected opposition allegations of fraud
in the West African country's election, saying the vote was credible.

   Nine Liberian opposition parties, including President Ellen Johnson-Sirleafs two main challengers, on
Saturday rejected results announced so far for this week's presidential election and said party members would
withdraw from the rest of the counting process.

   "It doesn't pose any credibility problems," National Election Commission Chairman James Fromayah told
journalists. "All the parties participated in the elections. The counting was done and both the local population
and the international observers that came acclaimed the process to be free, fair and transparent."
