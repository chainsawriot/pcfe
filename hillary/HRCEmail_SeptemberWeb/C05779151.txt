    Cheryl I am in DC so don't have any new updates. All of the key S Africans are in Addis. Johnnie was supposed to be meeting with
    them to discuss Aristide. I have not gotten an update from those meetings.

President Preval advised the private sector this am that he has dispatched an indiv w/ a diplomatic passport for Aristide to S. A.

Reueters is reporting a siting of him today w/ his wife in Cuba.

So at the risk of asking for an update - I must ask.

I would appreciate any update you can give me.

Thank you so much
