Hi Jake,

In several ways,




The example of Kim Dae Jung in Korea is a good one: as a candidate for pres he bitterly opposed the IMF program. But
then supported in the national interest -- which not only saved the economy from bankruptcy but lead to its dramatic
revival. And he came across as a hero for putting the national interest above party interests and for the ultimate success
of the policy. I was financial advisor to Korea at the time -- and the national unity this produced had a profound impact
on markets and respect for korea around the world.

See you soon,
Bob
