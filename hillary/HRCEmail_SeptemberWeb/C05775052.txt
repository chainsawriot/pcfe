Subject: The sensitive personnel matter

Purely to update: Tom had me in for lunch at the Mess this past week, ostensibly to discuss my upcoming trip to
Georgia, Ukraine, Russia, but in fact to discuss the Our Mutual Friend. It sounded quite ominous re his immediate boss,
and not great re the ultimate one. I know OMF had a meeting w/ Tom's immediate boss later, but I do not know what
transpired. I'm having dinner w/ OMF tomorrow/Sunday.           remain in the same mode as the one you asked me to be in
some weeks ago, unless you tell me otherwise.
   No need to reply in substance to this message-it's just informational; but I'd appreciate confirmation of receipt.
  On a more cheerful note, the Times piece turned out very, very well.
   Hope my Russian friends were there usual charming and helpful selves. Javier Solana and I will be there. in a little over
a week.
  Hi to Bill.
  S.

Subject: The matter I raised on my end of the converation last night

Just reached Tom about it. Alerted him to the version as it came to me, including potential of its breaking. He seemed
a) aware of the basis for what I'd heard, b) to share my assessment/concern (though asked me to elaborate, which I did
vividly), and c) prepared to make sure that whatever ready to be is said publicly - and whatever happens diplomatically -
put the kibosh on the version as it came to me.
   Incidentally, unbidden by me on both points-i.e., volunteering-he went out of his way to says upbeat things about you
and downbeat things about OMF. Said he wanted to discuss that with me in person. I said nothing of substance, except
always glad to talk.
   Over and out, tho would appreciate you're confirming receipt, since I'm not cc'ing anyone on this.
   Cha-cha-cha (even though you're not going to Argentina-and rightly so).
