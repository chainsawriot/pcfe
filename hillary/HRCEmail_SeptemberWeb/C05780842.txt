Subject: Gaddafi aide wounded in Tripoli rocket attack-rebel (Reuters)

ROME, July 22 (Reuters) - A Libyan rebel official said on Friday that a member of Muammar Gaddafi's inner
circle had been seriously wounded by a rocket attack on a room in Tripoli where senior Libyan officials were
meeting.

   Ali Essawi, in charge of foreign affairs for the rebels fighting Gaddafi, said one of the Libyan leader's sons,
Saif al-Islam, Prime Minister al-Baghdadi Ali Al-Mahmoudi, intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi and an
official named Mansour Daw were in the room at the time of the attack on Thursday.

    Daw is a former bodyguard of Gaddafi who is a close aide.

  "Yesterday there was a very strong signal in Tripoli -- that there was an attack (on) an operations room
where there were senior and high, top-level officials including Saif al-Islam, al-Baghdadi Mahmoudi, Abdullah
Senussi and Mansour, who (was) severely injured," Essawi told a news conference in Rome.

    "We confirm this."

   He did not say how he knew of the attack in the Gaddafi-held Libyan capital or who was behind it. Officials
of Gaddafi's government were not immediately available for comment.

    Italy's Foreign Minister Franco Frattini, who held talks with Essawi before they addressed reporters together,
later said it was not clear which official had been seriously wounded, but that it was "probably" Daw.
