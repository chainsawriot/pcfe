Subject: UPDATE: DeLay Sentenced to 3 Years in Money Laundering Case (NYT)

AUSTIN (NYT) - Mr. DeLay was taken by sheriffs deputies to the county jail, where he was expected to post a
$10,000 bond and be released pending an appeal. After listening to Mr. DeLay say he felt he had done nothing
wrong, Judge Pat Priest sentenced him to three years in prison for conspiracy and 10 years' probation for the
money laundering count. The judge rejected arguments from Mr. DeLay that the trial had been a politically
motivated vendetta mounted by an overzealous Democratic District Attorney.
