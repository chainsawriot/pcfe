Subject: Switzerland brings Iran sanctions in line with EU (Reuters)

ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland is tightening sanctions against Iran to bring them in line with those of its own
trading partners, the Swiss government said on January 19. The new measures, which will come into
force January 20, should prevent Switzerland from being used as a way for Iran to get goods that it would
otherwise not be able to get from other countries, the government said in a statement.
