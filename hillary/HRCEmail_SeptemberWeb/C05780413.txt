Subject: Australia says recognizes Libya rebel council (Reuters)


ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Australia has recognized Libya's rebel Transitional National Council as the country's
legitimate political representative, Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd said June 9. "We do not recognize
governments, we recognize states," he told reporters at a summit aimed at backing the Benghazi-based rebels
against Qadhafi's rule. He called the council "the legitimate interlocutor of the Libyan people, and we use that
formulation deliberately."
