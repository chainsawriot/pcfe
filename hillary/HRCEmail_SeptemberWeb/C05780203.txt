Subject: UN: 34 killed in Iraqi army raid on Iranian exiles (AP)

BAGHDAD - (AP) A U.N. spokesman says 34 people were killed in an Iraqi army raid last week on a camp
of Iranian exiles and the bodies of 28 are still at Camp Ashraf.
   The statement Thursday by U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville in Geneva is the first independent
confirmation of how deadly the pre-dawn riot last Friday was.
   Colville said most of the dead at the camp in Iraq's eastern Diyala province appeared to have been shot.
   He said six bodies have still not been found.
   The raid targeted the People's Mujahedeen Organization of Iran, which seeks to overthrow Iran's clerical
leaders.
