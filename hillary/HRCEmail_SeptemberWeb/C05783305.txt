Hi Jake,
Since S is very interested in this, I wanted to keep you up to date.
Had good meeting with Finance Min yesterday. Will send you more details.

Also working with chamber of commerce -- to be sure he meets US businesses, which he did (50 or so).

And we are planning a meeting which i will co host with a larger group for the PM in early october. Also have brought in
USTR to advance trade agenda -- and they have a team going out next week.
Will see FinMin again in the coming week to follow up.

Egypt, Libya --- and Greece this afternoon. Will report.
Regards,
Bob
