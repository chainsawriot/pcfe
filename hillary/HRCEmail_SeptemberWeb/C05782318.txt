Hello! I hope this finds you doing well.


I'm writing you to let you know that today is my last day in the Office of the Chief of Protocol as I head to Chicago to give
learning a try at DePaul University's School of Public Service. It has been an absolute honor and privilege to work
alongside you all during this Administration. I am pretty confident I am one of the luckiest people around and as I leave,
I remain in awe of the experiences I have had here in Washington and worldwide. Thank you for being part of those
experiences.


Please do not be a stranger and if you find yourself in Chicago, come say hello!


Best,


Connolly
