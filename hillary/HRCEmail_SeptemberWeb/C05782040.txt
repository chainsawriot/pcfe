Subject: Libya rebels claim victory in key oil terminal (AP)


BENGHAZI (AP) - A Libyan rebel spokesman says rebel fighters have captured the key oil terminal of Brega
from Moammar Gadhafi's troops after three weeks of fighting.
   Mohammed al-Rijali says "Brega is liberated."
   He says he was with the fighters when they took control of the strategic port earlier on Thursday. He spoke to
The Associated Press over the telephone from nearby Ajdabiya.
   The rebel claim could not be immediately verified.
   Brega fell under rebel control briefly in March, but was recaptured by Gadhafi's forces shortly afterward.
   Whoever controls the strategic oil terminal, which is also Libya's second-largest hydrocarbon complex, is in
charge of the country's main oil fields.
