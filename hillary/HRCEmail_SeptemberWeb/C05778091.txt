TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia's interim government has granted the main Islamist group, Ennahda, permission to
form a political party, the official TAP news agency said on Tuesday. The move will allow Ennahda, a
moderate Islamist movement that had been banned for two decades under toppled President Zine al-Abidine
Ben Al's rule, to participate in upcoming elections.
