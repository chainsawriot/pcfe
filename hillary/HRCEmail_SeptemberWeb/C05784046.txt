At the A/5 meeting Monday, HRC raised her recent conversation with Patricia Espinosa, who expressed a good deal of
concern about the climate process this year —South Africans are in charge — especially as it concerns the Mexicans' own
signature issue, the so-called "Green Fund." I gave her a short update on the spot and then also sent up a note (at Alice
Wells' request) a couple days later.

HRC may be interested to know that I will be representing the Department at the U.S.-Mexico Bilateral Framework on
Clean Energy and Climate Change May 18 in Mexico City, and that while there I will be meeting privately with Espinosa.
