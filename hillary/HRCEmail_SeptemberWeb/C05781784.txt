Subject: Blasts rock Libyan capital near Gadhafi compound (AP)


TRIPOLI (AP) - Early morning explosions have rocked Libya's capital, striking near Moarnmar Gadhafi's main
compound of Bab al-Aziziyah.
   Seven thunderous blasts on Friday could be felt at a hotel where foreign journalists stay in Tripoli.
  As Associated Press correspondent watched flames from the bombs fall from the sky as NATO jets circled
the air over the compound.
   Residents also told the AP that three strikes were heard hitting the road to the airport in the capital.
   It wasn't immediately clear what was hit or if there were civilian casualties.
  NATO has been bombarding military targets in Libya since a no-fly zone was instituted in March.
   Rebel fighters are also closing in on the capital from the west and the south.
