HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finnish Social Democrat leader Jutta Urpilainen said on Saturday the party had named
herself as finance minister in the new coalition government, and Erklci Tuomioja would become foreign
minister.

    The new government is expected to be appointed next week, about two months after April elections.

   New six party coalition, lead by prime minister-elect Jyrki Katainen of right-leaning National Coalition
party, launched its borrowing and spending curbing programme late on Friday. The Social Democrats are
traditionally pro-European Union, but Urpilainen repeated on Friday that Finland will demand guarantees
against participation in any new bailouts for debt-laden euro area countries.
