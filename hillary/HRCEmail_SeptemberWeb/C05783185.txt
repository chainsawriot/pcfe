SANAA, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Heavy shelling and machinegtm fire rocked Yemen's capital Sanaa on Tuesday, on
the third day of violence triggered by the deadliest crackdown yet on pro-democracy protesters, witnesses
said.

   Shots rang out in the early hours of the morning, residents told Reuters, despite reports of a ceasefire
between troops loyal to President Ali Abdullah Saleh and soldiers who had defected to the opposition.
