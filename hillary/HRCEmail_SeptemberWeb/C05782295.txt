UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States and South Africa struck a deal Thursday to allow the release
of $1.5 billion in frozen Libya funds for humanitarian aid and other civilian needs, U.N. diplomats said
Thursday.

   Council diplomats said the agreement would enable the funds tp be released without a U.N. Security Council
vote on a U.S. draft resolution that Washington submitted to the council Wednesday in response to South Africa
blocking a U.S. request to disburse the money in the U.N. Libya sanctions committee.
