Subject: Muhammad Yunus brings 'social business' to Haiti (AP)

PORT-AU-PRINCE (AP) - Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus is introducing a concept called "social
business" to Haiti as it tries to rebuild after last year's earthquake.
   The economist says he wants Haiti to have businesses that solve problems.
   The Bangladesh native is a celebrity of sorts in development circles. He pioneered the idea of making
"micro" loans to some of the world's poorest people as a spur to economies and anti-poverty efforts.
   Yunus began a two-day visit to Haiti on Thursday. He recently joined an economic advisory board for Haiti
along with former U.S. President Bill Clinton and others.
