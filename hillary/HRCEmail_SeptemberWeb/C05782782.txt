Subject: UPDATE: Palestinian spokesman agrees to talks only under settlement freeze (Reuters)


BRUSSELS, Oct 9 (Reuters) - In response to Ashton's statement, Nabil Abu Rdainah, a spokesman for Abbas,
said that if Israel "recognises the 1967 borders and freezes settlements, we are ready to go immediately" to talks
the EU seeks to convene.

   In Jerusalem, an Israeli official contacted by Reuters would not comment on the planned invitation, but
suggested Israel would be ready to attend if no conditions were attached.

   Israel has "repeatedly expressed its willingness to start direct peace talks with the Palestinians face to face
without any preconditions whatsoever," the official said. He added: "We hope the Palestinians will be ready,
too."
