Subject: UK's Hague hopeful on more combat planes for Libya (Reuters)

BERLIN, April 14 (Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary William Hague said on Thursday he was hopeful other .
NATO members would provide more ground attack planes for the Libya operation, even though some have
rebuffed calls to do more.

   "I'm hopeful ... There are certainly quite a few countries that don't rule out doing so and that may well give
consideration to it (providing more ground attack aircraft) ... It does need us to follow it up," Hague told Reuters
on the sidelines of a NATO foreign ministers' meeting in Berlin.

   Asked if U.S. forces could resume ground strikes, Hague said: "The United States is making a huge
contibution ... It's not unreasonable to ask other nations ... to make additional contributions," he said.

   Asked about reports of NATO strikes on the Libyan capital Tripoli on Thursday, Hague said: "There will
continue to be strikes against regime forces that may threaten civilians wherever they are in Libya. Those can
happen in any place at any time where there are Gaddafi forces operating."
