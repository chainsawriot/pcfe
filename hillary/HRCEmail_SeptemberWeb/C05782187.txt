Gore urges Obama to block pipeline for 'dirtiest source of fuel on the
planet'

Former Vice President Al Gore called on President Obama late Wednesday to reject a pending permit application for
a controversial pipeline project, calling the oil that it would carry "the dirtiest fuel on the planet."

"The answer to our climate, energy and economic challenges does not lie in burning more dirty fossil fuels â€”
instead, we must continue to press for much more rapid development of renewable energy and energy efficient
technologies and cuts in the pollution that causes global warming," Gore, a vocal climate activist, wrote on his Wog
Wednesday night.

The State Department is just months away from a decision on the proposed TransCanada's Keystone XL
pipeline, which would carry Canadian oil sands from Alberta to refineries on the Texas Gulf coast.
Environmental groups and others have mounted an aggressive opposition campaign to the 1,700-mile proposed
pipeline. They've staged a two-week protest in front of the White House that has led to hundreds of arrests and
put President Obama on notice that a failure to block the project could hurt his reelection campaign.

Gore blasted the project Wednesday, raising concerns about the environmental impact of Canada's oil sands
production, which results in higher greenhouse gas emissions than conventional oil production.

"The tar sands are the dirtiest source of fuel on the planet," Gore said.

Many Republicans and the oil industry have pressed the administration to approve the project, arguing it will
boost the economy. But Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman, a Republican, called on Obama to reject the proposed
pipeline Thursday.

A final environmental review released by the State Department last week said there would be "no significant impacts
to most resources" along the route if the company adheres to conditions and mitigation measures that pipeline
regulators and environmental agencies demand.

Critics of the pipeline blasted the review, arguing it ignores key concerns about the project.

But Energy Secretary Steven Chu hinted this week that he supports the project, arguing in an interview that the
country would be better off getting oil from Canada than unstable nations in the Middle East.

The State Department says it hopes to make a final decision on the project by the end of the year.
