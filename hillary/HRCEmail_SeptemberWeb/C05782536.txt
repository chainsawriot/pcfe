Subject: Iran warns Turkey about NATO's defense system (AP)


TEHRAN (AP) - Iran is warning Turkey against hosting NATO's missile defense system, saying such a move
would escalate regional tensions.
   Foreign ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast says Iran expects its neighbors not to pave way for
policies that lead to "complicated consequences."
   Mehmanparast says Iran believes that having the missile defense system in Turkey would not serve regional
stability. His remarks were reported by the official IRNA news agency on Thursday.
   Turkey has recently agreed to host an early warning radar as part of NATO's missile defense system aimed at
countering ballistic missile threats from neighboring Iran.
   Washington hopes to have the radar deployed in Turkey by the end of the year.
