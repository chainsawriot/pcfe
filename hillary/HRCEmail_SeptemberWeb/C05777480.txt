Subject: Hezbollah and allies to topple Lebanon government (Reuters)

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Ministers from Lebanon's Hezbollah movement and its political allies will resign January
12, forcing the collapse of Prime Minister Hariri's government, a senior political source said. "The resignation
statement has been written and will be announced at 4:30pm (0930 EDT)." he said. Eleven ministers would
resign, enough to automatically bring the government down.
