Subject: 2 Americans released from Iranian prison head home (AP)

MUSCAT (AP) - Two Americans released from an Iranian prison have told reporters they are "eager to go
home" just before their flight to the U.S.
  Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer made brief statements Saturday night before boarding a plane in the capital of
Oman, the Gulf sultanate that helped mediate their release on Wednesday.
  The Americans were held for more than two years on accusations they were spying for the United States.
  The plane was due to take off shortly after their statements, but reporters were denied access to the airport
runway to see the plane take off.
  A spokeswoman for their families said they are scheduled to arrive in the U.S. on Sunday afternoon.
  The men were released prison under a $1 million bail deal.
