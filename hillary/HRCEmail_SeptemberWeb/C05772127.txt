Said it's our understanding that the exercise won't begin before Sunday evening NY time.                               1.4(D)

Kislyak said that was helpful and he would convey. Bill said                    Kislyak will get the word back.        B1

obliged as President of Council to grant this request. Timing tbd. Likely 2 or 3pm. Open session. They aim to ask SG to
send an envoy (likely USG Lynn Pascoe) to 6PT countries and DPRK to try to ease tensions.
