Subject: Myanmar foreign minister to visit Japan (Reuters)


TOKYO, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Myarunar's foreign minister will visit Japan next week in another sign that one of
the world's most isolated states is beginning to open up after it freed hundreds of political prisoners this week.

   Wunna Maung Lwin will visit Japan on Oct. 20-22, Kyodo news agency reported on Friday, citing Japanese
Foreign Minister Koichiro Gemba.

    Myanmar's army, which has ruled the former British colony for half a century, formally handed over power
in March to a civilian president, a retired general, who has begun reforms aimed at reviving an economy
crippled by sanctions over human rights abuses.

   Myanmar, also known as Burma, released about 200 political detainees on Wednesday following some
loosening of media controls and more dialogue with pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

   Japan froze new development assistance to Myanmar in 2003, while continuing humanitarian aid. It restored
development help in June and the Foreign Ministry has said it may make further moves if political prisoners are
released.

   Japan is interested in developing Myamnar's rich natural resources, including rare earths, as well as taking
part in fixing the nation's poor infrastructure, Kyodo said, quoting government sources.

    Japan's biggest business lobby, the Keidanren, sent a 20-member delegation to Myanmar in September, the
first such mission to the country in eight years.
