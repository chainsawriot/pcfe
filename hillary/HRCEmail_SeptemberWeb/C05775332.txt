Hi, Cheryl —




Thank you so much for your excellent introduction of the Secretary today, and for your support of the good work of
GLIFFA. As always, the Secretary was brilliant and inspiring. Would it be possible for you to pass on a word to her on my
behalf?




You may remember that I arr                                            working in the Office of Children's Issues,
particularly on international child abduction. You and I were in contact in March 2009, and we discussed then the
possibility of talking with the Secretary about the work we do here in our office. That did not work out, and I of course
understood, but I would like to thank her for her interest in and support of our work, both in abduction and inter-
country adoption.




On a personal note I wanted the Secretary to know




                                  But I want to let the Secretary know that I am especially grateful for all the work she
has done for the GLBT community in the Department and around the world. What a thrill it was to today to hear her say
that gay rights are human rights!




We are indeed at an exciting point in history. Please extend my thanks to the Secretary for her leadership.




All the best,

Kathy

This is very important to her — she raised it before so if you are the primary office, it may make sense to have you and
Director connect with her — politically work?

Hi, Cheryl —

The Office of Children's Issues is in the Bureau of Consular Affairs, Overseas Citizens' Services, and we are the only office
that handles child abductions in the Department. Our office is in SA-29 at 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Fourth floor.
We are the U.S. Central Authority for two Hague Conventions, the Child Abduction Convention and the Intercountry
Adoption Convention. Our office is currently handling more than 1600 open international child abduction cases from
the U.S. and about 400 cases of abductions of children into the U.S. under the Hague Convention. We're very busy!
Come see us!

Kathy
