I know how you like feedback -- i was reading through the cfr speech -- well written and I liked the "new American
moment" idea and the focus on American leadership -- both set you and the administration .up as at the center of all
global foreign policy and national security leadership. But it was short on an action plan in terms of how america could
capitalize on the moment and close the deal on many of the areas sited that were all "in progress". And could have used
a prescription for america and Americans moving forward with what we need to do in this moment while domestic
problems usually cause a pull back from international commitments and interest.

The news of the day really came from the question period when you hit the deficit, Mexican cartels and crazy Florida
minister. (though admin took the bait on this, elevating him). Debt answer calling it a national security threat was
actually the most interesting answer, tying deficit to how it could weaken america.

In any event good speech and some nice rhetoric.
