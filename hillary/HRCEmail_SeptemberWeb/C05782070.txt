Subject: Lebanon: Hlzballah member named in Hariri case (AP)

BEIRUT (AP) - A Lebanese official says at least one Hizballah member is among those indicted in the 2005
assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
  The official saw the arrest warrants that were issued Thursday and gave the names to The Associated Press.
He spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
  One of the people named is Mustafa Badr-Eddine, believed to have been Hizballah's deputy military
commander. He is the brother-in-law of the late Hizballah military commander Imad Mughniyeh.
