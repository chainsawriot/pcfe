First, I wish the happiest and healthiest of new years to you and your family and I'm looking forward to the work ahead
in 2010. Thank you for all you've done this past year.

Do you remember when I was waiting to testify w Gates before the SFRC and I I was talking to
                                          Did I ask you to see if you could get sympathy letters from the POTUS and VP
? I made a note but can't remember whom I asked and wanted to be sure we had followed up. Pls let me know. Thx.
