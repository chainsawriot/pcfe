They refused to leave ops a number to call back (I), so ops is currently waiting for his staff to check back in. If they get
him in the next 10 minutes, they will connect directly to you. Otherwise ill let you know when they hear back from him
again.

I can do in 10 minutes. Will that work?

Ops just called me to say that they have his staff on the line. They are attempting to get his call windows for the day, but
his staff is repeatedly suggesting only "now." If you'd like me to set up this call now or anytime soon, I'll do that.
Otherwise, ops is still trying to negotiate possibilities for later windows.
