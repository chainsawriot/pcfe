Hi Hillary,




Just wanted to let you know that the ARC did give a $10 million grant (reduced to $3.8 because of political reasons) - but
it almost didn't get accepted by the Haitians because they didn't want oversight. But with Paul Farmer's help we
created a joint oversight process with PIH, KPMG and the Ministry of Health. Sadly its slow going. But my cousin at the
ARC is working to do the right things.... Any good words you can say about the ARC would be appreciated!

And we are trying to move things forward still...




As always, fondly,

Mark
