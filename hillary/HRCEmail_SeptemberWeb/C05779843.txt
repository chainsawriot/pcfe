> Hi Jake - below is a very quick note of    latest call between Tony
> Blair and Gaddafi. Mr Blair wanted me to let you know that he is
> making these calls very privately and is not briefing the media.

> Short note of call between Tony Blair and Gaddafi 25 Feb 2011 4pm,
> detailed note to follow.


> Tony Blair delivered a very strong message to Gaddafi that the
> violence had to end and that he had to stand aside to allow a peaceful
> process to take place. He repeated this several times throughout the
> call. Gaddafi insisted that there is no violence on the streets and that AO is leading this unrest.
> Gaddafi believes this is an attempt to re-colonise Libya. Tony Blair
> assured him it was not. He repeated that that the violence had to
>   stop now and that he must leave the country. Gaddafi asked Tony Blair
>   several times to come to Libya to see for himself that there is no
>   violence. Tony Blair said he didn't know if he could do that but
>   again repeated that the important thing was for the violence to stop.
> Tony Blair concluded that he had tried to relay the message and hoped the leader would reflect on it.
> People would like to offer a way out that is peaceful.


> "The absolute key thing is that the bloodshed and violence must stop....


> "if you have a safe place to go then you should go there, because
> this will not end peacefully unless that happens and there has to be
> a process of change. That process of change can be managed and we
> have to find a way of managing it."


> "I have talked to people and everyone wants a peaceful end to this."


> "You've got to try to do something to allow this process to happen
> peacefully. The only way of doing that is say to people that you are

> going to engage in a process of change, that you are telling your
> forces not to use violence against people and that this will now be
> managed peacefully and properly, you need to be in a position where
> Libya is prepared to do this peacefully. The US and the EU are in a
> tough position right now and I need to take something back to them which ensures this ends peacefully."

> "If people saw the leader standing aside they Would be content with
> that. if this goes on for another day/two days we will go past the
> point. I'm saying this because I believe it deeply. If we can't get a
> way through/out very quickly this will go past the point of no return."
