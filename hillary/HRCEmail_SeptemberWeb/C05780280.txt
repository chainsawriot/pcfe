Subject: Security forces fire tear gas on Syrian protesters (AP)


BEIRUT (AP) - Eyewitnesses say Syrian security forces have fired tear gas at thousands of protesters who were
marching toward the Syrian capital.
  The eyewitnesses says tens of thousands of protesters were marching peacefully from the suburb of Douma
when security forces tried to stop them by beating them and firing tear gas.
   Crowds gathered in several Syrian cities on Friday, chanting "Freedom!" and demanding far greater reforms
than the limited concessions offered by President Bashar Assad over the past four weeks.
