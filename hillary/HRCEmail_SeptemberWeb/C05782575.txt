Subject: Libya fighters: We're battling in pro-Gadhafi town (AP)


WISHTATA (AP) - Libyan fighters say they are clashing with Moammar Gadhafi's supporters inside the town
of Bani Walid, one of the last towns holding out against the country's new rulers.
   Abdullah Kenshil, the former rebels' chief negotiatior, says the former rebels are fighting gunmen positioned
in houses in the town.
   "They are inside the city. They are fighting with snipers," he said. Anti-Gadhafi forces were moving in from
the east and south, and were fighting about a mile from the center of the town.
   Kenshil said the attack was provoked by Gadhafi forces firing rockets from inside Bani Walid at former rebel
forces who had taken up positions around the town. He said three Gadhafi loyalists had been wounded and three
killed, while the former rebels had one dead and four wounded.
