FYI, all polls we have witnessed are closed and counting is taking place. We have counts from
scattered voting centers in Cayes, Jacmel, Gonaives and Cap Haitien. Martelly is winning
significantly - about 3 to 1. It's meaning in the grand scheme of things, but still it's interesting that
Martelly is getting support from all areas we have monitors. Canadians are reporting similar figures.
