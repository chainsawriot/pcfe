Subject: Kerry: Darfur integral to better US-Sudan ties (AP)

KHARTOUM (AP) - U.S.        Sen. John Kerry says Khartoum will win quick U.S. incentives if an independence
referendum in the south goes smoothly, but further improvement of ties depends on progress toward peace in
the separate conflict in Darfur. Kerry, Senate Foreign Relations Committee chair, told reporters January 7 that
resolving the war in the western Darfur region remains an important "matrix" in a U.S. incentives package to
the Khartoum government. The first incentives are tied to the southern referendum which begins January 9.
