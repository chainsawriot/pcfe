TRIPOLI (Reuters) - A gun battle broke out in the Libyan capital Tripoli on Friday between 20 to 50 armed
supporters of deposed leader Muammar Gaddafi and forces of the National Transitional Council (NTC), a
Reuters witness and residents said.

   NTC fighters mounted on pick-up trucks raced towards the scene in the Abu Salim neighbourhood, a centre
of support for Gaddafi. The two sides exchanged automatic and heavy machinegun fire, the Reuters witness
said.

  Local residents said the group of armed men had appeared in Abu Salim earlier and had begun chanting pro-
Gaddafi slogans.
