Subject: Two N. Irish police injured in Belfast bomb attack (Reuters)

BELFAST (Reuters) - Two police officers were injured in a bomb attack on the outskirts of Belfast overnight,
the latest of a series of attacks on law enforcement in Northern Ireland, police said September 16.

   Police blamed Irish nationalist militants for bomb attacks on the homes of police officials September 14 near
the city of Londonderry. They did not say who was to blame for the September 16 attack.

   The bomb was thrown at a police patrol as they responded to an alarm call at a toy store shortly after
midnight. The officers' injuries are not thought to be life-threatening. Two members of the store's staff were
treated for shock.

  Officials have said that armed Irish nationalist militants opposed Britain's presence in Northern Ireland are
more active than at any time since a 1998 peace deal. But they lack the wider community support the Irish
Republican Army had during three bloody decades known as "the troubles."

   The 1998 agreement paved the way for a power-sharing government bringing together Protestant loyalists
who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, and
Catholic Irish nationalists who want it to be part of a united Ireland.
