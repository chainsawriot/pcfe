Subject: Arabic Media Engagements

I wanted to flag for all of you some of the incredible engagement our Dubai Hub has been doing on Arabic media
today. There is a huge thirst for US officials communicating our message in Arabic and this is precisely the reason we
have media hubs. Using material from the Secretary's speech in Geneva, Ambassador Rice's engagement yesterday and
the many statements from the last few days, Hub Director Jennifer Rasamimanana has granted a slew of challenging
interviews. For anyone who has ever done a 25 minute interview, just imagine doing it in Arabic!

These are from today alone.



Sabah Al Yom Ya Arab (MBC), 25 minutes
Al Jazeera English, 7 minutes
Sawt Al Arab Radio (Egypt), 5 minutes
ONTV (Egypt), 5 minutes
MTV (Lebanon), 20 minutes
ANB (Dan Ernst interview), 5 minutes
