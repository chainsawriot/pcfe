    •    Voting continues fairly smoothly nationwide. While voting is suppose to halt by 4pm, MINUSTAH is
         requesting an extension of approximately 1 hour to account for late openings in some areas. It is unclear
         if this proposed extension would apply to all voting centers nationwide or exclusively to those located in
         the greater PAP area.

    •    Post reports that generally speaking, the security situation remains better than on November 28. That
         said, MINUSTAH has reported some disturbances in the Nord Est, Ouest, Centre, Grand Anse and the
         Artibonite where Embassy observers reported voter intimidation in St Marc. MINUSTAH reported
         significant disturbances in Dessalines, also in the Artibonite, where MINUSTAH was forced to fire
         shorts to restore order. There is reportedly one fatality resulting from this incident. As a result of these
         disruptions, voting centers in Dessalines have closed early.

    •    Post reports that while the SMS system is still functional there are more than 23,000 SMS messages in
         queue, at telecom companies, waiting to be delivered to voters. This volume explains the delays being
         experienced by voters. There does not appear to be any quick fix to this problem.

    •    Aristide has not made any public addresses as of yet. Preval, who has been absent from the public for
         nearly two weeks, made a public statement after casting his vote. He encouraged Haitians to come out
         and fulfil their civic duty to elect his relacement.
