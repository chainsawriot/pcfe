I'd like to call her.

But right now I'm fighting w the WH operator who doesn't believe I am who I say and wants my direct office line even
tho I'm not there and I just have him my home # and the State Dept # and I told him I had no idea what my direct office
# was since I didn't call myself and I just hung up and am calling thru Ops like a proper and properly dependent Secretary
of State--no independent dialing allowed.

Rep. Watson to retire

By Aaron Blake - 02/10/10 11:51 AM ET

Rep. Diane Watson (D-Calif.) is set to announce her retirement, according to Democratic sources.

Watson's central Los Angeles district isn't expected to be competitive in the general election, as it carries a distinct
Democratic advantage as a majority-minority district. President Barack Obama won it 87-12 in 2008.



Former California State Assembly Speaker Karen Bass is thought to be an early front-runner to replace Watson.

Watson, 76, has served in Congress since 2001. Prior to that, President Bill Clinton appointed her ambassador to
Micronesia.
