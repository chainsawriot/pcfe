Subject: Dr. Rice Budapest 6/30 Coffee

Huma / Alice - Greetings from Budapest.

Dr. Rice asked that I reach out to you directly with regards to the invitation we received to attend a coffee tomorrow
morning (6/30) with the Secretary, CODELS, etc. in Budapest.

She is very appreciative of the invite but must regret her attendance at the coffee. She looks forward to seeing the
Secretary at the Lantos Institute event and hopes that on a future visit to DC she and Secretary Clinton might be able to
get together for a private lunch or dinner.

Regards,
Colby
