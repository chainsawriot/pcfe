Subject: Ahmadinejad denounces arrest of his allies (AP)


TEHRAN (AP) - Iran's embattled president has denounced recent arrests of his allies on corruption charges and
has warned against detentions of any Cabinet members.
  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Wednesday the arrests are "politically motivated" and seek to pressure his
government.
  Dozens of the president's allies have been detained over the past months in an evolving power struggle
between Ahmadinejad and Iran's clerical leaders.
  Four senior government officials were arrested last week. There have also been calls by hard-liners for the
arrest of Ahmadinejad's chief of staff.
  Ahmadinejad is believed to be maneuvering to set up a possible successor in the 2013 presidential elections
and to be seeking to manipulate parliamentary elections slated for March 2012.
