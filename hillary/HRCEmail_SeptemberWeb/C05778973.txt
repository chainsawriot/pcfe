Subject: Egyptian army takes down tents on Tahrir Square

CAIRO (AP) - Egypt's military is taking down the makeshift tents of protesters who camped out on Tahrir
Square in an effort to allow traffic and normal life to return to central Cairo.
   There were a few verbal altercations between soldiers and protesters Sunday morning as the tents were
removed, but the process was generally peaceful.
   The military has called on protesters to return home. Some of the demonstrators are refusing to clear out.
   Protester Ashraf Ahmed said the military can tear down his tent, but that he's not going to leave "because so
much still needs to be done. They haven't implemented anything yet."
   Traffic also returned for the first time in more than two weeks to Tahrir, which was the epicenter of 18-days
of protests that toppled President Hosni Mubarak.
