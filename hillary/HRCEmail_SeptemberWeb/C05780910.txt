I just heard back from the team -- they are monitoring the storms but do not foresee a problem right now. I said I would
check in with them at 1:00pm and will report back.

I'm worried about the weather forecasts for thunderstorms. Can you pis check if I should leave earlier (or later?) to be
safe?

They can basically do whatever you'd like -- should we say 6:00pm?

Bill can't get home until late tomorrow so is there any chance I could either leave later or take a later shuttle?
