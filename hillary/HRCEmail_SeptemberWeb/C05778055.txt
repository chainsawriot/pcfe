national institution likely to survive all the current uncertainty.

Hossam sounded almost relieved at the proposal of a conversation between A-G and S.

I also told Hossam that D(S) would seek A-G out on the ground.

not a decision maker.). But he also is concerned our public comments are being interpreted as throwing M under the
bus.
