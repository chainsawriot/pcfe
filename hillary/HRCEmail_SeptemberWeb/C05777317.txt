Subject: Israeli PM defends east Jerusalem construction (AP)

JERUSALEM (AP) -Israel's prime minister is defending new construction in east Jerusalem that has drawn â€¢
international condemnation. PM Netanyahu said the building of a new Israeli enclave in the Palestinian
neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah is a private project "in accordance with Israeli law." In a statement, he said Israel
will not "impose a ban on Jews purchasing private property in Jerusalem" and that Arabs can buy or rent
property in Jewish neighborhoods.
