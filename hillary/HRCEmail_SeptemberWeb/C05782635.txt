Subject: Haiti's long wait for prime minister may be over (AP)


   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti - (AP) Haitian senators are expected to approve President Michel Martelly's
third pick for prime minister, ending the new leader's monthslong bid to establish a government.
   The president of the Senate says the members will vote later Monday on the nomination of Garry Conille to
run the government in the troubled nation. The Chamber of Deputies unanimously approved Conille's
appointment on Sept. 16.
   The Haitian parliament rejected the first two candidates nominated by Martelly, who took office in May. That
has prevented the new leader from acting on his agenda and slowed earthquake reconstruction.
   Conille is a doctor and was an aide to former U.S. President Bill Clinton in Clinton's role as U.N. envoy to
Haiti.
