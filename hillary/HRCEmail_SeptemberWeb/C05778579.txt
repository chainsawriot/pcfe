Clinton in a aqueaker

We knew the race between Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and her
predecessor, Condoleezza Rice, for most-traveled secretary in the first two years in office, was
going to be a nail-biter - and it was.

But, in the end, Clinton, with a late flurry of January jaunts - including a six-day 16,500-miler to
the Middle East - broke the tape with a virtual last-minute, one-day trip on Jan. 30 to Haiti. (The
two-year count, compiled by our colleague Glenn Kessler, ends on Jan. 31 because a new
administration's Cabinet members aren't confirmed until late January.)

So, the final standings:

Clinton - 165 days on the road, 40 trips.

Rice - 163 days on the road, 39 trips.

Warren Christopher - 148 days, 28 trips.

Madeleine K Albright - 146 days, 35 trips.

James A. Baker III- 139 days, 27 trips.

Cohn L. Powell - 127 days, 29 trips.
