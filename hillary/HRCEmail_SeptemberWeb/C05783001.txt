Subject: Afghan lawmakers OK funds for Kabul Bank bailout (AP)


KABUL (AP) - Afghan lawmakers have agreed to reimburse the government for bailing out the Kabul Bank,
which nearly collapsed last year.
   The lower house on Saturday passed a bill to provide up to $825 million over the next eight years to
recapitalize Afghanistan's central bank.
   The bank's troubles began after reports that top bank executives issued more than $800 million worth of
questionable loans to shareholders, Afghan officials and friends.
   Finance Minister Omar Zakhilwal says he hopes Saturday's decision will lead the International Monetary
Fund to extend Afghanistan a new line of credit.
   Afghanistan has been without IMF backing for more than a year, threatening to choke off billions in aid to
the country.
   Zalchilwal says $70 million worth of questionable loans has been recovered.
