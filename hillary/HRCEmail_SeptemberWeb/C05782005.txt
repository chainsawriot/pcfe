Subject: Business Leaders Support State/USAID Budget

Today, the USGLC sent the attached letter to Capitol Hill signed by over 50 business leaders in support of the
International Affairs Budget. We also placed a full-page ad in Politico today -
http://www.usglc.orewp-content/uploads/2011/06/USGLC-Full-Page-Ad-Business-Leaders-PoliticoFINAL.pdf

This is part of our growing campaign to showcase business support for the State/USAID budget and make the economic
argument. More coming on the 12th but thought you would want to see this.
Best, Liz
