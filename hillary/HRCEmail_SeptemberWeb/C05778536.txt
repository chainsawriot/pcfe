Subject: Over 20,000 take to streets in Yemen "Day of Rage" (Reuters)

SANAA (Reuters) - More than 20,000 Yemenis filled the streets of Sanaa on Thursday for a "Day of Rage"
rally, demanding a change in government and saying President Ali Abdullah Saleh's offer to step down in 2013
was not enough.
    Further anti-government protests were expected across Yemen, which Saleh has ruled for over three decades,
and supporters of the president were driving around the capital urging Yemenis over loudspeakers to join pro-
government counterdemonstrations.
    But by early morning, anti-government protesters had already gathered the largest crowd since a wave of
protests hit the Arabian Peninsula state two weeks ago, inspired by protests that toppled Tunisia's ruler and
threaten Egypt's president.
    "The people want regime change," protesters shouted as they gathered outside Sanaa University. "No to
corruption, no to dictatorship."
