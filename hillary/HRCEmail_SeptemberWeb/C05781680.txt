We just briefed Mark Toner, with the attached press guidance: He was going to get in touch with AP's
Matt Lee to provide a comment using our guidance.

Press guidance is attached and background below.

Background: A Little League team from Uganda qualified to compete in the 2011 Little League
World Series, reportedly the first African team to ever reach the final level of sixteen. This feat has
gained considerable press attention in Africa.
                                                                                                          B3 INA




Little League Headquarters informs us that their press statement will say only that the Department
informed them the documents presented in support of the visa applications contained serious
discrepancies. If asked for specifics, they will state that privacy laws prevented the Department from
disclosing to them any further details.
                                                                                                          B3 INA

For all the good work you guys do in PD, something like this happens, becomes a PR nightmare and undoes all the good
will.
This is the first African team to qualify for the Little League World Series ... and State denies them visas.




STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) â€” The U.S. State Department has denied visas to enter the United States for a
youth baseball team from Uganda that qualified for the Little League World Series.

Officials at Little League headquarters in South Williamsport said Friday that the State Department did not give
a reason for the decision other than that documentation provided by the team "contained discrepancies."

The Rev. John Foundation Little League team from Kampala would have become the first squad from the
continent of Africa to compete in the World Series, which starts next month.

Little League president Stephen Keener said in a statement the organization would take a few days to decide
how to proceed. The Uganda team had won the Middle East and Africa region tournament.
