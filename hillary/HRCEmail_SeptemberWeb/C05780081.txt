No statement (I guess is better than bad statement).

Subject: AL/UN outcome

A little murky right now, but our best understanding is the AL/UN meeting ended without agreement on the
communiqué, with the AU resisting the political language supported by the EU, and Amr Moussa trying to mediate. We
attended the press conference about an hour ago where Ban Ki Moon and Ashton both delivered the three points
(inclusive transition starts now, Qaddafi has lost legitimacy and must go) in their statements, while Moussa and OIC SyG
Oglu left it out. Ogiu said the OIC supports the AU and Turkish initiatives, and said there should be a cease fire and an
inclusive political process. We understand discussions on the communiqué continued after the press conference. Our
EU contacts here are pessimistic that communiqué language will be agreed. Will pass on any further insight as we get it.
