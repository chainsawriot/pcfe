Here is the note I referred to.

Another point people made to Dafna â€” our embassy should be meeting now with as many opposition leaders and
potentially "new-guard" young gun NDP types. The problem is that they are all on lockdown. We could work through
NDI or other NGOs to start outreach with the opposition tomorrow if the situation is any calmer (perhaps wishful
thinking). As in Tunisia, there might well be a gap between the demands of the amorphous and diverse protestors
(many of whom are angry youths) and the positions of the organized opposition groups. Still, taking stock of the red
lines from labor, the Egyptian Movement for Change, and other political and civil society groups would be good advance
work for any eventuality.
