Subject: Yemen PM to return from Riyadh after attack on Saleh (Reuters)



RIYADH (Reuters) - Yemen's prime minister will return home later on Tuesday from Saudi Arabia, where he
has been recovering from injuries suffered in a June assassination attempt on President Ali Abdullah Saleh, a
government source said.

  Ali Mohamed Megawar will be the first senior politician injured in the blast to go back to Yemen after
undergoing medical treatment in neighbouring Saudi Arabia.

   The speaker of Yemen's appointed upper house of parliament died in Riyadh on Monday from wounds
incurred during the explosion in a mosque that wounded Saleh and a number of his aides.

   Last week Saleh said in a televised address he would go back "soon" to the impoverished Arabian Peninsula
state, which has been paralysed by months of protests against his 33-year rule.
