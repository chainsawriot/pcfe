Mario and alonzo both say earlier the better. They think 2pm is ok but they wouldn't go any later than that.
Let's see if the shuttles this am are affected cause of weather. So we can reassess in an hour or 2.

I'm willing to leave whenever it makes most sense so I don't have to worry about the weather. What do you think?
