Hillary Clinton Calls on Tech Women and Green Girls for Global Change

Friday night, I waited at the San Francisco Marriott Marquis, surrounded by Bomb Squad vehicles and black bulletproof
SUVS, for Hillary Clinton <http://www.blogher.com/frame.php?url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/115321.htm> to
speak to an audience of 1,400, only her third appearance in the United States since she took office as Secretary of State
in early 2009. Upon entering the room, she grinned widely and received a standing ovation, welcomed with open arms
by the loyal crowd. After a brief introduction, she cut straight to the point. The government needs innovation to solve
our problems and the world's problems. And she meant it.

I live tweeted <http://www.bloghercom/frame.php?url=http://www.twittercom/sairy> much of the event, including a
lengthy Q&A that brought up issues all over the world, starting with Afghanistan, leading to our neighbors, Canada and
Mexico. E.B. Boyd of FastCompany described the call for tech innovators quite well
<http://www.bloghercom/frame.php?url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1695514/hillary-clinton-silicon-valley-
commonwealth-club> in her article, and the full transcript of the event
<http://www.bloghercom/frame.php?url=http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/10/149542.htm> was published
on the State.gov website. So while I could regurgitate many quotes from the two hour Commonwealth Club
<http://www.blogher.com/frame.php?url=http://commonwealthclub.org> event again here, I won't. Instead, I'll focus
on the fine points affecting women, girls and bloggers -- our community here at BlogHer.

The world is broken in so many ways. We're reminded of it every day with photos of flooded villages, exploding cities,
and starving children. Rather than taking the "glass half empty" approach and leaving it for other people to deal with,
Secretary Clinton holds onto optimism. Slowly, over generations, she believes we can solve these problems through
collaboration across governments and cultures, paired with innovative thinking and an entrepreneurial spirit. Included in
this, not just as an afterthought, comes the role of women and girls.

It's no secret Clinton is an advocate for women's rights, but she has also become a champion of global education for all,
based not only on her personal conviction but on numerous data sources showing how educating girls can change entire
communities. The State Department understands that this is a complex undertaking. But these communities also need
protection. In order to help them, Clinton explains, we must equip their governments and their people with the
knowhow and a multitude of resources and tools to continue developing on their own. Afghanistan is only one example
of this, and the mWomen global initiative
<http://www.bloghercom/frame.php?url=http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/10/149180.htm> puts cell phones
directly in the hands of women who need them for basic communications and commerce.

Meanwhile, in more developed regions, we can provide mentorship opportunities. That's where State's new
Tech Women initiative
<http://www.bloghercom/frame.php?url=http://exchanges.state.gov/programs/professionals/techwomen.html>
comes in. Implemented by the Institute of International Education and the Anita Borg Institute for Women and
Technology, Tech Women <http://www.blogher.com/frame.php?url=http://www.techwomen.orgh will bring 38
women from Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, the West Bank and Gaza for five weeks of mentorship by leaders
in Silicon Valley companies, including Google, Twitter, HP Labs, Facebook, Symantec along with Bay Area based
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories.

Tech Women provides just one way of opening up dialogues between women on how to innovate to solve global
problems. It's part of her view on "21st Century Statecraft." The State Department has also, over the past 20 months,
taken extraordinary leaps in terms of new media, for those who haven't noticed. Just look at their website now
<http://www.blogher.com/frame.php?url=http://www.state.gov> vs. two years ago

Archive.org), view their Twitter feed <http://www.blogher.com/frame.php?url=http://www.twitter.com/statedept> , or
observe their Facebook page <http://www.bloghercom/frame.php?url=http://www.facebook.com/usdos> . They're not
just giving the Gov 2.0 movement lip service; they're full partners.

Which brings me back to girls. The final question from the Q&A on Friday night was from a young girl. She asked, "I am
10 years old and I'm worried about my future environment. What can people do to help?" Clinton's soft spot couldn't
have been more obvious. She beamed at the young girl and told her "there is a lot that you can do."

Clinton continued to explain that in her experience, "young people are much more environmentally conscious and
committed to protecting the world you're growing up in than some of us older people are." (Earlier in the Q&A, she
emphasized her extreme displeasure at the lack of strong environmental legislation coming out of the Senate.) She then
provided a disclaimer that she can't comment on politics as Secretary of State, but noted, "speaking as a private citizen, I
think people running for office should be asked to explain their positions on what they're going to do." In other words,
improve transparency about what candidates plan to do for the environment and other important issues when they're
elected, and hold them accountable.

After another standing ovation, Clinton stepped off the ballroom stage and departed the hotel, along with the Secret
Service, Bomb Squad trucks and darkened motorcade. But she left behind a room full of proactive thinkers, dreamers
and doers, the majority of whom were women, who will take her words to heart and make them happen. I implore the
BlogHer community to join in this worthy endeavor.
