Subject: Succession speculation as NKorea parliament meets (AP)


SEOUL (AP) - North Korean legislators are gathering for a parliamentary session amid speculation that Kim
Jong Ii may appoint his son to a key defense post.
   North Korea's official state media says delegates have been arriving in the capital, Pyongyang, for a meeting
of the Supreme People's Assembly session on Thursday.
   Attention is focused on whether son Kim Jong Un will be elected to the National Defense Commission. Such
a move would further solidify the young man's standing as North Korea's next leader.
   The parliamentary meeting is North Korea's first major national meeting since Kim Jong Un made his
political debut in September. Analysts say appointment to the National Defense Commission would be the next
step in the succession movement.
