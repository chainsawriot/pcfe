Subject:                          Pakistan



I had several conversations with Cameron Munter last week. He mentioned that he had discussed with you the
possibility of having a high level DoS review of the current Pakistan strategy. Just wanted you to know that I would be
happy to participate and/or help move that forward in any way I can. It is unquestionably one of the most
frustrating situations I have ever encountered. The stakes are so high and yet there are no clear paths forward or end in
sight to the challenges we face.

Let me know if there is anything you would like me to do.
