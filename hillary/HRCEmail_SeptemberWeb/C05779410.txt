I'll email him, he can provide my contact to the reporter, and we can offer a statement if you'd like.

Dear Hillary,
  hope you are taking care of yourself while you are taking care of the world. If you can find the time, I would
like your assistance. The New York Times is interested in writing a profile about the Child Mind Institute and
me. Are you available to speak with the reporter, Abby Elin, on my behalf? If so, I would like to give someone
in your office her contact information to set a time to talk. (Don't forget to tell her what a great dancing
couple we are.)


For your convenience, a brief overview of the Child Mind Institute's current work is attached.


Thank you once again. I look forward to hearing from you.


With my warmest regards
Harold
