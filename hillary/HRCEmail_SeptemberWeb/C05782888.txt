 Hello from LA. On way back to SF
                                                                                                                          1.4(B)

 Or I could do a short summary note for her.

 In any case I want to keep her up to date.

 I will be seeing the greek finance Min next week in DC as well.

  Regards,
  Bob

  Many thanks Dan,
  Sounds very serious indeed. I will be with S in san Fran toward the end of the week. I will relay any points you would like
  me to give her. If she needs to make a call, please let me know.

        As I noted earlier, there is an increasing sense here that something is about to give - either the
government has to show much greater determination and willingness to make tough choices, or the
Europeans are going to decide that they need to let Greece go and protect their banks as well as
they can. Thus far, during this latest crisis, the government has not reached out to the Opposition for
help. I'll keep you posted, Dan

Terrific. I don't think that Samaras will be there next week, but we will check with Venizelos.

Dear Bob,




          Prime Minister Papandreou stuck to the usual script in his annual speech in Thessaloniki over the
 weekend, but announced no new measures. Venizelos, however, announced a new property tax levy (to be
 collected via electricity bills) in a desperate effort to raise more revenue. There is widespread backlash against
 this latest tax increase. Even those who have supported the government up until now believe that this is the
 wrong way to go and that the PASOK government is refusing to do what really needs to be done which is to

slash public expenditures by eliminating positions or furloughing unneeded employees, and to get serious about
collecting taxes from those who still do not pay.

        Against this backdrop, we continue to hear more and more rumors of either early elections or some sort
of "grand coalition" government. The problem is, of course, that early elections will not likely resolve
anything. New Democracy leader Samaras has not changed his critical tone and continues to insist that
somehow he would be in a better position to "negotiate" with the Troika. While New Democracy did join
forces with the government last month in passing much-needed educational reform, they have not shown any
inclination to help the government on much tougher measures to streamline the bureaucracy and trim public
expenditures. In their defense, however, the ruling party itself remains intensely divided on this score, which is
doubtless why the government keeps going back to the same well when it comes to short-term taxes or revenue
"fixes."

       What more can I say? Most Greeks are back from their August vacations, strikes are again a daily
occurrence, and more labor and social unrest seems likely. The weather, however, is terrific. I will keep you
posted. All the best, Dan

Hi Dan,
I have been hearing some bad things. What do you think is likely to happen in the next few days?

Hoping to see FinMin in DC next week.

Bob
