Subject: Mideast peacemakers fail to agree on way ahead (AP)

WASHINGTON (AP) - The United States and its partners in the international diplomatic "quartet" on the
Middle East have failed to reach agreement on how to restart Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
   That deals a blow to efforts to avert a looming confrontation at the United Nations over recognizing Palestine
as an independent nation.
   A senior U.S. official says a June 11 meeting between Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, U.N.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, E.U. foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton and Russian Foreign Minister
Sergey Lavrov was unable to produce a unified statement on how to proceed.
   The official says that "much more work" needs to be done before the quartet can issue a call for the parties to
re-launch negotiations.
   The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private working dinner at the State Department.
