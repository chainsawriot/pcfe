Subject: Arab League selects Egyptian nominee as new head (AP)

CAIRO - (AP) Egypt replaced its candidate for head of the Arab League at the last minute on Sunday,
backing its foreign minister for the job. The candidate, Foreign Minister Nabil Elaraby, was quickly elected to
the top post.
  The 22-member Arab organization chose Elaraby as secretary-general to replace Amr Moussa, a former
Egyptian foreign minister who has said he will run for the office of president in Egypt.
