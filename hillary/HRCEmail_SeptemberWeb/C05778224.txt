If we go to Paris,



Also, if we go to Paris, I assume I will come back that same night. If that's right, can I either land at Westchester or fly up
from Andrews?

If I don't go to Paris, how will we add one more trip since I doubt I can go to Haiti?

Are we now thinking of flying to Munich Thursday night instead of Fri morning?

When I go to Hawaii for APEC,
                         Huma has contact info.

Is there a set date for the Friends of Yemen in Saudi Arabia?

Are we still thinking of a speech about Latin America? If so, should do before mid-March. What's status of Brookings
event for former Lat Am leaders?

Sending you copy of letter from Dick Blum inviting me to speak at his poverty center at Berkeley. â€¢

Also need to find out dates for Japanese PM visit from WH.
