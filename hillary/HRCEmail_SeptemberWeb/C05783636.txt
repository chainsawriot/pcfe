Subject: Photos from Embassy Kabul Independence Day Party

Please thank the Secretary for sending us some great words of support which we read to the
Team during our community Independence Day celebration here in Kabul. A big hit! Some
photos of the event attached. As well, the Secretary's call to our Mission was really well-
received. Strongly recommend these be continued to scheduled during the Dec-Jan Holiday
season and on the cusp of the summer turnover. Extraordinary impact on morale.

Best,

Karl
