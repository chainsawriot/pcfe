Subject: U.N. Security Council eases sanctions on Libya (Reuters)


UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The UN Security Council Friday eased sanctions on Libya, including on its
national oil company and central bank, to enable key institutions to resume operations after a civil war. The 15-
nation council voted unanimously for a resolution that also establishes a UN mission in Libya to help the North
African nation get back on its feet after the overthrow of Col. Qadhafi.
