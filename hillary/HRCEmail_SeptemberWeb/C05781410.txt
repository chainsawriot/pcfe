 Subject: messages for S from the Sultan of Oman



 S Staff: I'd be grateful if you could pass this as appropriate to the Secretary.

 Last night, I saw Omar Zawawi, the close advisor/confidante to Sultan Qabous of Oman; Dr.
 Omar was the gentleman who sat to the Secretary's right at the January lunch hosted by the
 Sultan in Muscat. Dr. Omar,                                    welcomed my visit to Muscat                          B6
 next week, but he said that he had two messages for the Secretary from the Sultan:

 1) The Sultan would be very honored if the Secretary could attend the opening of Muscat's
 opera on October 12. If there is any possibility of acceptance, a more formal invitation
 would be conveyed. But the Sultan is looking for guidance as to whether this would be a
 possibility and appropriate or not.




                                                                                                     1.4(B)

                                                                                                     B1
