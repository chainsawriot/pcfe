Subject: Palestinian faults Arabs over Jerusalem support (Reuters)

RAMALLAH (Reuters) - Arab states are failing to help the Palestinians in Jerusalem, a Palestinian official said
on January 19, criticising them for paying only a fraction of funds pledged to sustain Palestinian life
there. Foreign Minister Riad Malki's comments reflected the Palestinians' frustration over the Arab failure to
support them in the face of what they see as an Israeli campaign to "Judaize" Jerusalem, the city at the heart of
the Middle East conflict.

Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, addressing an Arab economic summit in Egypt on January 19, said
the city faced a "bitter reality" and urged the leaders to implement their previous resolutions on supporting
Jerusalem. Malki, in an interview with the official Palestinian news agency WAFA, said the Palestinians had so
far received only $37 million of $500 million pledged by Arab leaders at a summit in Libya in 2010.
