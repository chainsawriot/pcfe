Subject: Hague Speech Today on Cyber Agreement

Jake: FM Hague made a speech today getting some play (e.g. front page of the Euro edition of the Financial
Times): he proposes a cybersecurity agreement. As far as I know, the particular shape of the idea is brand-new,
and there aren't any points on this in the Secretary's materials, so I asked Michele Markoff, our cyber expert, to
do a few points just in case. I'm pasting them in below. If you or anybody in the traveling party would like to
speak with Michele, her email is above. Travel safely. RG
p.s. The East-West Institute also released a report today on a U.S.-Russia project they've been running on this
matter; thus the if-asked question below.
