Working on it. As you know, Mike Hammer and Dana Smith are doing a terrific job. I think we have a good plan for
getting things off to a quick start. The challenge now is to make this part of the Department's communications "dna".
                                                                                                                        B5
            We are working with them to review existing programs and identify ways of shifting resources from lower
impact initiatives to provide support for their social media activities. Challenging but we will get there.

Subject: Arabic Media Engagements

I wanted to flag for all of you some of the incredible engagement our Dubai Hub has been doing on Arabic media
today. There is a huge thirst for US officials communicating our message in Arabic and this is precisely the reason we
have media hubs. Using material from the Secretary's speech in Geneva, Ambassador Rice's engagement yesterday and
the many statements from the last few days, Hub Director Jennifer Rasamimanana has granted a slew of challenging
interviews. For anyone who has ever done a 25 minute interview, just imagine doing it in Arabic!

These are from today alone.
