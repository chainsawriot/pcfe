 Subject: HRC in Paris

 Huma: please pass the following message to Secretary Clinton if possible:

 Secretary Clinton:

 Just wanted to write and congratulate you on your leadership inside the administration in the matter of Libya. I can only
 imagine the dynamic of French and British leaders racing ahead while some in the U.S. Administration were reluctant. It
 appears that you not only helped bring the administration to a laudable place but also handled the international
 diplomacy with great skill in a situation where the United States has chosen to change its traditional posture in
 international affairs.

 With warm personal regards, affection and praise, your friend, Jamie.
