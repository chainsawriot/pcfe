Subject: Al Qaeda official killed in Yemen, pipeline blown up (Reuters)

ADEN (Reuters) - The head of the media department of the Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula
was killed in an air raid on militant outposts in Yemen and gunmen responded by blowing up a pipeline used to
export gas, Yemeni officials and residents said on Saturday.

    The Yemeni Defence Ministry said Ibrahim al-Banna, an Egyptian national, died in a raid by Yemeni war
planes on militant positions in Shabwa province in southern Yemen late on Friday. Residents and local officials
said they believed the raids were conducted by foreign aircraft. Unidentified assailants, believed to be militants,
later blew up a gas pipeline.
