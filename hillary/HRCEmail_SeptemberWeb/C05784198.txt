Subject: EU's Ashton In east Libya offers rebels support (Reuters)

BENGHAZI, Libya, May 22 (Reuters) - European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton pledged support
for rebels in east Libya on Sunday, making the most senior visit to the area by a foreign official since a revolt
against Muammar Gaddafi began.

   "I saw the posters on the way from the airport to here saying 'We have a dream' and I'm here today to explain
not only about our short-term support but also the breadth of our support," Ashton said in the rebel stronghold
of Benghazi.

   Visiting to open a representative office for the EU, Ashton toured the square next to the Benghazi court
house, epicentre of the revolt that erupted in mid-February.

   Several Libyans surrounded her, flicking "V-for-Victory" signs. One man nearby said: "Every Libyan is very
happy."

   Ashton's visit "shows the increased support of the European Union in supporting us to have a democratic
and free state", said the head of the Benghazi-based National Transitional Council, Mustafa Abdel Jalil.

   "The Libyan people appreciate this visit and appreciate the European Union for supporting the revolution
since its beginning," he added.

    Ashton said she discussed support for health, education, civil society, border management and security
reform.

   "We seek to support, not just now, but for the future and as long as the people of this country wish us there,"
she said.

   Western diplomatic sources told Reuters last week the EU was considering tightening sanctions on
Gaddafi's government by blacklisting ports to prevent oil exports and fuel imports.

   One source said EU experts had reached an agreement to put six ports -- Tripoli, Zuara, Zawiyah, Al-
Khoms, Ras Lanuf and Brega -- on the list. Proposals could be submitted to the EU sanctions committee next
week.

  Another EU diplomat said the measure could be discussed by foreign ministers who meet in Brussels on
Monday.
