Subject: Israel apologizes for Egyptian troop deaths (AP)



JERUSALEM - (AP) Israel's Defense Minister says Israel is sorry for the deaths of Egyptian troops killed
during a shootout between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian militants.
   Ehud Barak says he has ordered a military investigation and a joint inquiry with the Egyptian army to clarify
the circumstances of Friday's incident, when militants from Gaza crossed into southern Israel through the
Egyptian desert and launched a deadly attack that killed eight Israeli.
   At least three Egyptian troops were killed in a subsequent shootout between Israeli soldiers pursuing the
militants along the Israeli-Egypt border. Egypt said Saturday it would recall its ambassador from Israel to
protest the deaths.
   Barak says that "Israel is sorry over the deaths of the Egyptian officers."
