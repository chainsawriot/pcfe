Pls keep track for me of two concert dates for Carole King and James Taylor: June 8 in DC and June 15 in NY




I'd like to meet w the columnist Tom Friedman--maybe for lunch? ,

Sometime in late spring I'd like to have a dinner at either State or my house for Admin women--including Michelle
Obama. Just raising it to discuss.

Let's try to schedule dinner w Jim Jones and his wife and Bill whenever that can be.

I still want to go to West Point and just heard Hagenbeck is leaving in June so need to find date soon.

Have we offered date to McConnell yet? Let's look at overseas travel, make decisions tomorrow and be sure we get this
done.

I need a date on a weekend for Mort Zuckerman's dinner for Elie Wiese!.
