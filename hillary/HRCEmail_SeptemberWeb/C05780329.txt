Subject: Secretary Call to the Field

Marc,

Last December, the Secretary made an open conference call to the Civilian Team in
Afghanistan; the technology worked and the feedback was terrific (Frank Ruggiero very
effectively quarterbacked the session).

Would recommend another such call be planned sometime in June. Reasons:

• Summer turnover starting and she could thank many for their year of service (and encourage
  the bow wave of new arrivals)

• Taliban offensive has been felt by our civilians in the field; threat levels, attacks and
  incidents are all up; good time to express gratitude for valorous service.

• With Transition and troop withdrawals imminent, good opportunity for the Secretary to let
  the Civilian Team receive her guidance directly and take some questions.


Let us know what you think.

Best,

Karl
