Subject: U.S. official: Al-Qaida's No. 2 killed in Pakistan (AP)

WASHINGTON (AP) - A senior Obama administration official says al-Qaida No. 2 leader, Atiyah Abd al-
Rahman, has been killed in Pakistan.
   Al-Rahman was a Libyan national who was considered al-Qaida's operational leader before rising to the No.
2 spot following Osarna bin Laden's death in May.
   Al-Rahman's death is a big blow to the terrorist group and comes as U.S. officials have said in the aftermath
of bin Laden's killing that a few more high-profile deaths could break al-Qaida's back.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence operations, says al-
Rahman was killed Aug. 22 in the Pakistani tribal region of Waziristan. That's the same day a US drone strike
in Waziristan.
