Subject: WaPo story coming Sun or Mon

Team - Despite our efforts, WaPo will proceed with its story on US-Turkey intel cooperation against PKK. They will not
make redactions we requested so expect the Wikileaks cables to be published in full. S + Burns have been briefed on
this story. Working with EUR and NEA press, we're deploying guidance below, including our standing Wikileaks
guidance. Thanks to everyone who helped work this, particularly - Barbara, Lavallee, and Hilton and Steve's SES team -
wish I had better news to share.

0 We condemn the illegal disclosure of classified information. In addition to damaging our diplomatic efforts, it
threatens our national security and undermines our effort to work with countries to solve shared problems.

El We do not comment on intelligence matters.

111Turkey is a longstanding ally and partner of the United States and we continue to support Turkey in its struggle against
PKK terrorism through various forms of cooperation.

M We support continued cooperation between Iraq and Turkey in combating the PKK, which is a common enemy of
Turkey, Iraq, and the United States. We condemn the PKK as a terrorist organization and demand that it cease its
terrorist actions and unconditionally lay down arms.
