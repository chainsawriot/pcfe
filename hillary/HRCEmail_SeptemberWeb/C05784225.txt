JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel's defense minister has approved the building of 277 apartments in a West Bank
settlement, defying U.S. criticism of continued construction on lands the Palestinians claim for a state.
   Defense Minister Ehud Barak authorized the construction in Arid, the core of the settlement bloc deepest
inside the West Bank. One hundred of the apartments will house Israelis evacuated in 2005 from a Gaza Strip
settlement.
   A spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had no immediate comment Monday on the
diplomatically charged move.
   In recent weeks, Israel has also moved ahead on two other construction projects in east Jerusalem, the
Palestinians' hoped-for capital. The U.S. was critical of those plans.
