Subject: Brazil on Iran

FYI- I used Secretary Clinton's travel to inauguration of incoming Brazilian President Rousseff with Brazilian Amb - as way
to raise and encourage consideration of potential Brazilian co-sponsorship of HRC resolution seeking mandate for a SR
on Iran.

She has now raised it with the incoming FM- they have the subject under consideration.

Just thought I would keep you posted in case there is a way to slip in S talking points.
