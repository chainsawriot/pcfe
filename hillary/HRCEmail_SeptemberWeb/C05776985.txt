That was an unbelievably complex and difficult meeting, but you are an absolutely amazing lawyer. You deftly got us to
every position we have been trying to get to for months. And you were utterly forthright in speaking up for Principle and
the Rule of Law. As always, I am so proud to know you and to work with you.
