Subject: Secretary Call to the Field

Marc,

Last December, the Secretary made an open conference call to the Civilian Team in
Afghanistan; the technology worked and the feedback was terrific (Frank Ruggiero very
effectively quarterbacked the session).

Would recommend another such call be planned sometime in June. Reasons:

• Summer turnover starting and she could thank many for their year of service (and encourage
  the bow wave of new arrivals)

• Taliban offensive has been felt by our civilians in the field; threat levels, attacks and
  incidents are all up; good time to express gratitude for valorous service.

• With Transition and troop withdrawals imminent, good opportunity for the Secretary to let
  the Civilian Team receive her guidance directly and take some questions.

Best,
