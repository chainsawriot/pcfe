TANZANIA/UNITED NATIONS

The tourism minister said Tanzania still plans to build a highway through the Serengeti wildlife park, contradicting a
UNESCO announcement which said the project had been abandoned. The minister said 75 miles of the road will be
made of gravel, which will minimize impact on the millions of wildebeests and zebra that annually cross the Serengeti.
