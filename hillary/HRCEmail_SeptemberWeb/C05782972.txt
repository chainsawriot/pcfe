Subject: Loyalist forces, opposition fight in Yemen capital (AP)



SANAA (AP) - Troops loyal to Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh and forces opposed to his rule are
engaged in heavy fighting across much of the capital Sanaa, with rockets, mortars and heavy machine-guns
being used.
   The fighting began shortly after midnight and intensified around 3 a.m. local time Monday, with the sound of
explosions rocking many parts of the city.
   There were no overall casualty figures immediately available, but at least three people were killed in the
downtown encampment of tens of thousands of protesters demanding Saleh's ouster, according to medical
officials.
   The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to share the information.
