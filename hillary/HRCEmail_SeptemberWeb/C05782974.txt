From:                             Adams, David S <AdamsDS@state.gov>
Sent:                             Friday, October 14, 201111:20 AM
To:                               H; Nides, Thomas R
Subject:                          Rep. Price



Madam Secretary-Both Deputy Nides and I have reached out to Rep Price. He's tied up in a meeting but I have conveyed
to his staff our request to delay delivery of his letter until at least next week. His staff seems amenable to the delay
while we work the issue with the Gol. He noted that Rep Price would like to speak to Tom and would call him within the
hour.

I've spoken to Torn so he is aware of my conversation with Rep Price's office. Dave
