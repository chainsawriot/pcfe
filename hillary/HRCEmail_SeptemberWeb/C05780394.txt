Report: Weiner's wife sought advice from Hillary Clinton

Anthony Weiner's wife, Huma Abedin, is reported to have sought advice from her boss
and friend, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in the aftermath of the New York Democrat's
admission that he had online sexually charged relationships with other women even after
they married last year.

The Wall Street Journal reports an initial talk between Abedin and Clinton took place early
Monday afternoon, after Weiner told his wife the truth about his behavior that morning, but
the paper doesn't provide details.

Abedin - who initially believed her husband's story that he had been hacked - reacted to
Weiner's revelation with anger and sadness, but stayed composed, a source told The
Journal.

Unlike the wives of other politicians who've admitted affairs, Abedin chose not to appear
publicly with Weiner at his Monday afternoon press conference. "She has seen spouses
stand there before — like SiIda Spitzer — and look a lot less happy," a friend told the New
York Post, referring to the wife of former Gov. Eliot Spitzer (D-N.Y.).

Abedin watched the press conference — which included countless apologies from the
congressman to his wife — on television in New York and, afterwards, went out to dinner
with Weiner and friends and family.

By Tuesday, the Journal says, Abedin returned to work at the State Department in
Washington as she prepared to leave on a weeklong trip to Africa with Clinton.

"She's here, she's upstairs," Philippe Reines, deputy assistant secretary of state, said
Tuesday. "She's doing her job. She hasn't missed a beat throughout."

Clinton and Abedin left on their trip late Tuesday.
