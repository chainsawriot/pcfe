Subject: UN Libya draft calls for all necessary measures-UK (Reuters)

LONDON (Reuters) - The latest draft resolution on Libya under discussion at the United Nations calls for "all
necessary measures short of an occupation force" to protect civilians under threat of attack, Britain said on
Thursday.

   Foreign Secretary William Hague said the latest draft of the resolution to be discussed at the U.N. Security
Council in New York on Thursday followed extensive consultations with Lebanon, France, the United States
and others.

   He said there was no longer anything holding the United States back from supporting a no-fly zone over
Libya, where leader Muammar Gaddafi's troops are advancing on rebels.
