Subject: Anti-military chants at protesters' funeral (AP)



   CAIRO - (AP)      Tens of thousands of Egyptians chanted against the ruling military council during a massive
funeral procession of 17 Christian protesters killed in a Cairo protest.
   Mourners packed the Coptic Christian Cathedral in Cairo overnight on Monday, filling hallways and
corridors as funeral prayers were led by Pope Shenouda III.
   Chants of "down with the military junta" interrupted the prayers, as many accuse the military of bearing
primary responsibility for the violence which led to the deaths of 26 people and the injury of more than 500
others on Sunday.
   The slain protesters were marching towards Cairo's television headquarters. Forensic reports said many
deaths were caused by armored vehicles that ran over protesters or by gunshots.
