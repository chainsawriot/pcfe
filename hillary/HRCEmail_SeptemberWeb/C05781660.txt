Subject: Senate kills latest House debt measure (AP)

 WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate has killed the latest effort by the House to raise the government's
borrowing cap.
   Democrats and several Republicans killed the GOP measure by a 59-41 vote Friday night, just minutes after
it arrived from the House. Democrats opposed the measure because it would require another painful debt-limit
debate early next year.
   The move continues a standoff over the debt limit but could set the table for negotiations this weekend on
compromise legislation that could pass the Democratic Senate and the GOP-controlled House before an Aug. 2
deadline to prevent a potentially disastrous default on U.S. obligations like interest payments and Social
Security checks.
   The measure would have immediately lifted the government's borrowing cap by $900 billion. It barely
squeaked through the House.
