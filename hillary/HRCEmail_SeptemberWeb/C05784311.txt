JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel will stick to its refusal to apologise to Turkey for killing nine of its citizens
aboard a Gaza-bound ship, rejecting a demand by Ankara, an Israeli official said on Wednesday.

    The decision was made days before the publication of the findings of a U.N. inquiry into last year's seizure
of the Mavi Marmara. The so-called Palmer report was repeatedly delayed to allow the former Middle East
allies to try to mend fences.
