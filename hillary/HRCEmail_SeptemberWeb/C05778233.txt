Subject: Hamas says documents show PA working "to liquidate" cause (Reuters)

JERUSALEM(Reuters) - Hamas, the Islamist group which governs the Gaza Strip, said the documents revealed
the Palestinian Authority's role in "attempting to liquidate the Palestinian cause." "This exposes the Palestinian
leadership, putting it in a position where it will be impossible to win the confidence of the people," said Zakaria
al-Qaq, Palestinian commentator.

However, another Palestinian commentator said the reacti9n would be limited. "There won't be any big
reaction, it's not entirely new," said Hany al-Masri, adding that the idea of Israel keeping its large urban
settlements around Jerusalem as part of a land exchange in a final deal had been floated before.
