    Got it Madame Secretary. Will check on Mansfield status and will have a recommendation on abductee families as well
    for morning. Thanks for the warm words and wonderful event for Jim. As you could see it meant the world to him. Kurt

    The FM took me aside as I was leaving to raise three issues:                                                  1.4(D)




    And an upcoming visit to DC by families of the abductees, asking that I find time to meet w them

    Pls advise how to respond. Thx.
