Huma,

Attached please find an action memo and formatted letter for S's approval regarding Raymond Davis. If the Secretary
approves the text, I will have the letter signed electronically and send it back to SRAP.

Jake/Huma â€”

Attached is the final letter from S to Gilani, cleared by post, L, and SRAP. Cameron would like to send this as early as
tomorrow, if possible, as it lays out in the clearest and most succinct manner to date the position the USG has espoused
in the case. It effectively will become the document of record with the government.
