Not a day goes by that I am not thankful for the chance you've given to me to work on issues that mean so much to me. I
am so proud to work for you.

But never was this more so than this week, when amid everything else, you stood up courageously for principle on 686.
Our voice did not prevail, but it was heard, and everyone in my office who worked on this was so very proud that we
have a great leader of conscience as our Secretary.

Happy Thanksgiving to your whole family.

With thanks and respect,
Harold
