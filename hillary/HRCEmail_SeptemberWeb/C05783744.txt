Afternoon all -- Regarding whether this bill is actually moving, Rep. Berman's staff believe that Rep. Smith is likely to try
and offer it as an amendment to the State Department authorization bill that HFAC is scheduled to mark-up next week.

FYI

The enabling legislation [22 usc 6411] establishes an Amb at Large for Rel. Freedom within the Department

The Department has administratively placed the office within DRL, there is nothing in the current statute that requires or
bars such

Frank Wolf has introduced a bill in Congress that would ,among other things, move the office of International Religious
Freedom from DRL to S staff. It is apparently gaining momentum (see below).




Gimme That OC Religion
Locals Push Bill Spreading Religious Freedom By Matt Coker Wed., Jul. 6 2011 at 8:28 AM Comments (2)




A Santa Ana-based group pushing for religious freedom worldwide has launched a new advocacy campaign aimed at
beefing up the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 and, with it, U.S. foreign policy.

Turmoil in Nigeria, the Middle East, Northern Africa and Pakistan--including the burning of churches and killing of
Christians--proves U.S. House Resolution 1856 is critically needed, according to Open Doors USA.



The bill would reauthorize the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) and allow the IRF
office to more effectively endorse religious freedom through advocacy, reporting and programming. The legislation
would also add governments threatening religious freedom to the State Department list of "Countries of Particular
Concern." All foreign service officers would receive religious freedom training.

Under current law, Suzan Johnson Cook, ambassador-at-large for International Religious Freedom, works under the
Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor Michael Posner. With HR 1856, Cook would report directly
to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

"If this bill passes, it will offer a significant advancement in religious freedom worldwide," says Carl Moeller, Open Doors
USA's president and CEO, in a statement from the group. "It is important to urge our U.S. representatives to vote for this
bill."

Lindsay Vessey, Moeller's advocacy director, calls HR 1856 "one of the most important bills for the promotion of
international religious freedom to be introduced. It is critical that HR 1856 be passed before the U.S. Commission on
International Religious Freedom's funding expires in September. It is imperative that constituents let their elected
officials know that religious freedom is important to them and that they campaign for religious freedom for all people of
faith around the world."

Vessey points out that nearly 70 percent of the world's 6.8 billion people live in countries with high restrictions on
religion. Stable, democratic governments in these countries are unlikely to ever succeed without religious freedom,
Open Doors USA argues.
