Subject: Saudi Arabia ends effort to mediate in Lebanon (AP)

BEIRUT (AP) - Saudi Arabia's foreign minister says his country has abandoned efforts to mediate in Lebanon's political crisis. The
decision is also a blow to the influence Washington was able to maintain in Lebanon through its key ally Saudi Arabia. Western-
backed political factions are jockeying for power in Lebanon with the Shiite militant group Hizballah and its allies. In an interview
January 19 with the Saudi-owned Al-Arablya TV, Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal said the Saudi king has decided he is "withdrawing
his hand" from Lebanon. Lebanon is enduring a political crisis stemming from a UN court investigating the assassination of a former
Lebanese prime minister. Hizballah is expected to face indictment.
