its the difference between mario and alonzo, simple as that. he has been very reassuring and we are equally frustrated
watching your flight tracker here. will see if we can call ny and can tell us anything different, and we heard they are also
making plans to drive if necesssary. So Sorry!

I am so unhappy since again no one said a word but as soon as we pulled away from gate we were told we'd wait for 20
minutes and now just told it will be at least an hour but the good news is that they can't keep us out here longer than 3
hours! So, I want to go to plan B--pls do all you can to get us flying and if that doesn't work, I want to drive so have asked
Service and DS to try to work that out.
