hey, have done a terrible job of following her budget testimony (hope it went well today), but if you haven't
already heard DFID announced these plans today--she may get questions and/or she may find it a helpful

Aid budget will be better
focused, say ministers




Andrew Mitchell said it is "morally right' and also "in our national interest" to help the
poorest people in the world

The government is to outline plans to stop direct development aid to 16 countries and freeze
the level of assistance given to India.

But there will be more for Bangladesh, Nigeria and Pakistan as aid is "better focused" on the poorest
people.

 Labour said they believed government policy was "on the right track".

 International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell said aid was being protected from spending
 cuts because it was in the UK's national interest.

 The department's overall £7.8bn budget has been unaffected by the government's deficit cutting
 measures.

 But the UK is expected to stop direct aid to 16 countries, including Russia, China, Vietnam, Serbia
 and Iraq. Some, such as Vietnam and Bosnia, are seen to have "graduated" out of poverty.

 Others are judged to be adequately served by United Nations agencies.

• The government says it wants greater transparency and accountability in aid spending, with an
  emphasis on funding programmes that deliver greater results and which, specifically, help girls and
  women.

 Mr Mitchell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We're ending a culture which has seen large
 sums of money thrown at problems, and focusing on the results that the British taxpayer can buy.

 "This is about value for money, it's about ensuring for every pound we take off hard-pressed
 taxpayers we really do deliver 100 pence of development value."

 Five countries will have their budgets increased substantially - Ethiopia, Bangladesh, Nigeria, the
 Democratic Republic of Congo and Pakistan.

 By 2014, 30% of UK aid is expected to go to war-torn and unstable countries.

 Shadow international development secretary Harriet Harman told the BBC Labour welcomed the
 government's decision to stick with the commitment of spending 0.7% of national income on
 overseas aid.

 "Obviously it's right, as things change, that you review who you give overseas aid money to and how
 you give it - so I think that's right to do as well. So broadly we think the government are on the right
 track.

 "I know it's difficult when people are feeling the pinch here at home, but we have to remember that
 with just a very small amount of money we can save lives in the developing world."

 David Loyn, the BBC's international development correspondent, said: "The government is keenly
 aware of its political vulnerability in ring-fencing the international development budget while cutting
 spending everywhere else except for health, and it wants to ensure that it is getting value for
 money."

 Mr Mitchell was asked on BBC Breakfast about his decision to maintain overseas aid while some
 charities were suffering funding cuts in the UK.

 He said: "We are dealing with a scale of poverty around the world of a completely different order.

 "And we do it because it's morally right, it's about our values as a country and as a government, and
 also because it's in our national interest."

. India is currently one of the biggest recipients of UK development aid, and there have been media
   campaigns in the UK suggesting an economy growing at nearly 10% a year simply does not need
   British assistance.

  But others point out that nearly half a billion people in India - more than in any other country in the
  world - are still desperately poor.

  The government says the new approach will be more effective in cutting poverty, and assist in
  reaching the Millennium Development Goals by the target date of 2015.

On Saturday, it emerged that the UK is threatening to switch funding away from the UN Food and
Agriculture Organization - which focuses on longer-term projects, such as providing seeds and tools
for agriculture - unless its performance improves.

Instead, more funding could go to the World Food Programme, which deals with emergency food aid
around the globe.
