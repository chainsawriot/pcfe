DAMASCUS, Syria - (AP) Activists and eyewitnesses say Syrian army units have deployed in key areas of a
seaside Mediterranean city rocked by protests and unrest.
  They told The Associated Press that troops in army vehicles entered Latakia at night following a day of
violence and chaos in which protesters and the government accused each other of violence and incitement.
  They spoke Sunday on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.
  The government on Saturday accused armed groups of attacking people in the religiously mixed resort city,
adding at least two people were killed by rooftop snipers.
  Protesters accused government forces of opening fire on protesters.
