Happy to talk more about this to strategize over the weekend, if in fact Monday is our last day to shape this.

Best,

Dan and Ashley:

I've been discussing the pending Codel visit to Islamabad with the Walter Douglas. As you know everyone is concerned
about their possible interactions with Pakistanni media.

                                                Thoughts ?
