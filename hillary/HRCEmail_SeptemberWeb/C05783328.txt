Subject: Muslim-Christian clashes erupt at Egyptian church (AP)

CAIRO (AP) - An Egyptian security official says clashes have broken out between Muslims and Christians over
the reopening of a Cairo church the former regime closed years ago.
   Muslim-Christian violence has erupted several times around Egypt since the ouster of President Hosni
Mubarak on Feb. 11.
   Thursday's clashes began when police accompanied a group of Christians to reopen the Church of the Virgin
in Cairo's Ain Shams district.
   More than 1,000 ultraconservative Salafi Muslims and local residents tried to block the way, and the sides
pelted each other with stones. Police detained a number of those involved, and the Christians entered the church
while a smaller protest continued outside. No injuries were reported.
   About 10 percent of Egyptians are Christians.
