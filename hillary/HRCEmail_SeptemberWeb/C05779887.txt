MANAMA (Reuters) - Bahraini Shi'ite opposition leader Hassan Mushaimaa arrived home from exile on
Saturday and was not detained at the airport, witnesses said. Mushaimaa, who was being tried in absentia in an
alleged coup plot, flew to Manama from Lebanon. Bahrain's foreign minister said this week Mushaimaa had
received a royal pardon.
