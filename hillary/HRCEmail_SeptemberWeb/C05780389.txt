Subject: Senators unveil tough resolution on Libya (AP)

WASHINGTON (AP) - A Democratic and a Republican senator have unveiled a resolution calling on President
Barack Obama to seek congressional consent for U.S. military involvement in Libya.
  Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia and Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee introduced the resolution on Wednesday. The
measure builds on the House-passed resolution that rebuked Obama for failing to get authorization from
Congress when he ordered air strikes in March against Moarnmar Gadhafi's forces. The House adopted that
measure Friday.
  The Senate resolution requires the Obama administration to provide detailed justification for the U.S. role in
the NATO-led mission. It also prohibits U.S. ground forces in Libya.
  Corker said he expects the Senate to debate the resolution next week.
