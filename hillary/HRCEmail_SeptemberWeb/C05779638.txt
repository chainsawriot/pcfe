Subject: UK diplomats in Libya to engage with rebels -govt (Reuters)



LONDON, April 3 (Reuters) - Britain said on Sunday it has sent a team of diplomats to Libya meet with rebel
leaders in the eastern town of Benghazi.

  The delegation arrived on Saturday and is headed up by Christopher Prentice, Britain's ambassador to Rome
who also has served as the top British diplomat in Baghdad.

   "It will build on the work of the previous team and seek to establish further information about the Interim
National Council, its aims and more broadly what is happening in Libya," the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office said in a statement.

   A team of British diplomats, which was reported to have included special forces soldiers, was captured by
rebels in Benghazi in early March before being released and returned to Britain.
