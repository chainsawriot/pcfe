"A Bag of Flour," an op-ed by Javed Chaudhry in liberal Urdu daily "Express" (cir. 25,000) (11/02)




"... It was the picture of a U.S. helicopter parked at a helipad in Sukkur. Many people clad in military uniforms were
unloading the relief goods for flood-affected people in the Sindh province. A middle-aged American national, wearing a
shirt and grey pants and carrying a 40-kg flour bag, immediately caught my attention. It took me hardly a few seconds to
recognize him. He was no other than the new U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan, Mr. Cameron Munter. During my recent visit

to the United States, I had the chance to meet him at the residence of our Ambassador in Washington, Mr. Hussain
Haqqani. In a lighter vein, he (Ambassador Munter) asked me and other Pakistani journalists, present on the occasion,
that 'please don't pester me during my stay in Pakistan because I am very scared of the Pakistani media even now in my
own country.' These words garnered a resounding laughter from all of us. It was my first meeting with Ambassador
Munter. Now he is in Pakistan where the U.S. Ambassador is always more busy even than the host country's president.
Within a week after his arrival in Pakistan, the U.S. Ambassador reached Sukkur along with relief goods for the flood-
affected people who are still languishing in makeshift tents. To the much astonishment of common Pakistanis, he, along
with other ordinary officials, started unloading the relief goods with his own hands, and all major newspapers of the
country gave front-page coverage to this picture. This photo conveyed two messages to us: first, the great nations also
have great traditions, and second, relatively small nations, like us, possess low status because our leaders are totally
devoid of such humbleness. The U.S. ambassadors virtually enjoy the viceregal status in third world countries, but
despite enjoying such kingly powers they adopt very humble attitude towards other people. They treat even the
attendants, drivers, and other employees in their personal staff as human beings. And whenever some natural disaster
 visits the populations of the host countries, the U.S. ambassadors in those states rush to help the devastated people.
 Ambassador Cameron Munter could also have behaved like our rulers and distribute relief goods among affected people
 while himself dressed in precious costumes... Even if his attitude was part of the U.S. propaganda, why our rulers cannot
 display such ostentations for the welfare of their subjects? The second message this picture conveyed is that we
 Pakistanis lack humbleness. For our politicians, the ordinary people are nothing more than votes who catapult them into
 the corridors of power. On the other hand, after winning the elections, American politicians live among their people.
 They travel side by side with the common man in public transport and shake hands with them in ordinary restaurants.
 This picture says that until Prime Minister Gilani picks up a flour bag on his shoulders and carries it to a common
 Pakistani, he cannot change the destiny of this nation."
