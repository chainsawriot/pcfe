Subject: Thank you

Dear Kurt,

       Thank you to you and your team for your leadership in setting up today's video conference
with the Secretary.

       Please convey to the Secretary my personal thanks - and the deep gratitude of everyone
here at US Mission NZ - for her generosity with her time and for the graciousness and power of her
words.

        Today's event energized our Mission colleagues, who had been feeling the usual post-crisis
letdown but are now walking on air. The event also had a significant impact on our GNZ friends, who
left the Chancery beaming and commenting among themselves about the extraordinary honor of
being invited into the call as part of our team.

        FYI, immediately upon conclusion of the call we held an awards ceremony to further thank our
Kiwi friends. In front of the full Embassy audience, we called each GNZ attendee forward individually,
shared an anecdote about the person's unique contribution during the immediate aftermath of the
quake, and presented each Kiwi with the American Ambassador's Honor Medal. (Michele Petersen
was previously presented with the Medal, and I believe she has it in her office.)

      Thank you again. Today's video conference was of immense value to everyone here, and I
appreciate the tireless work in DC that made it possible.

           Warm regards,



David Huebner
U.S. Ambassador
