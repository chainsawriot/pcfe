Subject: UN leader urges world to unite and act on Syria (AP)


AUCKLAND, New Zealand - (AP) U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is urging the world community to
take action on Syria.
   While Ban stopped short of calling for military intervention, he delivered some of his strongest statements yet
condemning the violence he says Syrian President Bashar Assad is perpetrating against his people. Ban said it is
time for U.N. members to unite and take "coherent measures."
   Ban told reporters in Auckland on Tuesday that the violence against Syrians has gone on too long. He said
Assad needs to take decisive measures immediately.
   Ban said he last spoke to Assad on Aug. 17 to express alarm about reports of security forces using violence
against civilians.
