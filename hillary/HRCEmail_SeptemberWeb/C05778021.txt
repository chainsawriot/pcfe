FYI - more info below. Press reporting 36 total dead and 2000 injured. Army is manning fixed checkpoints and there are
no police in Cairo. Ambo, as Steve says, thinks we may end up with another violent night and lots more looting.

We just had a quick call with Ambassador Scobey:

•        It was a violent night last night with lots of looting and little police presence throughout most Cairo
neighborhoods (although a small army presence began posting at key points around the city).

•         About 20 Embassy vehicles were destroyed/stolen from the Embassy, though there was no attack
on the Embassy itself. 100% of Embassy staff has been accounted for. DS Mobile Security Detachment
expected to arrive tomorrow.

•           Up to 50,000 were already gathering in Tahrir Square today; Amb. Scobey expects tonight to be just
as bad, if not worse than last night. There continues to be no police presence.

•           New government has not yet been named.

•           Airport is open; traffic is moving throughout the city.

•         While situation throughout Cairo neighborhoods is worrisome, the rest of country and key tourist
sites seems to be calm.

•           Internet and cell phones are back up.

•        Consular Affairs reported 486 calls from Americans expressing concerns about
welfare/whereabouts.

•           Cairo EAC is meeting now, and will consider whether to request ordered/authorized departure.

Our response:

•         U/S Kennedy and M staff are beginning to explore options for charter aircraft to Cairo and then
onward to Frankfurt.

•         We are standing up a task force starting today in the operations center to monitor security situation
and handle growing volume of American citizen calls.

•         We will await Cairo recommendation on authorized/ordered departure in next couple hours.
