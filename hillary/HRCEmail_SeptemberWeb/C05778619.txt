Subject: Pakistan likely to release U.S. diplomat (AP)

WASHINGTON (AP) - Pakistani officials are indicating that a U.S. diplomat charged with murder in Pakistan
may soon be released.
   Raymond Davis works at the U.S. consulate in Lahore. U.S. officials say Pakistan should recognize his
diplomatic immunity. They say he acted in self-defense in shooting and killing two armed men.
   Two Pakistani officials in the United States told The Associated Press they expect Davis to be released in
days, once a Pakistani court goes over documents U.S. officials have submitted to prove Davis' diplomatic
status. The Pakistani officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive diplomatic matter.
