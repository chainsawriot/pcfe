   Dear Hillary:

           I apologize for intruding into your enormously critical, busy and
   pressured schedule. But this is a matter of great personal importance to me and
   hopefully will help prevent clearly avoidable mischief impacting counselor
   employees of the Argentine Republic, and perhaps others. In this instance the
   matter at hand involves my dear friend                                    has for                     B6
   many years served as


           I am not here acting as an attorney but only as F—friend and as an
   interested and concerned citizen.

           Enclosed is a copy of Andrew Bernknopf's letter addressed jointly to
   Ambassador Vilma Martinez at the Embassy of the United States in Argentina
   and The Honorable D. Hector Marcos Timerman, the newly installed Foreign
   Minister of the Argentine Republic. Andrew (and his firm) are among the most
   prestigious tax lawyers in the country and represent

           Here, for your convenience, is a summary of the situation as briefly as I
   can put it:

           1.            is and has been employed by the Foreign Ministry of
   Argentina for some 25 years.
                                                           When he was first
   posted to the United States in 1988                                       , he
   was not a permanent resident of the United States.

           2.       Since 1853 there has been a Treaty of Friendship,
   Commerce and Navigation between Argentina and the United States
   ("Treaty"). Article 11 of the Treaty provides, in pertinent part (and in the
   somewhat arcane language of that time), that:

                      " The Diplomatic Agents and Consuls of the
               Argentine Confederation shall enjoy, in the

               territories of the United States, whatever privileges,
               exemptions and immunities are, or shall be, granted
               to agents of the same rank, belonging to the most
               favored nation; and, in like manner, the Diplomatic
               Agents and Consuls of the United States, in the
               territories of the Argentine Confederation, shall
               enjoy, according to the strictest reciprocity,
               whatever privileges, exemptions and immunities are,
               or may be, granted in the Argentine Confederation
               to the Diplomatic Agents and Consuls of the most
               favored nation."


          3.      Accordingly, pursuant to the Treaty, employees of Consulates of
   Argentina were exempt from tax on their foreign source income - - until now.

            4.       In 1990,       being advised that it would not affect his tax
   situation in this country, applied for and received a green card. His engagement
   by and services for the Argentine Republic were not affected thereby.

           5.     Reasonably and understandably believing that he was exempt
  from federal taxation on his foreign service income,   has not paid United
  States income taxes on such income to date.

            6.     Some time in 2006 the Internal Revenue Agent (stationed in
   Puerto Rico) who evidently has jurisdiction in this area, reversed the position of
   the Internal Revenue Service, which had been unchanged for well over a century.
   His action was taken, despite the IRS letter dated March 27, 1995 (exemption
   confirmed by IRS to Argentine Embassy) and Revenue Ruling 75-4251
   (confirming exemption). Until the recent IRS action, employees of the Argentine
   Consulates acted in reliance on what the Treaty, regulations and law previously
   were understood to provide.

           7.       In March of this year, the State Department issued a certification
   pursuant to IRC §893(a) that American employees at the Embassy and Consulates
   in Argentina and administrative and technical staff were exempt from taxation in
   Argentina so long as they were not permanent residents of Argentina when
   hired. That is the predicate for equal treatment of Argentine employees at the
   Embassy and Consulates of Argentina in the United States. A copy is attached to
   the Bernknopf letter (which also questions whether such a certificate is even
   necessary to effectuate the terms of the Treaty).

   I Copies of IRS letter dated March 27, 1995 and Revenue Ruling 75-425 are attached to
   the Bernknopf letter.

         8.      The tax exposure to          as it may be to other consular
  employees of the Republic of Argentina in America) is horrendous, distressing,
  and could not be foreseen. It is unjust and inappropriate.

          9.       The "easy" cure for this inequity is a bilateral agreement
  between the United States of America and the Republic of Argentina correcting
  and clarifying the situation. We understand that similar agreements have
  recently been entered into between the United States and each of Germany, the
  United Kingdom and Spain.

          In conclusion: we ask that such a bilateral agreement be promptly
  entered into between the United States and Argentina in order to correct this
  horrendous situation, as requested in the Bernknopf letter. I ask for your
  leadership and support of that solution.

            I convey my warmest personal regards. To be clear, I am not writing this
  letter in any way on behalf of any organization, including the American Jewish
  Committee with which, as you may recall, I have long been active.

          My deepest appreciation for your assistance.

          With highest respect and admiration.
