Subject: Officials from India, Pakistan meet in New Delhi (AP)


NEW DELHI - (AP) Top Indian and Pakistani officials are meeting in New Delhi for peace talks against the
backdrop of a recent terror attack that killed 20 people in India's financial capital.
   Tuesdays' meeting between the foreign secretaries of the archrivals is expected to focus on confidence-
building measures, trade and people-to-people exchanges.
   The talks will lay the groundwork for a meeting between the foreign ministers of both nations on Wednesday.
   Peace talks between the nuclear-armed South Asian neighbors broke down over a terrorist attack in Mumbai
in 2008 by 10 Pakistani gunmen.
   The countries decided to restart the peace process in February and have since discussed Kashmir and the
continuing threat of terrorism.
