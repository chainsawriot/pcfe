I don't think the timing is right to do these. We have 0 to say. Let's wait until after the talks and then do informational
calls.

Subject: Hill calls on settlement moratorium

The team believes that some high level strategic targeted Hill calls are needed to explain our position on the settlement
moratorium extension. The thought was:




S calls to Kerry, Berman, Lowey, Feinstein;

Mitchell calls to Levin, Lugar, Leahy.




We would get points to you tomorrow, for calls over the weekend if possible, or Monday.




Does this work?
