Subject: Search for aid workers in Kenya yields vehicle (AP)

   NAIROBI, Kenya - (AP) A police official says Kenyan troops and six helicopters have been deployed to the
Somali border in hopes of finding two Spanish women kidnapped by Somali gunmen. The searchers found their
vehicle was found stuck in the desert.
   Police suspect the gunmen may have forced the women to walk. The police official said Friday that the
hijacked vehicle with two Spaniards from the aid group Doctors Without Borders got stuck about 20 miles (30
kilometers) from the Somali border because of rain and bad terrain. The official said he could not be named.
   The gunmen kidnapped the women from the world's largest refugee camp Thursday. The U.N. has suspended
all non-lifesaving aid operations there following the attack.
