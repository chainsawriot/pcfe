Subject: Afghan attorney general investigating Kabul Bank (AP)

KABUL (AP) - The Afghan attorney general's office says it has launched an investigation into misconduct at
Afghanistan's largest bank, which nearly collapsed in 2010 after a management shake-up and corruption
scandal.


A spokesman for the attorney general's office says the Afghan Central Bank sent a five-page letter to Attorney
General Alako saying certain groups should be investigated for their role in allowing Kabul Bank to fall into
crisis.
