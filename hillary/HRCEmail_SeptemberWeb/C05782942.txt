Subject: Palestinian official denies plans to meet Israelis (Reuters)


RAMALLAH, Oct 13 (Reuters) - A senior Palestinian official denied on Thursday that Palestinian and Israeli
delegates would soon meet in Jordan to discuss restarting peace talks, reiterating demands that Israel stop
building settlements before negotiations can resume.

    Washington and its allies are scrambling to resurrect Israeli-Palestinian peace talks to defuse a diplomatic
crisis after President Mahmoud Abbas submitted a request last month for Palestine to be recognised as a U.N.
member state.

   A U.S. State Department spokeswoman said on Tuesday Washington was hopeful the Israelis and
Palestinians would hold a preliminary meeting in Jordan on Oct. 23.

   But Saeb Erekat, a veteran Palestinian peace negotiator and close advisor to Abbas, told Voice of Palestine
radio that no such meeting was planned.

   "It was said that there are meetings and calls for meetings in Jordan between an Israeli and a Palestinian
delegation with the Quartet. This talk is not true. We did not receive anything from them," he said.

   The Quartet of Middle East peace mediators comprises the United States, the European Union, Russia and
the United Nations. The Quartet issued a statement on Sept. 23 calling on the sides to hold a preliminary
meeting within a month that would lead to full peace talks.

   Erekat said: "My view is that anyone who tries to get around the point that Israel must halt settlement and
accept the '67 borders is only wasting their time," he said.
