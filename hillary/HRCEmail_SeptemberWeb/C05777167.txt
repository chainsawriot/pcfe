          Re:          Clarifying Agreement Respecting Non-Taxation of Consular and Embassy Employees

          Dear Canciller Timerman and Ambassador Martinez:

                       We are United States tax counsel to


                   We represent            in a dispute with the United States Internal Revenue Service (the
          "IRS") that arose out of a new, overreaching IRS tax initiative that conflicts with the letter and
          spirit of the 1853 Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between Argentina and the
          United States (the "1853 Treaty") and that conflicts with longstanding past practice under the
          1853 Treaty.

                  In the interests of fairness and justice for our client and for all Argentine or United States
          consular and embassy employees in a similar position, we respectfully urge you to initiate the
          process for Argentina and the United States to enter into an agreement that clarifies and reaffirms
          that consular and embassy employees of Argentina and the United States are exempt from tax on
          foreign service income in their host country, even if they have obtained permanent resident (or
          "green card") status after their hiring.

                 For your convenience, an Appendix to this letter provides an Executive Summary with
          background on the matter and the need for a clarifying agreement.

              A U.S.-Argentine agreement that reaffirms tax exemption would be consistent with the
      longstanding practice of exemption under the 1853 Treaty, as expressed by the IRS itself in its
      letter dated March 27, 1995 to the Embassy of the Argentine Republic (the "1995 IRS Letter,"
      copy enclosed) and in IRS Revenue Ruling 75-425 (copy enclosed).

              An Argentine-United States agreement also would be consistent with recent bilateral
      efforts of the United States and Spain, Germany and the United Kingdom to preserve the tax
      exemption of their foreign service employees and protect them from potentially devastating tax
      consequences from the IRS' changed position.

              Despite many decades of past practice, a reaffirming agreement between Argentina and
      United States is necessary because the IRS has reversed and narrowed its view and has recently
      decided that Argentine consular and embassy employees who are green card holders do not
      qualify for exemption from United States income tax, unless they rise to a certain level of
      "Diplomatic Agent" or "Consul" (categories whose parameters are uncertain, but is now
      considered by the IRS to include only the very highest levels in the diplomatic service). In our
      view, this reversal is unjustified and does not reflect governing law. In our view, it also violates
      international norms of fairness and due process by undermining valid arid reasonable
      expectations of embassy and consular employees based on previously published IRS guidance.

      I.      Legal Background on the Dispute:

              A.      2006 IRS Initiative Against Foreign Government Employees:

              Our client's dispute arose out of an IRS initiative that was promulgated in 2006 pursuant
      to IRS Announcement 2006-95 purportedly to crack down on foreign government employees
      who did not qualify for the benefits of exemption from United States income tax under United
      States Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") Section 893 or otherwise under an international
      agreement.

             The status of consular and embassy employees, and of green card holders in particular,
      was suddenly thrown into doubt (despite long-held understandings regarding exemption from
      U.S. tax). This upended the reasonable expectations and career and life plans of many people
      working in the interests of amicable international relations.

              B.      IRC Section 893:

                      1.     Three-Part Test for Exemption under Domestic U.S. Tax Law:

              IRC Section 893(a) provides that the wages, fees, or salary of any employee of a foreign
      government or of an international organization (including a consular or other officer, or a
      nondiplomatic representative), received as compensation for official services to such government
      or international organization is exempt from U.S. tax if:

              (1) such employee is not a citizen of the United States,

              (2) in the case of an employee of a foreign government, the services are of a character
      similar to those performed by employees of the government of the United States in foreign
      countries; and

             (3) in the case of an employee of a foreign government, the foreign government grants an
      equivalent exemption to employees of the government of the United States performing similar
      services in such foreign country.

                       2.     Section 893(b) Certification:

              IRC Section 893(b) directs the U.S. State Department to certify to the U.S. Treasury the
      names of the foreign countries which grant an equivalent exemption to the employees of the
      government of the United States performing services in such foreign countries, and the character
      of the services performed by employees of the government of the United States in foreign
      countries (a "Section 893(b) Certification"). Under this directive, the U.S. State Department
      issued a Section 893(b) Certification for Argentina by letter, dated March 23, 2010, to the U.S.
      Treasury Department, and this was transmitted to the Embassy of Argentina by the Secretary of
      State in a diplomatic note dated April 19, 2010. (A copy of the Section 893(b) Certification and
      the transmittal is attached.) 1

              In this Section 893(b) Certification, the U.S. Department of State concluded that
       members of the diplomatic and consular missions of foreign countries in the Argentine Republic
       and foreign national administrative and technical staff personnel of such missions, who, at the
       time they were hired, did not hold Argentine resident status, are exempt from Argentine tax on
       their wages.

              C.       Waiver of Benefits Upon Obtaining Green Card / Treaty Override:

             In accordance with U.S. immigration law, a so-called "Section 247(b)" waiver (codified
      at 8 United States Code 1257(b)) must be executed. Absent an overriding treaty or international
      agreement, this waives the benefits of the tax exemption under IRC Section 893(a) (as well as
      other exemptions from U.S. law).

             Our client, and other consular and embassy employees in this position, reasonably relied
      upon existing U.S. tax law expressed in IRS Revenue Ruling 75-425 that a Section 247(b)
      waiver did not waive the benefits of U.S. tax exemption. Revenue Ruling 75-425, Paragraph 5

       In a recent case, the United States Tax Court decided that Section 893(a) is a self-effectuating provision
      and does not require a Section 893(b) Certification as a prerequisite to the exemption provided by Section
      893(a). Abdel-Fattah v. Conzmisioner, U.S. Tax Court Summary Opinion, 2010 Tax Notes Today 81-9
      (April 27, 2010). It follows from this case that the contents of a Section 893(6) Certification does not
      necessarily dictate the precise parameters of an exemption under Section 893(a)

       provides, in relevant part, that "the alien consular employees of the following countries derive
       exemption from income tax on their official compensation from consular agreements, the filing
       of the [Section 247(b)] waiver does not terminate such exemption: . . . Argentina". The 1995
       IRS Letter confirmed that U.S. tax exemption continued to apply to Argentine consular
       employees who are green card holders. Neither such IRS pronouncement restricts exemption to
       any particular level of employment status.

               However, as a follow-up to the 2006 IRS initiative against foreign government
       employees, in Revenue Ruling 2007-60 (copy attached), the IRS declared Revenue Ruling 75-
       425 to be "obsolete" purportedly because "many of those income tax treaties, consular
       agreements, and international agreements have been modified, superseded, or are no longer, in
       force, and because the facts on which the ruling position was based no longer exist or are not
       sufficiently described to permit clear application of the currently applicable legal provisions and
       agreements." In Revenue Ruling 2007-60, the IRS still acknowledges that individuals employed
       by a foreign government or international organization in the United States, who file a Section
       247(b) waiver "will be entitled to any tax exemption conferred under the provisions of an
       applicable income tax treaty, consular agreement, or international agreement, that is still in force,
       to the extent the application of the exemption is not dependent upon the internal revenue laws of
       the United States." See Treasury Regulations § 1.893-1(c).

               However, Revenue Ruling 2007-60 now obscures the IRS position with respect to a
       particular country from public view and requests that persons who wish to know the status of any
       particular country must contact the IRS by email for their position. Our understanding is that,
       contrary to longstanding views, the IRS now believes that the consular agreement between
       Argentina and the United States (i.e., the 1853 Treaty) does not provide exemption to all
       consular employees but that exemption extends only to the very highest levels of the diplomatic
       and consular services. Even if a limitation of scope of exemption were applied, we believe that
                  Would qualify for U.S. tax exemption because he is                                           B6
                             but our view is not certain to be accepted by the IRS (or by a court).

              This parsimonious view that the exemption provided by the 1853 Treaty does not extend
       to all employees of the consulates and embassy is startling, considering that there has never been
       a change to the 1853 Treaty. This new IRS view is certainly contrary to the spirit of a Treaty of
       "Friendship" and defies common sense interpretation of terminology provided in a document that
       was drafted more than 150 years ago — a time that long predated practices of precise employment
       classifications. We are skeptical that this view of the IRS would be validated by a neutral court
       tribunal, but we are concerned that absent a new reaffirming agreement between Argentina and
       the United States that confirms that the exemption applies to all consular and embassy
       employees (even if they have obtained permanent residence status after their hiring), the IRS will
       continue to take its unjustified and narrowed stance.

               Our understanding is that Spain, Germany and the United Kingdom have taken measures
       to preserve justice for their consular and embassy employees in the face of this overreaching IRS

      initiative by engaging with the United States to preserve tax exemption for their foreign service
      employees. We urge the Argentine Republic and the United States to engage and enter into an
      agreement that confirms tax exemption for all consular and embassy employees.

               D.      The 1853 Treaty:

               Article 11 of the 1853 Treaty provides that:

                       The Diplomatic Agents and Consuls of the Argentine
                       Confederation shall enjoy, in the territories of the United States,
                       whatever privileges, exemptions and immunities are, or shall be,
                       granted to agents of the same rank, belonging to the most favored
                       nation; and, in like manner, the Diplomatic Agents and Consuls of
                       the United States, in the territories of the Argentine Confederation,
                       shall enjoy, according to the strictest reciprocity, whatever
                       privileges, exemptions and immunities are, or may be, granted in
                       the Argentine Confederation to the Diplomatic Agents and Consuls
                       of the most favored nation.

               Under this "most favored nations" clause, the "Diplomatic Agents and Consuls" of
       Argentina are exempt from tax on the wages, salaries and fees with respect to their official
       services. Common sense, historical practice and comparable usage all indicate that "Diplomatic
       Agents and Consuls" must include all consular, diplomatic and embassy employees, since all are
       working in the official service of their country in its diplomatic and consular functions. This
       sensibly inclusive interpretation of this most favored nations clause is also consistent with the
       terminology used in United States tax law in 1RC Section 893, which extends to all "employees"
       of a foreign government with respect to compensation for official services to such government.

       III. Conclusion:

               We respectfully request that the Argentine Republic and the United States of America to
       enter into an agreement to confirm and clarify that:

              (1) the most favored nations provision of the 1853 Treaty provides an exemption from
       United States income tax on compensation for official services of all embassy, consular and
       diplomatic employees of Argentina; and

              (2) this exemption applies to all such employees who are permanent residents
       (notwithstanding their having filed a Section 247(b) waiver).

                         EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

                New, Unjustified IRS Administrative Position Eviscerates Tax Exemption to Argentine
                Consular and Embassy Employees Under 1853 Treaty.

                As part of a recent tax initiative aimed at foreign government employees, the IRS has
                overreached and taken a new, unjustified administrative position that eviscerates the scope of
                the tax exemption conferred to Argentine consular and embassy employees under the 1853
                Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between Argentina and the United States.

                IRS' Reversal of Longstanding and Correct Administrative Position Violates Norms of
                Fairness and Due Process and Undermines Valid Expectations of Consular and Embassy
                Employees.

                In planning their careers and their lives, Argentine consular and embassy employees have
                properly relied on a 1975 IRS Revenue Ruling and a 1995 IRS letter that correctly confirmed
                that they were exempt from U.S. income taxation on foreign service income, even if they had
                obtained U.S. permanent residency after their hiring.

                When the IRS wrongly and unexpectedly narrowed its view of the scope of tax exemption
                under the 1853 Treaty, it violated international norms of fairness and due process. This radical
                departure from past practice by an administrative agency threatens to defeat the valid and
                reasonable expectations of Argentine consular employees.

                Harm Can Be Averted by Entry Into a Confirming Agreement by Argentina and the U.S.

                Potentially devastating financial harm to Argentine consular and embassy employees from this
                radical reversal by the IRS can be averted by Argentina and the U.S. entering into an agreement
                that confirms that (1) consular and embassy employees of each nation at all levels of service are
                exempt from taxation in their host country on their foreign service income and (2) this
                exemption applies even if the employee has obtained permanent resident status in the host
                country after their hiring.

                Argentina and the U.S. Should Join with Other Nations that have Taken Action to Protect
                their Consular and Embassy Employees by Bilateral Agreement.

                Argentina and the U.S. should consider the example set by Spain, German), and the United
                Kingdom, who have engaged bilaterally with the U.S. to protect the rights and expectations of
                foreign service employees as to tax exemption for foreign service compensation.

                A bilateral confirming agreement between Argentina and the U.S. would carry out the law
                created by the 1853 Treaty and would restore the reasonable expectations of consular and
                embassy employees.
