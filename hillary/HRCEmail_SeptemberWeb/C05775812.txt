During the past year we have discussed the size of the Germany PD budget and the fact that it did not reflect current
priorities. EUR reviewed the budget and made the decision to cut the German PD budget by 30% and reallocate the
funding to other areas, primarily Eastern Europe. As you will see from the email below and the attached memo, Mission
Germany responded by reviewing all their PD operations and developing an entirely new approach based on the PD
strategic framework we rolled out earlier this year. I think they did an excellent job and we will be using this as a model
for other Missions as we go forward.




Let me know what you think.

    As you know, PA Germany has taken a huge budget hit. We have lost one-third of our PD funding and, as a result, PD
    LES staffing has been reduced by almost one-third. Dealing with a cut of this magnitude is never easy — it was
    particularly tough last month when we handed out the RIF notices — but we are not wasting time feeling sorry for
    ourselves. We are viewing this as an opportunity, a chance to redefine and restructure our entire PD operation.




    I want to give you a brief update on the progress we have made.

•       We have developed a strategic plan (attached) which we have conveyed to Washington. Rather than just slicing
off pieces of our PD operation, we have focused on our key goals and on how to focus our resources to get maximum
impact in the areas that are most important.




•       We are well advanced in creating a new organizational structure for PA Germany in line with our strategic plan.




•      We are significantly reducing and reshaping our PD LES staffing. We began the process with close to 60 PD LES
throughout Germany. We will end up with 41.




        Now we are looking carefully at all the positions that remain and, wherever necessary, redefining them in line
with the principles laid out in the strategic plan. Our objectives include: emphasis on new media, elimination of stove
piping among the traditional PD elements (e.g. Press, Culture, Information Resource work), and creating the capacity to
form issue-focused "campaign teams." These teams will closely integrate all areas of activity (Press, Culture,
Information Services) and link staff resources Mission-wide.




Our goal is to create a 21st century PD operation that is lean, quick and flexible. We are well on our way to achieving
that goal. Assuming our new funding level remains stable, I am convinced that we will come out of this stronger than
ever.
