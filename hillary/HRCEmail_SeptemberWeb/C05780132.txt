  Hi Cheryl,

 I thought that it might end up not being possible to have the chance to say hello today. Completely understandable. But
 sorry I missed you and I will look forward to whenever I see you in the future.

 I should mention how much I love attending the Women of Courage Awards event. I think it is my favorite event to
 attend each year because it is so inspirational and, for me, energizing. Year after year the women who are celebrated
 are incredibly brave. It is a reminder of
 what the personal stakes are for real people in their own countries.
 And their illumination of unfathomable courage day-to-day distinguishes not only them but also this event in a
 meaningful way from a lot of things that I've attended over the years. So I must say thank you to the people in the State
 Department who let me attend this each year!

 Take care Cheryl!

 Cheers,
 Steve
