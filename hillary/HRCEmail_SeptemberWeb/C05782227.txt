Susan just sent me following:

SA PR called me again after S-Mash call. He said he was hopeful they could lift their hold tomorrow after AU HLP
meeting tomorrow. I said fine if they can, but reinforced we are voting tomorrow if not. In response to his question, I
told him we are putting res in blue after consults today and ready to vote.




Jake pls convey to S my thanks to her for doing the call. It clearly helped.
