 Subject: Thousands rally amid Filipino leader's key report (AP)



 MANILA, Philippines - (AP) Thousands of mostly left-wing protesters have marched in the Philippine
 capital to demand higher wages, farmland and the prosecution of President Benigno Aquino III's predecessor for
 alleged graft ahead of the president's annual state of the nation address.
    Officials say anti-riot police blocked about 3,000 protesters waving red flags and carrying Aquino's effigy to
 prevent them from getting near the House of Representatives, where Aquino is to deliver his speech later
 Monday.
    Protesters say Aquino has not moved fast enough to ease the plight of the poor, workers and farmers.
    Aquino, son of revered democracy icons, won a landslide election victory last year largely due to his clean
 image, family legacy and a promise to battle endemic corruption and poverty.
