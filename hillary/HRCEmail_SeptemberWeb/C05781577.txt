Subject: FW: Adopted!: MONITORING GROUP UNSCR

The UNSC adopted the resolution on Somalia unanimously; now the USG and the UN are in step on assistance
for Somalia.


F is still working on the assistance information you requested this morning; I will send it to you-as soon as I
have it. It looks as though the figure for next week will be higher — close to $100 million. We should consider
how to message this to the world.

Have a great weekend.

Subject: RE: DRAFT MONITORING GROUP RESOLUTION: SILENCE PROCEDURE

Dear Colleagues

Attached is a draft of the resolution we are circulating under silence procedure until 9am Friday morning. We will then,
proceed by putting the draft into blue, and vote on this resolution in the afternoon.

This draft has a couple of amendments after discussions today. These are largely technical so I would sincerely hope that
they are acceptable to all delegations without any further amendment.

        We have enlarged PP3 to include other relevant resolutions
        0P3 has been amended to ensure it is clear that designation is at the discretion of the committee
        0P9 on the humanitarian carve out has been adjusted to broaden the scope of that measure to include NGOs
        responding the UN Consolidated Appeal.

I am very grateful to you all for your patience, and hope this resolution can now be adopted without further delay.

Many thanks
Liz

I have spotted an error! in 0P10 the latter part of a sentence was not fully deleted. I have now amended this in the
draft. A delegation also noted that 0P3 was new language so the use of recalls in this case was not appropriate. I have
amended to use Considers, which is consistent with the previous OP.

Have a good evening

As you may be aware there will be a briefing on the humanitarian situation in Somalia to the Council at 11am on
Monday 25 July. Many experts will need to attend this meeting. Therefore, I have changed the time of the negotiations
to 9am on Mon 25 July to give us sufficient time to consider the whole draft. The location remains the same —

I am hopeful that we will only need one negotiation session on this resolution, given its technical nature.

Dear Colleagues


As you are aware the mandate of the Somalia and Eritrea Monitoring Group expires at the end of the month. Attached is
a draft resolution that we have prepared renewing their mandate for a further 12 months. Much of the resolution
contains standard language (we have tried to cut out unnecessary text from previous years). We have also introduced a
few new elements to the draft, which we hope will be useful and acceptable to everyone.

These include:

     - New designation criteria on violations against children in response to the request made by the SRSG for children,
         and several delegations who approached us bilaterally to support this request

     - Language on the importance of financial propriety

     - Language on the humanitarian situation and the possibility of applying targeted sanctions to those that impede
         humanitarian aid efforts, given the current drought

     - Language on Al Shabaab ports

I realise all African experts are extremely busy at the moment given the various resolutions that need to be completed
by next Friday! I have scheduled an experts meeting at 10am on Monday 25 July. I will send,an email confirming the
location tomorrow. Given that this is a very technical text I hope this should be a relatively short negotiation process.

Many thanks to everyone for their cooperation in advance.
Liz
