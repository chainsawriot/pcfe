Subject: International Strategy

I thought the roll out — and particularly the Secretary's remarks — went very well. It's generating some good buzz both in
the press and among the relevant diplomatic corp. It was great that the Secretary was out in front on this. As one
blogger noted: "the choice of State and Secretary Clinton to present the strategy is encouraging, giving ownership to the
most visible arm of administration Internet policy and situating coordination under one roof..."

The next challenge is cementing the Department's leadership role in implementing the Strategy. We are working closely
with PA to amplify both the Strategy and the Secretary's leadership, following up with posts on the cable we sent on
Friday, reaching out to key foreign counterparts, and working to convene appropriate groups of stakeholders — including
embassy representatives, the private sector and NGOs — on the way ahead. I will keep you apprised of these activities as
we move forward and, as always, I welcome any thoughts you have on how we can be most effective.
Thanks.

Chris
