Subject: Israel, Egypt to preserve peace deal-Netanyahu aide (Reuters)

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel and Egypt are working to preserve the landmark peace accord they signed in
1979, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman said on Saturday after rioting forced the evacuation of
Israel's Cairo embassy.

   "There is a new Egyptian administration with which are fully and painstakingly coordinating. And it is the
intent of this Egyptian administration, as it is that of the government of Israel, to preserve the peace that has
been preserved for more than 30 years," spokesman Roni Sofer told Israel's Army Radio.
