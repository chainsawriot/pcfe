Subject: Possible call to Mexican FM Espinosa

Madame Secretary,

Bill Burns just called for you to say that if you could make the phone call to FM Espinosa this evening, he thinks it would
be a good idea.

Bill is following up with Alice to make sure you have the most current info for the call, if you choose to make it.
