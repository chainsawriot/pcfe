Subject: Yemeni troops, tribal fighters clash in capital (AP)


SANAA (AP) - Government forces and supporters of Yemen's most powerful tribe have clashed for a second
consecutive day in the capital despite efforts to mediate an end to the fighting.
   Witnesses say heavy gunfire erupted Saturday in Sanaa's Hassaba district between forces loyal to President
Ali Abdullah Saleh and the al-Ahmar. The violence broke an overnight lull after similar clashes on Friday.
   Supporters of the ailing president and those loyal to the al-Ahmar clan have been locked in a tense standoff
since late May when al-Ahmar's leader sided with the mass protests calling for Saleh's ouster. That igniting a
round of fighting that threatened to escalate into all-out war.
   Government and diplomatic mediation to restore the fragile cease-fire appeared to be ignored.
