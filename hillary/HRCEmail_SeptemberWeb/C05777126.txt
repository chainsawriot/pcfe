Subject: Haiti Industrial Park supported by USG investment

Dear Madame Chairwoman:

I am so pleased you are considering traveling to Haiti to participate in the signing of the largest private
investment and jobs creation event in their recent history. Through the efforts of our Congress, including
passing the first and second HOPE Acts, the garment industry in Haiti saw a revival in 2009 that resulted in a
total of 25,000 full-time jobs in the apparel sector. At that time, the garment industry accounted for two thirds

of Haiti's exports and about 10% of the GDP. Then the earthquake struck. What is little known is that the
garment industry has brought more than 4,000 jobs to Haiti since April 2010. This growth has been largely
driven by the efforts of Congress to increase trade preference levels through the Haiti Economic Lift Program
(HELP).

Following on this momentum, on Tuesday the United States Government will participate in closing a historic
deal, that originated with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding by Secretary Clinton, with Sae-A,
one of the world's largest garment manufacturers, the IDB, and the Government of Haiti to create an industrial
park in the Northern Corridor. The park will create at least 20,000 full-time jobs, and in support of the park, the
USG's contributions will provide for 5,000 new homes, a new power plant to service the park and surrounding
areas that lack access to electricity, as well as upgrading the transportation infrastructure, including the port.

Sae-A will become the country's largest private employer, estimated to bring $500 million in wages and
benefits to Haiti over the course of ten years, and almost double the size of the country's garment
industry. Moreover, as a leading brand, Sae-A's decision will not only put Haiti in the spotlight of major
apparel buyers, but also other investors that have regarded investment in Haiti as risky.

This park will be good for Haiti, but also good for US businesses that source goods from Haiti; it also will be
good for Florida which, through port investments the USG will be making in the North of Haiti, will bring us
our two markets even closer.

The event is being put together as I write. President Clinton and Prime Minister Bellerive will preside. The
Chairman of Sae-A is flying in from Korea and the IDB will be represented. The event will be mid-day on
Tuesday at a Haitian apparel job training center that is supported by the USG through USAID.

I would welcome you traveling with me or assisting in arranging for you to travel mil-air on Tuesday to
participate.

Please let me know how I can help facilitate your attendance!

Best.
