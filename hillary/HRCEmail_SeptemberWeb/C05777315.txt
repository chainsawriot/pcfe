Sorry:



    - UNSCR 1392 (2002) called on both parties to cooperate in the implementation of the Tenet Work Plan and the
        Mitchell recommendations. The Mitchell report called for Israel to freeze all settlement activity, including
          natural growth. So this predates the Roadmap and do not think the parties were on board.
