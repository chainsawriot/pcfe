Subject: Libyan opposition to meet at White House Friday (AP)

WASHINGTON (AP) - The Obama administration is inviting representatives of Libya's opposition group to the
White House Friday.
  The White House says Mahrnoud Jibril and a delegation from the Libyan Transitional National Council will
meet with National Security Adviser Tom Donilon and members of Congress. A meeting with President Barack
Obama didn't appear to be part of the delegation's schedule.
  Jibril is the president of the Council, which opposes longtime Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. Jibril met
with Sen. John Kerry this week. Kerry says he is writing legislation at the request of the White House to free up
some of Gadhafi's frozen assets for use by the opposition forces.
  Jibril has said he wants to convey to Americans the group's dream of building a democratic Libya.
