Rubio statement re negotiations around Alan Gross. In expressing his frustration, he alludes that he'll take it out on
Roberta during the confirmation process.
Operative language below:

"It's deplorable that the U.S. government offered several unilateral concessions to the Castro regime in exchange for the
release of a man who was wrongfully jailed in the first place. Rather than easing sanctions in response to hostage taking,
the U.S. should put more punitive measures on the Castro regime.

"Until Secretary Clinton answers for this, the nomination of Roberta Jacobson to be the next assistant secretary of state
for the western hemisphere will be in question."

      SENATOR RUBIO STATEMENT ON ADMINISTRATION'S
        PROPOSED PRISONER EXCHANGE WITH CUBA
Washington, D.C. — U.S. Senator Marco Rubio issued the following statement regarding the Obama
Administration's attempts to negotiate the release of an American contractor held in Cuba in exchange for
releasing a convicted Cuban spy and easing sanctions:

"It's deplorable that the U.S. government offered several unilateral concessions to the Castro regime in
exchange for the release of a man who was wrongfully jailed in the first place. Rather than easing sanctions in
response to hostage taking, the U.S. should put more punitive measures on the Castro regime.

"Until Secretary Clinton answers for this, the nomination of Roberta Jacobson to be the next assistant
secretary of state for the western hemisphere will be in question."
