Subject: Egypt mobile phone network resumes in capital (Reuters)

CAIRO (Reuters) - Mobile phone services started to resume across the Egyptian capital on Saturday, after being
shut down a day earlier during unprecedented demonstrations calling for President Hosni Mubaralc to step
down.

Telecoms operator Vodafone said it and other mobile operators had no option but to comply with an order from
the Egyptian authorities to suspend services in selected areas of the country

The move was heavily criticised by rights groups.

"We would like to make it clear that the authorities in Egypt have the technical capability to close our network,
and if they had done so it would have taken much longer to restore services to our customers," a Vodafone
spokesman said.

"It has been clear to us that there were no legal or practical options open to Vodafone or any of the mobile
operators in Egypt but to comply with the demands of the authorities," the spokesman said in a statement.
