Rebecca, let's hope the Boston Globe/AP article gets legs. Since it is from AP we should be in good
shape. Real fans will remember the problems with overage players in the past. Have a good
weekend. David

Here are some quick clips to give you an idea of how this is progressing. The New York Times is calling
for comment now for a story to run tomorrow.

Ugandan League Rep Says Team Visas Denied Over Age
Boston Globe (Associated Press reporting by Genaro Armas)

A representative for the league affiliated with a youth baseball team from Uganda tells The
Associated Press that players were denied visas to play in the Little League World Series because of
discrepancies over their ages and birth dates. Stanley says issues arose when birth dates listed on
documentation didn't match ones offered by parents or guardians during interviews with U.S. visa
officials. A State Department spokesman says it's policy to not discuss visa cases publicly.

State Department spokesman Mark Toner said today at his daily news briefing that denying the visas
was "a very difficult situation, but our consular officials are committed to holding up U.S. law." He said
he couldn't discuss individual cases. "I can assure you that consular officers examined each of these
individuals and accorded them every consideration under the law," Toner said. Toner said each
player's application was examined individually and they were each interviewed. He said he didn't
believe that consulate officials were concerned the Ugandan players would try to stay after their
visas expired.
