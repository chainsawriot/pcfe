RAMALLAH (AP) - A senior Palestinian Authority official has accused the Gulf state of Qatar of using its Al-Jazeera TV
channel to undermine the West Bank's Palestinian leadership with a news report about Mideast peace talks. Al-Jazeera
aired late January 23 what it said were leaked documents showing the Palestinians agreed to deep concessions on two
of the thorniest issues in negotiations with Israel: Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees. Yasser Abed Rabbo,
secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said the news network engaged in "media games ... to trick
and mislead the simple citizen." Abed Rabbo says the report relied on out-of-context quotes and fabrications. But he
remained vague in disputing some of the show's specific claims.
