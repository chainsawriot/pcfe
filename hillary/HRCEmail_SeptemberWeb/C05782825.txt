Subject: Anti-Gadhafi fighters celebrate gains in Libya (AP)


SIRTE (AP) - Jubilant revolutionary forces have raised their tri-color flag over a convention center in Side that
long served as a base for Moammar Qadhafi's loyalists, even as fighting rages elsewhere in the fugitive leader's
hometown.
   Col. Younis al-Abdally, a commander in Sirte, says his troops have surrounded pro-Gadhafi fighters in a
small area in the upscale neighborhood of Dollar Street.
   The statement comes after days of fierce battles, with tank, rocket and machine-gun fire echoing through the
streets around the Ouagadougou Convention Center, an ornate complex that Qadhafi frequently used for
international summits.
   Libya's new rulers have said they expect Side to fall this week, but die-hard supporters of the longtime leader
are putting up a fierce resistance.
