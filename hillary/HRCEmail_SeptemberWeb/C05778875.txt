Subject: Defense Minister: Israel must move ahead toward peace (AP)

UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Minister: Israel must move ahead toward peace and try to promote stability with all
its neighbors despite the turbulence in the region.
   Ehud Barak said there are risks in failing to move forward with the peace process.
   He spoke to reporters after meeting U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon late Thursday, just minutes after
Egyptian President Hosni Mubaralc announced he would remain president but was handing power to his vice
president.
   Barak said he would not respond to what is happening in Egypt, saying it is up to the Egyptian people to find
a way to make changes according to their constitution, norms and practices.
