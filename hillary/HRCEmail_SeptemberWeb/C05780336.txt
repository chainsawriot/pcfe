Subject: Tunisian protesters urge Saudi to extradite Ben All (Reuters)


TUNIS (Reuters) - Hundreds of Tunisians rallied outside the Saudi embassy on Friday demanding the
extradition of former president Zine al-Abidine Ben All and staging a mock trial that sentenced the former
strongman to death.

  Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia after he was ousted by mass protests on Jan. 14 after 23 years in power. Several
members of his family and some of his closest allies were detained shortly after he was forced out.
