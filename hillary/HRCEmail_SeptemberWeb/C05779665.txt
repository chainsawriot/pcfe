Subject: Paris ponders evacuation of French from Ivory Coast (Reuters)


PARIS, April 3 (Reuters) - France is mulling a possible evacuation of its 12,000 citizens from Ivory Coast,
French defence minister Gerard Longuet said on Sunday, as fighting between rival groups intensified in the
African cocoa producer.

   "This is a question which is being asked and which will be settled in the next few hours," Longuet said in an
interview on French television LCI.

   Battles continued at the weekend between forces loyal to incumbent Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo
and those of his rival, president claimant Alassane Outtara.

    Ggabgo is refusing to cede power after losing a U.N. certified election to Outtara.

   "We will not expose French people to being hostages or indirect victims of confrontation between these two
forces," Longuet said.
