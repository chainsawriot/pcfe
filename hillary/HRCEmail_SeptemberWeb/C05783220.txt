Dear Secretary Clinton,

On behalf of Walmart, I want to thank you for your leadership on the empowerment of women and girls. You have brought
focus to this issue within the international community and paved the way for economic empowerment initiatives like ours
to make a difference in the lives of millions of women and their families.

I sincerely appreciate your taking the time to meet with our executives at the APEC summit and your kind words about our
initiative. I am grateful for your support and partnership.

There is a new energy behind women's empowerment as a result of your advocacy, and the world is beginning to
understand that governments and businesses must work together to give women the opportunities they need and
deserve. I believe we can use Walmart's size and scale, our supply chain, and our strategic partnerships to help women
live better, just as we have made a positive difference through our work on sustainability, hunger and healthier foods.

Thank you again for your time and partnership, and I look forward to continuing our collaboration.

Sincerely,

Mike Duke
President & CEO, Walmart
