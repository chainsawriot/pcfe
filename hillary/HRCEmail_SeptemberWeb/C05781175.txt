Subject: Germany loaning $144 million to Libyan rebels (AP)

BERLIN (AP)     - Germany says it is loaning Libya's rebel leadership (EUR0)100 million ($143 million) to help
with the country's rebuilding and humanitarian needs.
    The Foreign Ministry said Sunday it is granting urgently needed funding as a loan because frozen assets of
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi cannot yet be released.
    Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle announced last month that Germany was recognizing the rebels'
National Transitional Council as Libya's legitimate representative.
    Westerwelle says the situation is difficult because of lack of funding "to build up the necessary structures and
overcome supply shortages."
    He says the money will be paid back from frozen Gadhafi assets once the U.N. Security Council has released
it to Libya's new government. Germany has said it froze "several billion" euros (dollars).
