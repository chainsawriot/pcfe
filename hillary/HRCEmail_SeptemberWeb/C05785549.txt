Thank you! I think the Dialogue went well, and in no small part due to the fantastic round the clock work from the entire
S&ED team. I also must say - the narrative of points you raised with Dai in the second small group meeting was truly
remarkable! Everyone was marveling at it afterwards.

Next up - India Strategic Dialogue!

Many thanks,
Mike

Dear Mike---

I thought I'd see you at the S&ED photo, but since it's been postponed,
I didn't want any more time to pass before thanking you for all that you
did to make this year's Dialogue so smooth and successful. Great job!

See you at the photo (sometime). All the best, H
