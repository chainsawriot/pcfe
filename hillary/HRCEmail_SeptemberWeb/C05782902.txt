Subject: Message for Hillary.

HI Huma,
Hope all is well with you. Darius and I are in the US for a month. Would appreciate if you could forward this to Hillary.
Many thanks. Spenta

Dear Hillary,
I have just arrived in NYC,
                                                                                           Thank you. That was SO
thoughtful of you to do that.




            in It there is a chance to meet up even briefly either in DC or NYC, that would be great. Of course I could
come down to DC any other time too, as I am pretty foot loose and fancy free this trip.

The Pakistan-US relationship is certainly facing some major challenges, but I am hopeful that with some clear thinking,
honest intentions and good diplomacy many of these challenges can be resolved. What did you think of our new foreign
minister? I sure hope that the conversations behind the scenes are more positive than what is going on in the public
arena both in the US and Pakistan.

With love and best wishes,
Spenta
