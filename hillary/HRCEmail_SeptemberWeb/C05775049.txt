I know that Jack gave you a verbal summary, but here is the blow by blow. Not a wonderful meeting. To me the biggest
issue concerns the role of the NSC versus State/USAID in coordinating development policy. I will send some thoughts on
a possible strategy tomorrow. Jake, Cheryl and Jack have all seen this summary and Jack has approved it. AM
