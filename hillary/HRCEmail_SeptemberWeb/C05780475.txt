Subject: RE: Saudi Prince Khalid bin Abdullah dies (AP)

Hi, Alice. This appears to be a case of mistaken identity. The Saudi Press Agency reported yesterday
that Prince Khalid bin Abdullah bin Saud al-Saud (the grandson of former King Saud and NOT/NOT a
son of King Abdullah) had died over the weekend
(http://www.spa.gov.sa/english/details.php?id=901305). According to the report, Prince Sattam led
funeral prayers on Friday.

We have little information re. Prince Khalid aside from his having had some business interests and not
appearing to have been involved in government or politics; his two brothers were air force pilots. We
understand he was not close to the King, and we are not planning to send a condolence letter.

Regards,
Glen Keiser, acting DCM
