I did get your response right away and reached out to ops but there was a miscommunication. I called back into ops and
they said that they will build the call for you.

Ops just told me they hadn't heard from me that I could take the call at 11:05. Monica--did you not get my response
sent below? I'm worried about continuing BB problems.
