H: This may be worthless meandering on my part, but if the US unveils its own position in the new negotiations,
inevitable if they are not to collapse, perhaps that position should incorporate at its heart what the Israeli government
has already agreed to in the final status negotiations at Camp David, along, of course, with certain adjustments and
amendments to account for the past ten years in terms of boundaries, etc. This puts the burden on Bibi to repudiate
Barak in principles and details if he pushes back, splitting his coalition, and appearing to be the rejectionist. Also it makes
the US seems utterly reasonable, for the Israelis have already agreed to the core of these positions and arguments
cannot be made that they would undermine security, etc. Furthermore, three-quarters at least of US Jews supported the
Camp David peace effort. S
