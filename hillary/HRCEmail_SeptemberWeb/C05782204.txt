Sen. John Cornyn told reporters Tuesday that not selling Taiwan F-16s would send the wrong

message to U.S. allies and could cost 2,300 jobs at the Lockheed Martin factory in Texas that makes

them.


He said Congress may still be able to amend the defense authorization bill to meet Taiwan's request.
