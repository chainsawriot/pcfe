The COM conference was lust fabulous and the Secretary so darn impressive - by FAR the standout
star of the week.


I found the reports and follow up conversations from the breakout sessions extremely useful. And who
could not love the presentation on "purpose"? If someone videoed him at the conference, I would
love a copy to share with my staff. And the White House - fires blazing, band playing, champagne
flowing AND AND AND the President himself taking individual pictures. You would have to be a lot
older and a lot more jaded than me not to have been impressed! And I was. But I thought the
shining hour came with the SS answering questions from the audience - so professional and
competent. I am so proud to work for her.

So THANK YOU - for everything.
