Subject: Pakistan to launch operation in N. Waziristan-report (Reuters)

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan has decided to launch a "targeted military offensive" in North Waziristan,
the main sanctuary for al Qaeda and Taliban on the border with Afghanistan, a newspaper reported on May
30.

  The United States has long demanded that Pakistan launch an offensive in the region to hunt down the
Haqqani network, one of the deadliest Afghan factions fighting American troops in Afghanistan.

   Pakistan has been reluctant, but has come under intense U.S. pressure to attack militancy after it was
discovered that Osama bin Laden had been living in Pakistan.

  The local News newspaper quoted unnamed "highly placed sources" as saying Pakistani airforce planes
would soften up militant targets under the offensive before ground operations were launched.
