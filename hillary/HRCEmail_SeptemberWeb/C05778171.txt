Re: Wikileaks



The Wikileaks documents can be cast as reflecting a positive light on the U.S. government and diplomacy. Your
statement about how the documents underscored the Iranian nuclear threat is headed in the right direction.

1. The Wikileaks disclosure is the opposite of the Pentagon Papers. The Pentagon Papers provided evidence from an
internal study conducted by the Department of Defense that the U.S. administration was not telling the truth about the
Vietnam War. On the contrary, the Wikileaks papers prove that the U.S. government today has been telling the truth
about the threats we face in the world. Our government is telling the truth.
2. The Wikileaks papers prove that American diplomats are hard at work at the difficult, often frustrating job of
protecting and advancing our interests in the world. These documents are testimony to the diligence, intelligence and
clear mindedness of our diplomats. Our diplomats are doing their work on the frontlines of national security.
