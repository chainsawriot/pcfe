I returned Delahunt call about AGR. He is strongly opposed and wanted to know our position. Told him S opposed. He
said his "sense" was that Berman and others expected calls from admin asking them to stand down. He was unsure if it
would come to a vote but promised to call me if he was hearing it would.
