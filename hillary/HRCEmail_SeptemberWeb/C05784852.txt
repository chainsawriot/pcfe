Subject: France's Lagarde formally announces IMF bid (AP)


PARIS (AP) -.French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde has announced she will seek the top job at the
International Monetary Fund.
  Many European countries, including Germany and Britain, have offered their backing to a candidacy by
Lagarde to run the IMF, which provides billions in loans to shore up the world economy.
  Lagarde had been silent about her intentions until Wednesday, when she announced at a press conference that
she wants the job.
