Even for Haiti. When          hinted lnite would indeed come close, I told him, as instructed this would be problematic,
and would probably lead to proportionate consequences, he hinted that it was the quid pro quo, so to speak, for losing the
presidency. The brazenness of engineering such a coup seemed unbelievable to me at the time!

As feared, the CEP, using the contestations, gave lnite an absolute majority of the Chamber of Deputies, with 52 or 53
seats of the 99-member body (to be ascertained in the morning):

Flagrant reversals from the preliminary results include a Centre Department Senate candidate, Delacruz Francisco of the
opposition party Alternative, who had placed 1st with 34,622 votes, but somehow lost to the third place Inite candidate
Francois Bazelais, who garnered 20,920 votes (the Centre Department had 2 open Senate seats). lnite thus controls the
Senate with 18 Senators of the 30 (to be confirmed in the morning).

As for the Chamber of Deputies, likewise, the CEP overturned two alternative candidates' victories in favor of mite
contenders.

          has not returned calls.                                                                                            B1

rResultsave not yet been announced; it is unclear if the CEP will bow to pressure/payments. Pierre did speak with
        earlier and he claimed very few changes would occur.                                                              B1

Sorry!

I am saying they faced pressure, on the one hand, to maintain the preliminaries; on the other hand, to overturn some
prelimanary results, mostly in the Chamber of Deputies, to increase mites numbers. The latter outcome would increase
mite's bargaining power in negotiations with president-elect Martelly in the make-up of the new government, chiefly the
choice of a PM.

Hope this clears it.

 Too short-hand â€”are you saying they are overturning things to give INITE a bigger victor in one of the
 houses?

CEP members are discussing the results prior to announcement. Delay due to pressure by opposition candidates and
political parties I) to confirm preliminary results; and 2) mite to overturn some preliminary results to favor its candidates.

Stay tuned.

Subject: Second Elections Round Definitive Results

Dear colleagues,

As instructed, I discussed the definitive second round results with         I stressed that the                                  B1
USG hoped that the definitive results would reflect the will of the majon   voters, and that it                                  1.4(D)
would be problematic if the CEP changed any results due to political pressure whether from the
ruling or opposition political parties.

His reaction:

    1. Of the 68 contestations lodged by losing candidates, most, if not all of the preliminary results
       would not change, despite heavy pressure from ruling party leaders to overturn some of them
       to ensure a majority, particularly in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies (COD) - the
       ruling party won 33 CoD seats, and would need 17 for an absolute majority;                    B1
                                                                                                     1.4(D)
    2. Though the CEP will publish the results later this evening,            claimed he had not seen
       some of the rulings ; nevertheless, he would ensure that where the tribunal ruled to overturn
       preliminary results, this was done in strict compliance with the law. Accordingly, he will keep
       Post informed of the outcome of the contested results prior to the announcement;

    3. CEP members are aware of the apprehension of candidates and political parties, and is
       committed to an outcome that respects the letter and spirit of the Electoral Law.

Many cheers!
