Subject: Secret papers reveal slow death of Middle East peace process (The Guardian)

The biggest leak of confidential documents in the history of the Middle East conflict has revealed that
Palestinian negotiators secretly agreed to accept Israel's annexation of all but one of the settlements built
illegally in occupied East Jerusalem. This unprecedented proposal was one of a string of concessions that will
cause shockwaves among Palestinians and in the wider Arab world.

A cache of thousands of pages of confidential Palestinian records covering more than a decade of negotiations
with Israel and the United States has been obtained by al-Jazeera TV and shared exclusively with the Guardian.
The papers provide an extraordinary and vivid insight into the disintegration of the 20-year peace process,
which is now regarded as all but dead.

The documents — many of which will be published by the Guardian over the coming days — also reveal:

• The scale of confidential concessions offered by Palestinian negotiators, including on the highly sensitive
issue of the right of return of Palestinian refugees.

• How Israeli leaders privately asked for some Arab citizens to be transferred to a new Palestinian state.

• The intimate level of covert co-operation between Israeli security forces and the Palestinian Authority.

• The central role of British intelligence in drawing up a secret plan to crush Hamas in the Palestinian
territories.

• How Palestinian Authority (PA) leaders were privately tipped off about Israel's 2008-9 war in Gaza.
