Subject: Re: Lett you a vox on your cell

Cheryl,
         Thank you very much. That is great news. Indications from the Ecumenical Patriarch also suggest that
this subject may possibly be ready to improve but your reading gives us more hope. It is amazing what the
Secretary has done for the head of the second largest Christian Church in the world. From getting the first
sitting President in history to visit the Ecumenical Patriarch to these incredible developments now, it is
incredible. Thank you very much.
                                                                                            Andy
PS Sorry that for some reason my cell phone has not rung when you have called.
            If! can find 5 minutes on your schedule there is something important I would like to mention to you
personally.
