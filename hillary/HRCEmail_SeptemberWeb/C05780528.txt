Subject: Hundreds of thousands demonstrate in Yemen (AP)


SANAA (AP) - Hundreds of thousands are holding rallies across Yemen to protest against the killing of dozens
of anti-government demonstrators during a two-month-old uprising.
   About 100,000 marched Saturday in the city of Taiz, were four protesters were killed and about 400 injured
Friday. Protesters blamed the local governor, chief of security and leader of the ruling party for the deaths.
   More than 120 people have been killed since protests against Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, began
Feb. 11.
   Meanwhile, tensions are rising between Yemen and Qatar, and Yemen recalled its ambassador to the Gulf
nation. Qatar is a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council which has proposed Saleh hand power to his deputy
in return for immunity from prosecution.
