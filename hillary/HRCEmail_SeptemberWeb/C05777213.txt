STATEMENT FROM LISA MCGOVERN:




"Earlier today, Jim underwent successful surgery in Washington to remove his thyroid gland. During a recent routine
examination, we discovered a small nodule that a biopsy showed to be cancerous. This type of thyroid cancer grows
very slowly, and is successfully treatable. He's feeling good, and his prognosis is excellent. Jim will take a few days off
and is looking forward to being back at work next week for the lame-duck session. Until then, I'll be trying to convince
him to rest and stay off the phone!

"As Executive Director of the Congressional Families program at the Prevent Cancer Foundation, I know how important
early detection and treatment can be. Jim and I urge everyone to get their regular check-ups and screenings, and to
take steps to prevent cancer by making healthy lifestyle choices, which include a good diet, exercise, not smoking and
knowing your family history and risk factors. Lots of good information can be found at www.preventcancer.org."




The following is a statement from Dr. Brian P. Monahan, the Congressional Attending Physician:




"Congressman McGovern was admitted to the Washington Hospital Center today for surgery to remove the thyroid
gland in his neck. He was discovered to have a nodule in his thyroid gland on routine health examination. A biopsy of
this nodule showed papillary cancer of the thyroid gland. He underwent today's procedure to remove the gland from
his neck as a curative therapy for his cancer. He completed the surgery without complications and will be discharged
from the hospital after a brief period of observation.




"Thyroid cancer is diagnosed in about 37,000 people in the United States each year with over 75% of these being the
papillary type. The vast majority of patients are cured with surgery and do not experience any further issues with the
disease. Further tests and therapies will be determined after study of the thyroid gland removed at surgery, and
Congressman McGovern will take a daily thyroid medication to replace the functions of his thyroid gland. He will return
to his usual duties next week after a brief convalescence."
