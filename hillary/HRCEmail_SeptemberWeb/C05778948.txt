Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat resigns

Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat, who led several rounds of peace talks with Israel
has told the BBC he has handed in his resignation.

He has previously said he would quit if it emerged that confidential files recently leaked on the
Middle East peace process, came from his office.

Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas has yet to accept; it is not the first time Mr Erekat has
offered to stand down.

Meanwhile, an Abbas aide said elections would be held by September
