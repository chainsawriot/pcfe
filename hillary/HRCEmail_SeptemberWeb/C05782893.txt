Subject: Mubarak can be moved to prison hospital-prosecutor (Reuters)


CAIRO, April 24 (Reuters) - Egypt's public prosecutor said on Sunday that a doctor declared ousted President
Hosni Mubarak well enough to be transferred to a prison hospital in Cairo pending questioning over corruption
and murder allegations.

   "The public prosecutor has ordered the Interior Ministry to transfer former President Hosni Mubarak to
Mazra'a hospital in Torah prison (in Cairo)" once the hospital is ready to receive him, the prosecutor said in a
statement.

   Mubarak took refuge in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh after a popular uprising ended his 30-year
rule.

   He was admitted to a hospital there with an unspecified illness the day that prosecutors ordered him detained
for questioning.
