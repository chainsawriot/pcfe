Good news. 1MB just called me to confirm that they were going to put all but the 18 contested races into the Moniteur
and that they would seek to sit the parliament minus the 18 as soon as possible. He explained that there was a review
now going on regarding the 18 races and he hoped to have some kind of explanation, perhaps as early as today, but in
any case quite soon. I said this was a good development and said we would be eager to see what the review turns up.
