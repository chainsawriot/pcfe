Following up on your great recommendation during the cultural working group debrief to notify Members of Congress
when we send their constituents on our cultural programs, we have implemented a correspondence system to notify
Members upon the return of their constituents. Each week, we will review our cultural program participant list and send
letters accordingly. The basic letter template which will be personalized as needed (see attached for an example) has
been cleared by H and R to expedite the process. We will also periodically review how many participants we have from
each state and send letters to Senators as appropriate.




Today, we sent our first batch of letters out to:

Congressman Robert Brady (D-PA1)

Congresswoman Yvette Clarke (D-NY11)

Congressman Eliot Engel (D-NY17)

Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton (0-DC)

Congresswoman Sheila Jackson-Lee (D-TX18)

Congressman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY8)

Congressman John Diver (D-MA)

Congressman Charlie Rangel (D-NY15)

Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA27)




If this process proves as successful as we think it will, we can work towards broadening it to our other programs as well.
It's a great idea and a wonderful way to share all that we are doing with those who might not even know they are
benefiting!
