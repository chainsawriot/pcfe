Subject:                         Happy New year! And some questions



Judith--

  Happy New Year to you and your family and thank you for making this journey w me. I'm looking forward to the work
ahead in 2010.

 A few odds and ends--

  Have you heard of the Ben Franklin awards for public diplomacy? I saw a reference to them and don't know what they
are.

  Have you connected w Georgetown Prof and former Amb Cynthia Schneider? She has written and worked on cultural
engagement in the Muslim world and wants to help.

                                                                                                              If so,
when would you be ready to do it?
