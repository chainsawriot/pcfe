Anne-Marie

Hillary Clinton gave a speech at the American Task Force on Palestine on October 20th. Her speech was the best speech
that any US Secretary of State has given on the Palestine question. What made her speech different was her emphasis
on two concepts that resonate with Arabs and Moslems mirroring justice and dignity. Her speech was well received and
several Arab commentators wrote positively about what she said.
