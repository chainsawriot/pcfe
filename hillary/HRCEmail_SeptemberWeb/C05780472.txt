Subject: Hamas rejects Fayyad as next Palestinian PM (AP)

 GAZA CITY (AP) - Hamas has rejected the rival Fatah movement's nominee to head a transitional Palestinian
government, complicating plans to unify the dueling factions ruling the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
  Hamas' objection could also compromise foreign support for the Palestinian Authority.
  Fatah has nominated Salam Fayyad, the prime minister of the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, to
head the caretaker government.
  Fayyad, a U.S.-educated economist, enjoys the respect of foreign donors. His reappointment would ease
Western concerns that donor money would fall into the hands of Hamas, which the West considers a terror
organization.
  Hamas official Salah Bardawil told The Associated Press on Sunday that "Hamas will not agree to grant
Salam Fayyad the confidence to run the national unity government."
