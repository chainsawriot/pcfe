Subject: Obama, with Netanyahu: Peace cannot be imposed (AP)

UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu is thanking President Barack Obama for endorsing direct talks with Palestinians and speaking out
against any United Nations bid to declare a Palestinian state on its own.
  With Obama at his side, Netanyahu said September 21 the Palestinian bid to appeal directly to the U.N. is a
short cut that "will not succeed."
  He was echoing an appeal that Obama had made moments earlier to world leaders gathered at the U.N.
General Assembly. Netanyahu lauded Obama for speaking up on principle.
  Obama and Netanyahu spoke at the start of a meeting the two leaders had on the sidelines of the U.N session.
  Obama reiterated that peace cannot be imposed on the parties and that they must negotiate.
