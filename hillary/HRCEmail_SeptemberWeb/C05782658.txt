Jakeâ€”Wanted to run something by you. Was told the Secretary was pretty blunt with Davutoglu that the US wouldn't sit
back as Turkish warships enter Cypriot waters and harass Americans working for a U.S. energy company, Noble
Energy. Made it clear that the safety of Americans citizens was at stake.

Does that sound right to you? Seems like this Cypriot crisis hasn't abated. Turkish ships are still operating illegally inside
Cypriot waters and conducting military maneuvers around 60 kilometers from Nobel's drilling platforms.

Want to make sure I'm not off base.

Best, Jay
