Hey Burns !

Please SEE ATTACHED LETTER. The Nalonai Headquarters would love to have Secretary Clinton as a key note speaker at
the National Convention in Minneapolis this August if her schedule would permit.

The leadership loves Hillary !II This all stems from her visit and speech at American Legion Mall in 2008 when she won
the Indiana Primary. She made a lot of friends here and always rerninises about her dad being active with the Legion in
Illinois.

When talking to Hillary could you put in a good word for her corning to the convention ??? I guarantee you she would
be the high point of the week and would receive a great reception. Attendance for key note speakers is usually around
10,000 members-a really good crowd.
