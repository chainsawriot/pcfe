Hi Jake,

A quick debrief for S:

We have had two long days of negotiations here. Not much progress on major purchases (boeings etc). Some on
indigenous innovation and intellectual property protection.

But now there is recognition at senior levels about how disappointed we are that more progress on
commercial/economic issues has not been made and we believe, leaders are working to encourage their team to put
together a bigger/better package.

I raised with Foreign Min the company issue you mentioned to him after your lunch -- and his staff is looking into it. They
have all the background.

I am flying back tomorrow. Will send more detailed email report after we have a final meeting with the ambassador
tomorrow am.

Regards,
Bob
