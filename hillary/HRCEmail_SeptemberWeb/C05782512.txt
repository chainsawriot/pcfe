TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Forces sent by Libya's new rulers stormed Muammar Gaddafi's birthplace on Thursday,
coming under heavy fire from fighters loyal to the ousted leader.

   "They have now entered the city. There was a coordinated push from the south, east and west and from along
the coast. I'm not sure how far they have been able to enter," NTC military spokesman Abdulrahman Busin told
Reuters.

    "They are coming under heavy fire. There is a particular problem with snipers."
