Subject: Iraqi politician assassinated -"TV channels (Reuters)


CAIRO (Reuters) - Unidentified attackers on Thursday killed Ali al-Lami, an Iraqi politician heading a
committee set up to purge Saddam Hussein loyalists after the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, Arab satellite stations
said.

   The Qatar-based Al Jazeera and Dubai-based Al-Arabiya channels said Lami had been "assassinated" in Iraq
but gave no farther details.

  A Shiite Muslim, Lami headed the Justice and Accountability Commission, which replaced a "de-
Baathification" committee created by U.S. administrators after the war.
