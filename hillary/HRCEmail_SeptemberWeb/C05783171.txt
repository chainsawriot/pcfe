SANAA, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Soldiers opposed to President Ali Abdullah Saleh have reached a ceasefire with
government forces, an opposition source said on Monday, after fierce gun battles erupted during a crackdown
on pro-democracy protesters,

  "They've reached a ceasefire agreement between the president's forces and those of (defected) General Ali
Mohsen's forces," an opposition source told Reuters.

   A top ruling party official told Reuters he had not been informed of a deal but expected an agreement later
on Monday night.
