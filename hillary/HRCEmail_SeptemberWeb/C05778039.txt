the political crisis in Lebanon after a Hezbollah-led coalition toppled the country's government. Anatolia news
agency, citing Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Selcuk Unal, said Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan will
meet Qatar's Emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, and Syrian President Assad January 17. Turkish
Foreign Minister. Davutoglu, who is in Iraq, will also travel to Syria for the meeting. Lebanon's caretaker Prime
Minister Sand Hariri visited Turkey as part of efforts to rally support after ministers allied to the Shiite militant
group resigned, bringing down his government.
