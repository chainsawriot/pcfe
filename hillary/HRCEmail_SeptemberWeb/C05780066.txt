Subject:                           CNN on Westerwelle



This is what CNN reported on Guido and vesting - I was surprised that he'd even have the "belongs to the people of
Libya" lean.

German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said participants in the Qatari capital, Doha, were discussing the possibility
of using frozen Libyan assets for the fund.

"I think this discussion about the trust fund is very interesting," he told reporters. "And we will look into it because the
frozen international money belongs, if it's government money, to the people of Libya."
