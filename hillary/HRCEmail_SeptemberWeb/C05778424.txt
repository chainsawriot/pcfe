Subject: Japanese Efforts to Stabilize Fukushima Reactor Progressing Positively (SBU)

(SBU) After an explosion at a reactor in Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant, the primary containment of the
reactor remains intact. The Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) has begun using seawater to cool the
shut-down reactor core, and media reports that this cooling process is expected to be finished soon. Chief
Cabinet Secretary Edano reported that radiation levels are decreasing and that the pressure inside the reactor is
dropping.
