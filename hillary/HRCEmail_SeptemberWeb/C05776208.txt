Subject: Madeleine's Track 2 with Turkey

Madeleine mentioned at Aspen and then called on Friday to remind me that USIP has asked her to spearhead a Track 2
dialogue with Turkey. She thinks it is a good idea; as do I. If you agree, we shd obviously check with Phil and then get
back to Madeleine. AM
