- From our team:

   There was explosion at reactor just after 3 this morning; but spokesman says not of reactor itself, and that
   pressure/temps are now diminishing. But govt says now three other reactors are in jeopardy. An NRC official is en route
   to Tokyo to help govt manage; all say no need to panic.
