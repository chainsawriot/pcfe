Subject: Large Libyan convoy arrives in Niger -sources (Reuters)


AGADEZ (Reuters) - A large convoy of Libyan armored vehicles escorted by the Nigerien military arrived in
the northern Niger desert town of Agadez late on Monday, a French military source and a Niger military source
told Reuters.

   The convoy contained between 200 and 250 Libyan military vehicles and included officers from Libya's
southern army battalions, and likely crossed from Libya into Algeria before entering Niger, the sources said.

   The French military source said he had been told Muammar Gaddafi and his son Saif al-Islam might be
considering joining the convoy en route to Burkina Faso, a landlocked West African state which has offered
Gaddafi and his family asylum and has a border with Niger.
