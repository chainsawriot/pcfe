Just got this info from daniel rubenstein who spoke to                                                                1.4(D)
Per         and his closest advisor:                                                                                  B1

A) resignation of whole government (not just the PM) will be announced tomorrow as part of the long-brewing process
to have a government reshuffle (talks about which are ongoing)

8) this is neither a negative nor dramatic development

C)he will continue on as caretaker

D) he will stay on in new government once formed unless line-up that results from the begotiations go really south

                                                                                                                     B1
