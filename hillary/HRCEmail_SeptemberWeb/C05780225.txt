BERLIN, April 14 (Reuters) - The United States is not going to review its military position on Libya despite a
request from France, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said on Thursday.

    Juppe met U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Berlin. "I
told her we need them and that we would like them to come back," Juppe told journalists. "I think that they will
stick to the same line, which is to say regular interventions when they are needed."

    U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton voiced concern at the meeting over "atrocities" in the rebel enclave of
Misrata, besieged by Libyan government forces, but gave no hint that Washington was prepared to re-engage in
air strikes under NATO command, which took over the operation's mandate on March 31.
