I think hezbollah has started preparing for the end of assad. For 1st time they denied having anything to do with the
repression, denied having any presence inside Syria. Today there are (unconfirmed ) reports they're setting up rocket
launchers in northern Lebanon possibly anticipating breakdown of security/chaos.
