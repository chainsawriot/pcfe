CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt's general prosecutor referred former housing minister Ibrahim Soliman and four of his
deputies to trial for squandering public funds, the state news agency said on Wednesday.

   Magdi Rasekh, the father-in-law of ousted President Hosni Mubarak's eldest son Alaa and former board
chairman at property developer SODIC, will also be referred for trial, news agency MENA said.
