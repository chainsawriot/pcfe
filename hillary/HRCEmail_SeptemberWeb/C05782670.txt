Subject: Plot to assassinate Afghan president foiled -agency (Reuters)

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghanistan's intelligence agency said on Wednesday it had thwarted a plot to assassinate
President Hamid Karzai after arresting a bodyguard and five people with links to the Haqqani network and al
Qaeda.

   The National Directorate of Security told a news conference the plotters had recruited one of Karzai's
bodyguards in order to kill him.

   It said those arrested were linked to the Haqqani network. The Haqqanis are one of three Taliban-allied
insurgent factions fighting in Afghanistan and perhaps the most feared.
