Subject: Some anti-US protests seen on anniversary (AP)

ISLAMABAD (AP) - Amid the ceremonies around the world mourning the victims of the 9/11 attacks on this
10th anniversary, there have been some scattered anti-American demonstrations.
   In the Pakistani cities of Islamabad and Multan, about 100 supporters of an Islamist political party stage anti-
U.S. protests to mark the anniversary. They held up banners that repeated conspiracy theories about the attacks.
   In Karachi, another 100 people protested the war in Afghanistan, which was launched in response to the
attacks.
   A few dozen demonstrators gathered outside the U.S. embassy in London. One group set fire to a depiction of
a U.S. flag during a minute's silence that was held to mark the moment when the first hijacked airliner hit the
World Trade Center.
   But the protests were overshadowed by the events paying tribute to those who died.
