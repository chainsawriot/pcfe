Subject: Libya disabled children school hit in NATO strike (Reuters)


TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Shattered glass litters the carpet at the Libyan Down's Syndrome Society, and dust covers
pictures of grinning children that adorn the hallway, thrown into darkness by a NATO strike early on Saturday.

   It was unclear what the target of the strike was, though Libyan officials said it was Muanunar Gaddafi
himself, who was giving a live television address at the time.

  "They maybe wanted to hit the television. This is a non-military, non-governmental building," said
Mohammed al-Mehdi, head of the civil societies council, which licenses and oversees civil groups in Libya.

  The missile completely destroyed an adjoining office in the compound that houses the government's
commission for children.

  The force of the blast blew in windows and doors in the parent-funded school for children with Down's
Syndrome and officials said it damaged an orphanage on the floor above.

   "I felt sad really. I kept thinking, what are we going to do with these children?" said Ismail Seddigh, who set
up the school 17 years ago after his own daughter was born with Down's.
