Forwarding results from focus groups in Pakistan on drug trafficking and corruption which is both troubling, and, as with
everything else in that country, sad. Note comments with respect to differentiation between "old" Taliban (good) and
"new" Taliban (bad).
                                                             Also note the number of instances where USG is
perceived as being behind and/or supporting most "bad" things. As with all focus groups this is just a snapshot in time
and may not be an absolutely accurate reflection of broad-based attitudes and opinions, although in this case my guess
is it's pretty close to reality.
