Subject: Where we are in my expanded role

Hi Cheryl- Now that I have been the Acting Coordinator for two months I wanted to share a few
thoughts. I am chest-deep in the expanded role and it is working well. I have been able to prioritize
the issues and we are coordinating well with EB and other bureaus. I recognize that there will soon be
an Energy Bureau and Assistant Secretary but in the meantime the dual-hatted role is working
optimally on key issues. I do feel strongly that at least for the foreseeable future there continues to be
the need for a high-level, credible Special Envoy reporting to the Secretary, working on a focused set
of issues. These issues include the Eurasian issues that I have been working on, Iraq, which is a natural
extension of Eurasian issues and where I am heavily involved here and at the White House, India,
China and the Mexico transboundary issues which are of major concern to S. I would like to stay
working on at least these issues. These suggestions are not incompatible with the goal to set up a
bureau. Let me know what you think. Best.. .Dick
