  Subject: UN: Prison break trial to begin Tuesday (AP)

 PORT-AU-PRINCE (AP) - A U.N. representative in Haiti says a trial in which 14 police officers are accused of
 killing at least 11 inmates during a prison escape is slated to begin on Tuesday.
    The defendants are charged with murder, attempted murder, arson and aid and abetting escape.
    The episode happened in the town of Les Cayes on Jan. 19, 2010, one week after the massive earthquake
 killed an estimated 300,000 people.
    A riot started when some of the 400-plus inmates tried to escape. Haitian police rushed the building and
 opened fire.
    The U.N. rep spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press.
    Haitian justice officials could not be reached for comment Saturday.
