Subject: Shootings kill 11 in Syria's Horns-activists (Reuters)


AMMAN (Reuters) - Syrian forces shot dead seven civilians in the city of Horns on Monday, and unidentified
gunmen killed four state workers, activists said, in one of the bloodiest days reported there since pro-democracy
protests erupted.

   Syria has faced international condemnation for its crackdown on a five-month uprising against the rule of
President Bashar al-Assad.

   Syrian authorities say they have deployed troops in Horns and in other Syrian cities in response to appeals by
inhabitants frightened by "armed terrorist gangs".

   The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said pro-Assad troops stormed at least three neighbourhoods in
the city, 165 km (100 miles) north of Damascus.

    Unknown gunmen opened fire on a bus carrying employees of the state-owned Syrian Petroleum Transport
Company, the Britain-based Observatory, headed by dissident in exile Rami Abdelrahman, added in
statement.

   The Observatory said witnesses reported gunfire and explosions in the city's five main residential districts
and market.

    Most independent media have been expelled from Syria, making it difficult to confirm reports.

  The army deployed in Horns and occupied the main square four months ago after large protests demanding
Assad's removal.

  Tension has since risen between the city's Sunni Muslim majority and districts inhabited by members of
Assad's minority Alawite sect.
