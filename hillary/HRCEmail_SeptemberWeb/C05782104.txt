That's absolutely right. Even if we could arrange a call tonight, it wouldn't do us much good. We need
Reid and McConnell to green light floor action, then line up Cornyn once we're there.

Have a sinking suspicion Locke is going to be tougher to resolve.

Burns just called me. I went through all our steps over past 24 hours. He repeated at least three times, this is only going
to get done if the Secretary herself calls Cornyn. He said he'd call Cheryl and speak to the Secretary when she was able
to talk.
