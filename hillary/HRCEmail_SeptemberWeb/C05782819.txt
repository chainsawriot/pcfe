Hi David please see what Cathy said earlier on. We clearly emphasize the need to come back to negotiations.
Abbas still not decided on what to do - SC/GA?
Cathy made the case for strong continued quartet involvement. I think she may want to talk to the Secretary
before she talks to Abbas tomorrow (I understand the call is now tomorrow)
Can you pass that on or should I talk to her office?
Best helga



                        Remarks by High Representative Catherine Ashton
                        following her address at the opening of the Arab League
                        Peace Initiative Follow-up Committee


                        "I have been in Cairo today to speak to President Abbas
                        and the members of the Arab Peace Initiative Committee. I
                        addressed the opening of the Committee meeting upon the
                        invitation of the League of Arab States.


                        I paid tribute to the successful statebuilding efforts of the
                        Palestinian Authority under the leadership of President
                        Abbas.


                        My message was clear: at a time when the whole world is
                        focusing on this issue, the EU remains strongly committed

              to achieving the two-state solution, with the State of Israel
              and the State of Palestine living side by side in peace and
              security. The only way to do that is through negotiations.


               The discussions which will take place at the UN in New
               York in the coming weeks will be an opportunity to achieve
               this. I want the Middle East Quartet to play an ambitious
               role and the international community to maintain strong
               and united support."
