Subject: Abbas must choose between Israel, Hamas -Netanyahu (Reuters)

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday Palestinian President
Mahmoud Abbas could not hope to forge a peace deal with Israel if he pursued . a reconciliation accord with the
Islamist group Hamas.

   "The Palestinian Authoritymust choose either peace with Israel or peace with Hamas. There is no possibility
for peace with both. Hamas aspires to destroy Israel and fires rockets at our cities ... at our children," Netanyahu
said after the two Palestinian groups announced they had overcome past differences.
