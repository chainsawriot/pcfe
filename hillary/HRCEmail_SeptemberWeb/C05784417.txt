 5:35 a.m.: The following members of the royal family leave Buckingham Palace
             for the abbey, arriving at 5:40: the duke of York, Princess Beatrice,

 5:51 a.m.: The bride and her father Michael Middleton leave the Goring Hotel
             for Westminster Abbey in a Rolls Royce.

 6:00 a.m.: The marriage service begins.

        ** Service is expected to last one hour.

        Musical Selections: The hymn "Jerusalem" by William Blake and the
        traditional "Greensleeves." Such well-known hymns as "Love Divine All
        Love Excelling" and "Guide Me 0 Though Great Redeemer" — better known
        in modern Britain as the Welsh rugby anthem "Bread of Heaven" — are also
        on the schedule. The bride will walk down the aisle to the choral anthem "I
        Was Glad" by Sir Charles Hubert Hastings Parry, composed for the
        coronation of William's great-great-great grandfather Edward VII at
        Westminster Abbey in 1902.

        The program also provides the wording to the couple's vows. Kate, like
        Princess Diana in her wedding to Prince Charles in 1981, will not promise to
        obey her husband. Instead she will vow to "love, comfort, honor and keep"
        William. Because only Kate will wear a wedding ring, only William will say
        "With this ring I thee wed" as he slips the band on his bride's finger.

  7:15 a.m.:    The carriage procession of the bride and groom with a captain's escort
                of the Household Cavalry, followed by the queen's procession with a
                sovereign's escort of the Household Cavalry, leaves the abbey for
                Buckingham Palace. The bride and groom will be in the 1902 state
                landau, or the glass coach if it is raining.

  7:30 a.m.: The bride's carriage procession arrives at Buckingham Palace.
                                                                                           2
