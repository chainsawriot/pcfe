Fyi.

Also, if you see an opening you could ask if he would consider coming with Nita Lowey to speak to young FS0s. We're
sending a letter today.

I see S is meeting him at 830. He is apparently reintroducing his habeas leg. Thurs and his staff gave critical comment to
Bob Bauer when Bob called him yesterday re the GTMO rollout. His general theme was that we were overlawyering the
periodic review process and D0.1 had too big a role in our Archives approach. Just fyi, in case he raises it.
