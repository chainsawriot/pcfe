Subject: Palestinian Authority Cabinet resigns (AP)

RAMALLAH (AP) - The Palestinian prime minister has dissolved his Cabinet in a new gesture that appears to
be inspired by unrest rocking the Arab world.
   President Mahmoud Abbas announced Monday he had accepted the decision by his prime minister, Salam
Fayyad.
   An aide to Fayyad says his boss hopes to form a new Cabinet dominated by technocrats who can build up
Palestinian institutions. He has up to six weeks to name the Cabinet.
   The decision is the latest in a series of dramatic moves by the Western-backed Palestinian Authority
following the unrest in Egypt and Tunisia. Mass protests have spurred calls for democracy throughout the
Middle East.
   The Palestinian government said over the weekend it would hold long-overdue general elections later this
year.
