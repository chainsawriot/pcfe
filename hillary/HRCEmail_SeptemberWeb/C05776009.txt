Dear Hillary,

I can't tell you how grateful I am for your offer to help support the advancement of a more sensible paradigm in
medicine.

Stories often tell more than facts and pictures and videos convey what strategic plans cannot â€” this is about
transforming medical care to match 21 century understanding of disease causation.

If you have time, read this story, at least watch the 30 second video of Isabel (this is on the front page of Huffington Post
today).

And share it with whomever you think might want to make a contribution to real change in medicine.

Thank you s00000 much! Attached a copy of the strategic plan and a letter to you from me about our vision and plan.

In service,

Your friend, Mark
