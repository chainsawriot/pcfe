Subject: Update on PSA

Wanted to update you all on the PSA and where things stand. The Ad Council placed the PSA on Wednesday.




Overall, based on the MNR report, our estimated online audience for the PSA launch story was 5.4 million, including
stories on Yahoo Finance, Forbes, and CNN. For just over 24 hours since the MNR distribution, this is fantastic pickup
per the Ad Council.




The Ad Council will continue to push this out domestically and giving us updates on where it is. They are targeting large
sporting events like U.S Open, etc. If you would like the full report with specific stories, I can send separately however
because the file is so large I do not want to max out everyone's inboxes.




On the International side and specifically S interest in placing with Al Jazeera, the Ad Council did a slightly modified
version of the 30 sec PSA, removing the texting information on the final screen and is overnighting the tape to the State
Department today. Once we have that (timing for Tuesday), we will work with Dana and PA to have the PSA placed
accordingly where makes sense.

Larry has already said that local stations in Pakistan liked the ad and were using it/reporting on it. As he is obviously
very busy, hard to know more beyond this point. IIP has been great and the revised ad is going up on America.gov. Will
work them to see what other embassy sites, etc we can promote this with.




We will continue to work to place the ad and will have donation reports on Tuesday that hopefully will reflect monetary
upticks as well. Let me know if you have any questions. Best, Katie
