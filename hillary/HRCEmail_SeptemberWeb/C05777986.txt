Subject: Thousands march in Moroccan capital to seek reform (AP)


RABAT (AP) - At least 2,000 people are marching in Morocco's capital to demand a new constitution that
would bring greater democracy in the North African kingdom.
   Demonstrators shouted slogans calling for economic opportunity, educational reform, better health services
and help in coping with rising living costs during the march on central Hassan II Avenue in Rabat.
   Some plainclothes police officers mingled in the crowd but police were generally discreet in the latest
demonstration in the Arab world after street protests toppled regimes in Egypt and Tunisia.
   Many protesters were young _ convened in part through social media like Facebook _ and a small group of
Islamists were taking part. The main target of the protest was Parliament, not King Mohammed VI.
