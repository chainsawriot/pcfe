Condi Rice: Pro-Choice, Libertarian ... and EvangelicalPolitics Daily

Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice declared in a recent interview that she is proudly evangelical

but also distanced herself from many of her fellow believers by saying that she tends to support abortion rights

and civil unions for gay couples, and she feels evangelicals too often alienate others with in-your-face rhetoric.

Full interview with Rice

Christianity Today

She spoke with online editor Sarah Pulliam Bailey about faith and foreign policy during her book tour

in New York City.
