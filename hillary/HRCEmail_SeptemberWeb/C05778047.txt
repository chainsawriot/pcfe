 Dear Hillary
It was great to see you. Thanks so much for giving another push to PNB. It was important for Bill and Kris to hear of your
interest directly. I think given what is going on it is more important than ever. FYI I am going to loop OPIC in more
Elizabeth Littlefield is really into development You were terrific this am with Christiane. I am getting the most amazing
reports from ,NDI people on the ground. Nothing about this is easy.
All best
Madeleine
Thank you so much for seeing us about PNB
