Subject: Syrian opposition agrees on national council's executive committee (Xinhua)


ISTANBUL (Xinhua) -- Syria's opposition agreed in principle Sunday to form a seven-member executive
committee for their national council following three days of deliberations behind closed doors in Turkey's
largest city of Istanbul.




The council will consist of three main bodies, which include a general assembly and a general secretariat that
will be headed by an executive committee, said Bassmah Ghodmani, a member of the council.




Ghodmani said the executive committee will have a rotating presidency but exact details and bylaws of the
council are still being prepared.




The council has stated its basic principles consist of toppling the Bashar Al-Assad regime, commitment to
peaceful nature of the revolution, opposition to any foreign intervention and maintaining the national unity of
Syria.




Syrian dissidents first announced the aim of forming the council in Istanbul on Aug. 23. On Sept. 15, the
council announced its makeup with 140 members from both within and outside Syria comprising various
sections of the Syrian society.

against the country which has been gripped by unrest for six months.
