I've told ops to hold any further dissemination until you have talked with these guys about how to execute the call back.

You will read in the memcon that Musa Kusa asked me that Bill come to Tripoli to discuss the US-Libya relationship and
that Pat come to discuss embassy issues. I also, as per Jeff s suggestion, said I was asking Amb Cretz to come back to DC
for consultations. Let's discuss how we follow up Monday.
