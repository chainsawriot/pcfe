Subject: Obama presses for human rights in Dalai Lama visit (Reuters)

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama underscored the importance of protecting human rights
for Tibetans in China during a meeting with exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama Saturday, the White
House said.

    Obama also reiterated the U.S. policy that Tibet is a part of China, the White House said in a statement.

   "The president stressed that he encourages direct dialogue to resolve long-standing differences and that a
dialogue that produces results would be positive for China and Tibetans," the White House said.
