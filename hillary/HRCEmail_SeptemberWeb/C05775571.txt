On another note, I hope we might have time to chat briefly before I leave State â€” maybe when you're in the office in
mid-August. Two issues I want to discuss: 1) sports diplomacy 2) a series of speeches I'd love you to give on young
people (the public diplomacy speech could be one piece).




 I'd also be happy to share some observations about this place if that might be useful to you.




Safe travels.
