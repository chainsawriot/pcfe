MUSCAT (Reuters) - An Omani activist who "instigated riots" in the industrial city of Sohar will face trial with
25 others for violent conduct, the chief prosecutor said on Saturday.

  He did not say when the accused would go to court or the exact charges they were facing but a statement said
"many other protesters" had been released.

  Security forces on Friday sealed off the site of violent clashes that left one dead on April 1 and stopped
worshippers from attending Friday prayers to prevent another protest.

  Demonstrations in Oman, inspired by a wave of protests that have spread across the Middle East and toppled
Egypt and Tunisia's leaders, have focused on demands for better wages, jobs and an end to corruption.
