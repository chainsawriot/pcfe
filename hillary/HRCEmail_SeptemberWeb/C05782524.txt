RAMALLAH (Reuters) - The United States is showing "disdain" for Arabs by trying to prevent the Palestinians
from gaining statehood recognition at the United Nations, a senior Palestinian official said on Wednesday.

    Washington fears the Palestinians' move at the United Nations, expected later this month, could further snarl
flagging U.S. efforts to revive Middle East peace talks, which broke down last year following a row over Jewish
settlements.

   David Hale, the U.S. Middle East peace envoy, was due to meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas later
on Wednesday in the latest American effort to halt the U.N. manoeuvrings and convince the two sides to return
to direct negotiations.

   Yasser Abed Rabbo, secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), said U.S. policy now
appeared confined to one point: stopping the Palestinians from embarking on their diplomatic initiative at the
United Nations.
