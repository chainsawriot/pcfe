See first bullet on rumors that head of libya's internal security service fled to Tunisia.

(U) Opposition Media -- Top Regime Figure Flees: According to Libyan opposition media TV station "Libya al-Ahrar," the
head of Libya's internal security service, Tuhami Khalid, fled to Tunisia on August 13. The same report suggested that
former security official, revolutionary committee leader and Qadhafi confidant Ammar Tayif also fled. A TNC MFA
source said he could confirm the report regarding Khalid but not Tayif. Khalid's departure would be a significant blow to
the regime, given his security portfolio.

(U) Military Update: TNC military forces continued to make progress toward taking Gharyan and Zawiyah during the day,
but fighting continued in both cities. One contact predicted that even if the rebels took Zawiyiah, loyalist forces would
re-group and attempt to take it back, given its proximity to Tripoli and strategic location on the main road to Tunisia.

(SBU) Jibril to Return to Benghazi to Discuss Forming a New Government: A senior foreign ministry official told us that
PM Mahmoud Jibril is planning to return to Benghazi on/about August 17 to resume discussions on reconstituting the
Executive Committee (i.e., cabinet). The official refuted reports that the Council is becoming divided into factions,
claiming that disagreements and differences reflect "legitimate politics" and are good for the Council. Nonetheless, he
expressed concern that the Council "is not qualified to lead" and that there is no clear division of powers between the
Executive Committee and the Council. As a result the Council regularly interferes with the Executive Committee. Another
problem is that the Council lacks transparency and does not do a good job of explaining its decisions to "the street." For
example, the TNC recently prepared a new plan for an interim constitution but "nobody knows about it or understands
it." The official expressed hope that the military gains made by the TNC this week would be a unifying force within the
TNC and Libyan society.
