dear hillary,
for fifteen years you've been a mentor to me, showing me how to weave direct service, what I do as a doctor, to high-
level policy, which often determimes who will be sick and who will be spared risk and which almost always determines
who will have ready access to care.

from your early patronage of my work on mdrtb in siberia to your unwavering support of our 90s work to make sure we
treated the poorest haitians with aids, to introducing me to wjc and encouraging me to work with chelsea when she was
still an undergrad. I have always counted on you, as you well know, for your judgement and wisdom and insight.

now I am to be accorded an honor in your footsteps, in the name of our hero Eleanor Roosevelt:
 i am to be granted the ER medal in val-kill on october 17th. i know how busy you are and how inconvenient this hamlet
is, but on the odd chance that you are not off in the middle east, in haiti, or in another corner of the world-- if you could
be there to award it, it would mean the world to me. But if you cannot rest assured it will be you in my heart quand
meme.

love
