Thanks so much for the chance to talk. I've relayed all your answers/suggestions to George Stevens, and we'll proceed
thus on all points. As for the reception, it'll be upstairs at the Kennedy Center, starting at 4:30.

 Again, Happy New Year to you, Bill, Chelsea and Mark — and to your terrific team.

 Strobe
