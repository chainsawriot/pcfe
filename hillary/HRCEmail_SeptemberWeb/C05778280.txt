                              SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED                             RELEASE IN FULL


                           Al-Jazeera's purported PA documents


      Al Jazeera announced it has almost 1,700 "confidential" documents related to
      Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts in its possession. It calls the documents the
      "Palestine Papers" and is airing 4 special broadcasts on the leaks. As far as we
      can determine, the documents appear to be authentic, but we cannot confirm
      that independently. So far, only sixteen of the purported documents, all in
      English, have been posted to Al Jazeera's website - with more certainly to come.
      Most are minutes and maps from Annapolis-era negotiating sessions (including
      the June 2008 trilateral meeting in which former Secretary Rice participated).
      None appear to be USG documents. So far the only document from the tenure
      of the current administration is a January 2010 session between D/SEMEP
      David Hale and Erekat.

      We believe that the leak of these documents will seriously damage the standing
      of the Palestinian leadership and complicate their ability to re-join a negotiating
      process. The documents that have been released so far reveal little of US
      negotiating strategy, but the impact of their release on the Palestinians will
      harm US peace efforts.

      The likely source of these documents is a former staffer from Saeb Erekat's
      PLO Negotiation Affairs Department (NAD). The NAD's subordinate
      Negotiation Support Unit (NSU), a donor-financed office staffed mainly by
      international personnel, has undergone significant staffing changes over the past
      year, and several personnel left disillusioned by Erekat and his management of
      the office. According to NSU staff this evening (in strict confidence), they were
      already aware of a major breach of information security.

      Al Jazeera's website coverage - which so far focuses on purported concessions
      by the Palestinian side on the highly sensitive refugee and Jerusalem issues -
      and the combative interview of Erekat on Al Jazeera this evening, have led
      many of our Palestinian contacts to speculate that Erekat stands to lose the most
      from these disclosures. That said, we can anticipate that President Abbas will
      stand with Erekat, even as he suffers criticism as well.

      Israeli liabilities appear fewer in the current tranche of documents. Most of the
      details of former PM Olmert's offer have already appeared in the public domain
      (including in a speech Olmert gave in late 2010). However, then-FM and
      current opposition leader Livni may suffer fallout from the disclosure of her

        Nizar Farsakh and Fouad HaIlak
      • Israeli: Udi Dekel, Dam Tirza, Leah Arad and Kamil Abu-Rukun

      Sides presented conflicting views on land swaps; Palestinian note-taker reported
      poor atmospherics and said Palestinians responded that Israeli presentation indicated
      a lack of good faith.


  5. Land Swap Proposal Map - 1.5%
      April 8, 2008
      Likely a Palestinian proposal, although not identified as such (as are documents
      numbers 6 and 7).

      • Palestinians side: Ahmad Qurei (Abu Ala') , Dr. Saeb Erekat, Dr.
        Samih al-Abed, Khaled Elgindi, Salah Ilayan, Zeinah Salahi
      • Israeli side: Tzipi Livni,Udi Dekel, Tal Becker, Dani Terza

      Abu Ala' seems to signal Palestinian willingness to compromise on refugees and
      Jerusalem. He discusses conditions for land swaps, including land swaps within
      parts of Jerusalem ("land in Jerusalem for land in Jerusalem"). He also notes that
      not all refugees will return to Israel: "The Palestinian state must have adequate
      land, capabilities and resources to absorb Palestinian refugees who do not prefer
      to return to Israel, and those who hope to return to Palestine."


  10. Meeting Minutes: Post-Annapolis Plenary Session on Territory
      May 21, 2008 Inbal Hotel Jerusalem,
      • Palestinian: Ahmed Querei (Abu Ala'), Dr. Saeb Erekat (SE), Dr.
        Samih ii Abd (SIA), Khaled Elgindy (KE), Salah Elayan (SA),
        Zeinah Salahi (ZS)
      • Israeli: FM Tzipi Livni (TL), Tal Becker (TB), Udi Dekel (UD),
        Dany Tirza (DT)

      Following a discussion of news reports regarding Israel's decision to negotiate
      with Syria over the return of the Golan, the meeting focused primarily on the
      Israeli side presenting their assessment of the Palestinian land-swap proposals.
      Livni touches on sensitive issues of Jerusalem and withdrawal from Golan.

      TL: ....Jerusalem is not included [on our map] because it's not being discussed
      here, but clearly we know it has to be discussed.
      [News comes in of 286 new units to be tendered in Betar
      TL: We're giving up the Golan so we need more in Betar

   11. Meeting Minutes: 8th Meeting on Territory
      May 29, 2008 Jerusalem, King David. Hotel
      • Palestinian: Dr. Samih Al-Abed, Azem Bishara, Hala Rashed,
        Fouad Hallak, Nizar Farsakh
      • Israeli: Udi Dekel, Dam Tirza, Lea Arad, and Kamil Abu Rukun


   12. Meeting Minutes: Trilateral - United States, Israel and Palestine
      June 15 2008 Jerusalem, Inbal Hotel
      • American side: - Condoleeza Rice, David Welch, Eliot Abrams,
        Jamal Hilal
      • Palestinian side: - Ahmad Qurei (Abu Ala), Dr Saeb Erekat, Salah
        Ilayan
      • Israeli side: Tzipi Livni, Tal Becker, Udi Dekel

      Abu Ala on Jerusalem: We proposed that Israel annexes all settlements in
      Jerusalem except Jabal Abu Ghneim (Har Homa). This is the first time in history
      that we make such a proposition; we refused to do so in Camp David.

      Secretary Rice discounts the idea of an international peacekeeping force in a
      Palestinian state. Referring to Iraqi PM Maliki and Canada as "incapable" in the
      context of border control/security issues, she reportedly says: "I have full trust in
      Nouni Malki, Iraq's Prime Minister, but he is incapable. Canada has sincere
      desire but there came a time when Canada was incapable of controlling the
      borders."

        Aleyan, Rami Dajani
      • Israeli: Tzipi Livni, Udi Dekel, Tal Becker

      Palestinian side tries to inject issue of Jerusalem into discussions; Israelis silent. At
      one point SE notes: It is no secret 1 that on our map we proposed we are offering you
      the biggest Yerushalayim in history. But we must talk about the concept of Al-Quds.


  14. Summary of Ehud Olmert's "Package" Offer to Mahmoud
  Abbas - August 31, 2008
      August 31, 2008

      This document purportedly summarizes PM Olmert's offer to Mahmud Abbas on
      territory, Jerusalem, refugees and security. Under the described agreement, Israel
      would annex 6.8% of the West Bank, and safe passage between Gaza and West Bank
      would be under Israeli sovereignty. Sovereignty over the Holy Basin would be
      delayed to a later stage. On refugees, Israel would acknowledge the Suffering of —
      but not responsibility for — Palestinian refugees. No mention is made of
      security. Most of the details of former PM Olmert's offer have already appeared in
      the public domain (including in a speech Olmert gave in late 2010).

      January 15, 2010 Jericho, NAD

      • Palestinians: Dr Saeb Erekat (SE), Rami Dajani
      • -US: David Hale (DH), Daniel Rubenstein, Rick Waters

      Some details of USG planning are exposed. Erekat expresses interest in opening
      a secret channel to the GOT:

      DH: Raise this with Molcho.
      SE: I will. I've tried to meet him before.
      DH: He's ready now.
      SE: I want to construct a channel so it doesn't go down in one day. We can't say
      we're resuming negotiations. We keep the channel secret. Use it to discuss our
      strategic relations. The priority is not to have collapse on the ground.
