VIENNA - (AP) A high-level meeting of the United Nations nuclear agency is convening to focus on
proliferation concerns from Iran, Syria and North Korea and post-Fulcushima nuclear safety.
   The board of the International Atomic Energy Agency will discuss written or oral reports on Iran, Syria and
North Korea that are critical of their defiance of the U.N. Security Council.
   The 35-nation meeting, which opens Monday, will also approve an action plan meant to tighten nuclear
safety and security in the wake of Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster.
