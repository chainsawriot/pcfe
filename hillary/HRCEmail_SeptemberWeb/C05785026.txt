Hasidic Newspaper Photoshops Hillary Clinton from
Iconic Photo

A Hasidic newspaper altered a photo of U.S. leaders being briefed on the Bin Laden mission since it included Hillary
Clinton


â€¢A big hat-tip to Failed Messiah (who gave a hat-tip to Critical Minyan) for breaking the news that an Ultra-
Orthodox Hasidic Jewish newspaper, Der Tzitung, has determined that the photo of top U.S. leaders receiving
an update on the mission against Osama bin Laden was too scandalous.

What was so offensive about the image? U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was in the photo and, based on
good intel, the editor of Der Tzitung discovered that she is a woman. The Hasidic newspaper will not
intentionally include any images of women in the paper because it could be considered sexually suggestive. The
iconic photo shows President Obama, Vice President Biden, and members of the U.S. National Security Team
in the Situation Room of the White House. Secretary of State Clinton, wearing a long-sleeved suit jacket, sits
with her hand over her mouth. I'm not sure how Der Tzitung determined this was a racy photo. Perhaps they just
don't like the idea of a woman with that much political power.

Der Tzitung edited Hillary Clinton out of the photo, thereby changing history. To my mind, this act of
censorship is actually a violation of the Jewish legal principle of eneivat da'at (deceit). I wrote about this
subject a year ago following the Flotilla debacle in Israeli waters outside Gaza when the Reuters news agency

doctored photos that it published by removing weapons from individuals aboard the Mavi Marmara. The
doctoring of photographs like this is referred to as "Fauxtograpphing." I'm curious to hear how Der Tzitung
responds to its attempt to remove Hillary Clinton from this iconic photo and thereby from this historic event.
