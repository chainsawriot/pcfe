  Cheryl, AM,

  I've attached Admiral Mullen's 2011 guidance that just came out today. He makes a direct reference to supporting
  implementation of the QDDR (in conflict prevention and response) on p. 6 at the bottom in the Conclusion. Just this line
  alone will result in a trickle down effect that will lead DoD and the military to look for our leadership and a more formal
  mechanism to support us in this area. Our implementation planning on conflict prevention and response would benefit
  from a very active effort and a more formal initiative to harness DoD. The final report makes room for this by making
  CSO a center for civil-military collaboration on conflict - but it does not say much more than that. So the details will need
  to be worked out in implementation planning.

  I've had two people from DoD send me this document today asking what our plans are and looking for some direction on
  next steps :)

  Best,
  Karen
