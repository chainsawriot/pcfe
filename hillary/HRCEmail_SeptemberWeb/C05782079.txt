Subject: Libya Res. -- Senate Debate


Senate Majority Leader Reid is expected to file cloture today on S. I Res 20, the Kerry-McCain Libya
resolution. This sets up a procedural vote on Tuesday evening to take up and debate the
resolution. They're expected to get the 60 votes needed to proceed to debate and consideration of the
resolution, setting up a week of Libya debate on the Senate floor next week.

We won't know for a while what amendments will be considered or when a final vote may occur.

Apologies if I left anyone off in my rush to share this development.

Thanks.
