Subject: UN to Assad: Military force on civilians must stop (Reuters)


UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The U.N. chief told Syrian President Bashar al-Assad August 6 that he was
alarmed by the escalating violence in Syria and demanded that Assad stop deploying the military against
civilians.

   "In a phone conversation with President Assad of Syria today, the Secretary-General (Ban Ki-moon)
expressed his strong concern and that of the international community at the mounting violence and death toll in
Syria over the past days," the U.N. press office said in a statement.

    It added that Ban "urged the president to stop the use of military force against civilians immediately."
