We were to have a press conference with him tom'w morning at the Press Club to release the Microcredit campaign's
(which you inaugurated in
1907) 2011 report on the state of microfinance. The press event will go forward (and I'm participating) and Yunus will be
either on live video (if they can make it work) or on phone hook-up. He would like to keep his appointment with you on
Tuesday via a phone call.

In the meantime, we are trying to deal with the aftermath of the front page Post story on Afghanistan, USAID and
women. We are sure to be asked about it over and over this week, and typically no one clued us in even with efforts to
be more strategic.

The NEWSWEEK cover is great. I haven't had a minute to read the article yet.

Sorry, I have to cancel my trip to the US. Situation does not allow me to leave the country.

Sorry for the inconveniences.
