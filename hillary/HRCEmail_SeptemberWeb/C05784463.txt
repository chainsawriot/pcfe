Subject: France says Britain also deploying helicopters in Libya (Reuters)


BRUSSELS, May 23 (Reuters) - Britain is to start deploying attack helicopters in Libya along with France as
part of the West's operation there, French Defence Minister Gerard Longuet said on Monday.

   "The British, who have similar resources to us, are going to do the same thing we are," Longuet told
reporters in Brussels, after Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said earlier that France and other coalition members
would deploy helicopters in Libya.

    He said the British would start as soon as possible and that no other nation planned to follow suit.
