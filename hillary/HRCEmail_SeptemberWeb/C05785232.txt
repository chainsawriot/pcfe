Hello Sara


                                                                                           EVERYTHING I have heard - and I
have heard from people who really know

that your friend HRC did not merely come down on the side of the angels but was, herself the quintessential avenging
angel. What she has done is the greatest act of friendship to Israel         imaginable.

I know your life has been steeped in the deep relationship you forged with the Clintons.
You made the right choice.




Your friend,

Danny
