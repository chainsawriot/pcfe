Subject: Bomb targets top Pakistani policeman; 4 killed (AP)


KARACHI (AP) - Police say a large bomb exploded outside the house of a senior police officer in the southern
Pakistani city of Karachi, killing at least four people.
   Karachi police chief Saud Mirza says Monday's blast targeted the home of Chaudry Aslam, a top official in
the Crime Investigation Department. The unit is tasked with cracking down on the Taliban and other militants.
   Police officer Tanveer Ahmed said at least four people were killed, but Aslam was not harmed.
   Aslam appeared on local television following the attack and blamed the Pakistani Taliban.
   Mirza said the explosion left a crater at least 10-feet (3-meters) deep outside Aslarn's home. It blew out the
windows of cars and neighboring homes in the residential area.
