War on terror: Obama softened the language, but hardened Muslim hearts



The Obama administration's shift in counterterrorism language sought to bridge the divide with the Muslim world and
soften Americans' fear of Islam. But the new rhetoric hasn't matched policy, and the unintended costs at home and
abroad have been high.

New Haven, Conn. —

One of the most defining aspects of the Obama administration's counterterrorism strategy has been its effort to change
                                                                                                                                (
America's rhetorical approach to the threat of terrorism <http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2009/0129/obama-
redefines-war-on-terror> , particularly Islamic terrorism. "The language we use matter's," President Obama told the
Arabic satellite television station Al Arabiya in an interview during his first week in office. Scrubbed were George W.
Bush-era terms like "war on terrorism," "radical Islam," and "jihadist." <http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0901/p03s03-
uspo.html> The White House's 2010 National Security Strategy formally replaced the term "Islamic terrorism" with
"violent extremism."

The purpose of the shift in semantics was two-fold.

First, it aimed to repackage the fight against terrorism as a specific fight against Al Qaeda, not against Islamic extremism,
which Mr. Obama believes contributed to a post-9/11 perception that America was "at war with Islam." Indeed, the new
rhetoric <http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Globa I-News/2009/0604/in-fra nce-oba ma-e rases-the-us-vs-them-
rhetoric> has gone hand in hand with Obama's outreach to the Muslim world
<http://www.csmonitorcom/World/Middle-East/2009/0605/p06s01-wome.html> to build "a new partnership based on
mutual respect and mutual interest."

Second, it was part of a broader effort to soften Americans' fear of Islamic terrorism, which Obama officials believe plays
directly into the hands of extremists.



Language change ineffective



Now it is fair to ask whether Obama's use of language regarding terrorism has proven effective. Startling new polls
suggest it hasn't. The first, by the Brookings Institution in Washington, shows that between May 2009 and May 2010 the
number of Middle Eastern Arabs expressing optimism in Obama's approach toward their region dropped
<http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2010/0806/0bama-s-popularity-may-be-down-in-US-but-he-s-even-
less-popular-among-Arabs> from 51 percent to just 16 percent, with those describing themselves as "discouraged" by
the Obama presidency rising from 15 percent to 63 percent.

The second, by the Pew Research Center, shows that in August 2010 fewer Americans held a favorable view of Islam (30
percent) than five years earlier during the Bush administration (41 percent), with more Americans (35 percent) saying
Islam encourages violence more than other religions (in 2002, it was 25 percent).

These starkly negative trend lines suggest the limited utility of language in fighting terrorism. Yes, terrorism is a
propaganda-fueled activity — an ongoing battle to win hearts and minds <http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-
East/2009/0603/p06s16-wome.html > and attract new recruits to fight for the cause. And of course the language used in
combating terrorism <http://www.csmonitorcom/USA/Foreign-Policy/2008/0801/p02s01-usfp.html > is vital — the
counterproductive "smoke 'em out" rhetoric of the Bush administration <http://www.csmonitor.com/2001/0919/p12s2-
woeu.html > is a case in point.

 But if rhetoric does not match policy, or appears to discount or play down threats, the credibility — and thus
 effectiveness — of the overall counterterrorism strategy may be undermined. It appears the Obama administration has
•dug itself into just such a hole.



Rhetoric doesn't match policy



When looking beyond the nuanced language and appealing promises, what Muslims around the world see is an
administration that has ramped up the war in Afghanistan
<http://www.csmo nitorcom/USA/Politics/2010/0609/0ba ma-wa nts-more-money-for-Afgha n ista n-wa r.-Wil I-Congress-
grant-it> ; is killing scores of Muslim civilians with drone strikes <http://www.csmonitor.com/World/terrorism-
security/2010/0915/US-drone-attacks-bombard-Haqqani-network-in-Pakistan > ; continues to hold more than 1,000
Muslim detainees in Guantanamo <http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Topics/Guantanamo >, Bagram, and other prisons;
and maintains seemingly unconditional support of Israel.

This is not to critique these policies, but to point out that they do not match the raised expectations of the Muslim world
and have only muddled Obama's oft-stated goal of turning Muslims toward America and away from extremist
movements.



The price of downplaying the threat



A large price is also being paid domestically for disconnected rhetoric. Despite maintaining nearly all of Bush's hard-line
tactics — the USA Patriot Act <http://www.csmonitorcom/USA/Politics/2010/0301/0bama-signs-Patriot-Act-extension-


     UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776032 Date: 09/30/2015

without-reforms> , warrantless surveillance, indefinite detentions — the White House has consistently played down the
threat, even in the face of a clear uptick in terrorism activity.

For example, following the failed 2009 Christmas Day airline bombing
<http://www.csmonitorcom/USA/Politics/2010/0102/Calling-it-war-Obama-pegs-Christmas-Day-attack-to-Al-Qaeda > ,
Obama described the suspect as an "isolated extremist," despite his ties to Al Qaeda. And the administration's initial
response to the failed May 2010 Times Square bombing <http://www.csmonitorcom/USA/2010/0509/Times-Square-
bombing-Sign-of-desperation-from-Pakistan-Taliban > by an American Muslim trained in Pakistan was to call it a "one-
off" event. Attorney General Eric Holder stated <http://www.csmonitorcom/USA/Justice/2010/0203/Holder-letter-why-
we-read-Christmas-Day-bomber-his-rights> in congressional testimony that he believed these and other recent Islamic
terror plots were unconnected, and unrelated to radical Islam.

There is little doubt that the administration's unwillingness to speak candidly about Islamic terrorism has taken a toll on
the public's trust. A Gallup poll released last month shows Americans favoring Republicans over Democrats on the issue
of terrorism 55 percent to 31 percent — up from 49 percent to 42 percent last fall.


Time to reverse the trend



Obama entered office promising to fight a smarter and more effective war on terrorism, and in many ways he has. His
instincts to maintain aggressive tactics while toning down inflammatory rhetoric
<http://www.csmonitorcom/2006/0517/p09s01-cojh.html > were sound. Yet his administration seems to have
overlearned a key lesson of the Bush years—that overstating the threat of terrorism
<http://www.csmonitorcom/2007/0418/p04s01-woeu.html > has costs attached. So, too, does rhetoric that
understates the threat, especially when detached from policy.

It is not too late to reverse this troubling trend. The White House can begin by focusing less on overly reassuring rhetoric
— which has not paid dividends at home or abroad — and more on a candid accounting of the threats faced
<http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0905/p14s02-bogn.html > and the policies employed to confront them.
