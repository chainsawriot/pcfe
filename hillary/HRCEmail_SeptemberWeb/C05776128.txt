Subject: Memo to HRC

Dear Jake,

As you may know, before the Secretary left for her trip to Europe, she asked to see me and discussed a number of
sensitive issues. She asked for some additional ideas which I have detailed in the attached memo. I'd be very grateful if
you could give it to her.

Many thanks,

Martin.
