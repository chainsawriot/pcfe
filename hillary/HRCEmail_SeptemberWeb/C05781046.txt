Subject:                          Leal case



As expected, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles voted 4:1 against a reprieve for Leal yesterday afternoon and 5:0
against clemency. The Governor could still grant a 30 day stay on his own, but he has never done so,




                                                                The execution is scheduled to take place Thursday
(tomw) at 7 pm est, so we may get news from the Court tonite. Stay tuned.
