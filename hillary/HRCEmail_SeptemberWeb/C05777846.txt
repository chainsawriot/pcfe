Subject: Jackson Diehl Editorial

Madame Secretary, as we understood on Wednesday, our conscious decision not to mention domestic Egyptian issues
publicly was noticed at the Post editorial board. I had multiple exchanges with Jackson over the course of the day
yesterday. Based on your colloquy with Aboul-Gheit and Jeff's follow-up, we are quoted in the piece which you see in
the clips as having a direct and spirited exchange with the Egyptians and that there was no misunderstanding of the
importance that we attach to these issues. So in the end Jackson grants some credit for the discussion, and we agree to
disagree on the degree to which this discussion should be public.
