Here is the latest from Lissa, Jake, and me (I took over from Lissa this morning because her son is winning all his soccer
matches somewhere in Pennsylvania). We still have a bunch of things to add (as you will see in yellow), but this is
definitely ready for you to engage. I think it will make a real impact, and it fits Jim Hoge's desire not just to make this a
report card on the QDDR but to advance some bigger animating ideas.

Some questions:




I hope this is a read that improves your vacation mood rather than detracting from it!
