I'd do all that too if I were writing them. And believe me, we have tried.

I thought the piece today in the Post was as good as it could be for where it was. But for the other pieces being done
from 60 Minutes to NYT I'd turn it away from personnel (and "Hillaryland," etc) to substantive policies. I'd organize it
thematically, too, off top of my head: 1. strategy replacing inherited chaos (AfPak, Mideast, Iran, Iraq, etc.); long-term
view on results. 2. Defining new global geopolitics: energy, Africa, Russia, China; 3. Achievements: NI, whatever else; 4.
21st salience of women. I'm sure there are more or other ways of doing this, but something like this. But get it away
from personnel (they're drilling for poison) and potential gossip about your relationship with Obama, which is what they
really want. then there's another subject about the power of diplomacy as a tool of national security policy. Sid

Re: Shaun, NI, St. Patrick's Day




Shaun requests that he bring to the State Department to meet you on March 17 and

to the Whhite House St. Patrick's Day event a woman named Kate Carroll, the

widow of a policeman murdered last year by the Continuity IRA, who has been a

key figure in the campaign for the peace process.




I have included Shaun's email to me below and a BBC story on Kate Carroll:




1.   Shaun's email on Kate Carroll




We discussed the possibility of arranging for HRC to meet Kate Carroll next

week during the St Patrick's Day celebrations.




Next week Kate is coming to the United States on March 16th. Kate is an

extraordinary woman whose voice on Tuesday ( the first anniversary of her

husband Constable Stephen Carroll's murder ) was critical in persuading all

the DUP to make their vount count and ensure that the cross community vote

succeeded.




Kate would herself admit that before her husband's brutal murder, she was a

quiet and timid person who would never have been found to speak up. Stephen's

death led her to find her voice and make it vital.




Her courage in the days after Stephen's murder inspired all the politicians

to come out and call for unity and peace. Martin M and Peter R both visited

her at home.




Since then Kate has tried to piece together her life. But this week she

decided to speak out about the senseless of life without Stephen and to use

it as an appeal to everyone still engaged in violence in NI to stop.




On Tuesday she gave television and radio interviews, press and media

coverage to her "terrible" anniversary. But she wanted it to be used for

peace. She appealed to the politicians to put aside their differences and

vote for devolution.




Kate is a vital voice.




Kate now wants to set up a charity to encourage young people to reject the

NI of the past and ensure that no young person wastes their life in

violence. In doing this she is a source of inspiration and leadership

against conflict and those who would be drawn in.




For HRC, I can only imagine that Kate is the model of 'vital voices." It

would be wonderful to ask Kate to come to Washington - probably on the

morning of the 17th March - and bring her to State to meet the Secretary of

State. Perhaps also at HRC's invitation I could also bring her to the

reception in the evening at The White House.




2.    BBC story




Murdered policeman's widow appeals to politicians

For Kate Carroll, every Monday is a rerun of the day her husband was shot dead.

She counts down the events of 9 March 2009 on the clock.

"Monday, 10 O'clock was when Steve would have rung me," she said.

"Half past ten - Steve died. At 20 past 11, Graham came to the door to tell me

that Steve had been killed.

"I relive that all the time. That is just my Mondays."

Exactly a year ago, Constable Stephen Carroll, 48, was responding to a call for

.help in Craigavon. It was a trap.

The Continuity IRA was lying in wait. They shot him dead. He was the first PSNI

officer to be murdered in Northern Ireland.

Speaking shortly afterwards, Kate said his killers were "sick".

"They have robbed my son of his father, my grandkids of their grandfather, my

mum of her son. And me of my life," she said.

"Part of my life has gone. I feel now that I'm dead inside."

A year on, Kate Carroll said her pain was "as raw as ever".

"I don't think I have quite accepted that Steve has gone, although there is a

grave to prove he is not there any more," she said.

"To me, Steve is still in my heart. I think about him every day I write to him

every night. I can't move on from him but I'm trying my best."

But with family and friends' support, she has worked to keep her husband's

memory alive.

In her garden, there is a tree planted in his memory.

"It is my Steve's tree. It is called the ghost tree. It has a special meaning...

I go out and look at it and I just love it," she said.

A year ago, Steve Carroll was counting down time in his job, looking forward to

a new kind of future with his family.

Before he left for work that Monday, he had talked about the increasing level of

violence, after the murder of two soldiers the previous Saturday.

"He said to me just as he was going out: 'Wouldn't it be ironic, just with my

last year-and-a-half, that something would happen?'

"He said: 'Love you, see you tonight'. We kissed each other at the door. He

smiled and away he went. That was the last I saw of him."

For Kate Carroll, the anniversary is one of the worst days she can think about.

As politicians in the Northern Ireland assembly prepare to vote on the transfer

of policing and justice powers, she will be remembering exactly one year ago,

when her husband's regular phone call wasn't made, when the knock came to the

door that changed her world.

"I hope and pray that this will be the last policeman's wife who has to sit here

and explain how she feels because her husband has been taken away by a bullet."

But, she points out: "This is a very big day for Northern Ireland."

"Hopefully something good will come out of this. That's my role to make sure

Steve hasn't died in vain. Nobody wants this so-called war to be carried on."
