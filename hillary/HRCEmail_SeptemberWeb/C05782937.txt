Subject: Arab League calls for dialogue in Syria (Reuters)


CAIRO (Reuters) - The Arab League plans to bring together Syria's government and opposition groups to seek
ways to end the violence in the country, Qatar's Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani said on Sunday.

   Defying calls for Syria's suspension from the regional body over a worsening army crackdown on political
unrest, the League decided to form a committee to forge dialogue between the government and opposition.

  "We will call all of the parties of the opposition and government to hold a dialogue within 15 days," the
League's Secretary General Nabil Elaraby said after an emergency meeting of Arab foreign ministers in
Cairo.
