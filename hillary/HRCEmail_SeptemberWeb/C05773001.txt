Thank you, and best wishes to you and your family for a wonderful New Year as well.

We contacted WH staff right away, and I understand letters from both POTUS and the VP have been sent to



Sarah Nolan and I have each also spoken to
They are still working out some of the details, but he has promised to keep us apprised. I'll be sure to give him a call
tomorrow.

First, I wish the happiest and healthiest of new years to you and your family and I'm looking forward to the work ahead
in 2010. Thank you for all you've done this past year.

Do you remember when I was waiting to testify w Gates before the SFRC and I I was talking to
                                          Did I ask you to see if you could get sympathy letters from the POTUS and VP
? I made a note but can't remember whom I asked and wanted to be sure we had followed up. Pls let me know. Thx.
