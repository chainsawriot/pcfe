As we close up shop here in the Embassy's control room, here are final observations from our teams:

-    Polls closed on time throughout the country, and counting began in an orderly fashion. Poll closing was
more problematic in the Port-au-Prince area; some voting centers obeyed the 5pm extended closing but others
did not. There were no reports of violence relating to closing of voting centers. OAS, CNO and other groups
report the same overall satisfaction with the voting process.

-     U.S. and Canada teams reported across-the-board results in favor of Michel Martelly. Obviously, this is
just anecdotal, but so far we have Martelly leading 12,160 to Manigat's 3,311. Local press is beginning to
report numbers in favor of Martelly in Port-au-Prince. International press is reporting smoother elections than
November 28 and uncertainty regarding turnout. Mulct will make an official statement this evening, but it
hasn't been released yet.

-    OAS speculates turnout was around the same as November 28, perhaps a little higher because more people
were able to find their polling places. It's impossible at this point to make any judgment about turnout.

     We will have Embassy people at the CTV starting when it opens tomorrow at 6am.

Here are two great pictures to end the day â€” the first is of a woman voting, and the second is vote counts taking
place.
