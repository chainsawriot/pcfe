DEHIBA (Reuters) - Artillery fire from forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi landed in the Tunisian
border town of Dehiba on Sunday, a Reuters correspondent in the town said.

   The correspondent said most of the shells landed in the outskirts of the town, where there are only a few
houses. There were no reports of any casualties. Pro-Gaddafi forces have been fighting rebels on the Libyan
side of the border.
