Subject: Pakistan's PM Gilani hits back at U.S. accusations (Reuters)


ISLAMABAD, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Pakistani Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani used a dinner for aid agencies
and foreign diplomats on Saturday to hit back against U.S. assertions that his country's powerful spy agency
was linked to militant groups fighting coalition troops in Afghanistan.

   "The propaganda blitz against Pakistan is indeed most unfortunate," he said at the dinner, at an Islamabad
hotel that was the target of a suicide truck bombing in 2008 that killed at least 54 people. "It vitiates the
atmosphere and is counter-productive. It tends to ignore the sacrifices by the people of Pakistan and negates all
that we have endeavoured to achieve over the last so many years."

   Gilani was responding to Senate testimony on Thursday by outgoing chairman of the U.S. joint chiefs of
staff Admiral Mike Mullen, who said Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate was linked to militant
groups who carried out the Sept. 13 attack on the U.S. embassy in Kabul, which killed 12 people.

  "The allegations betray a confusion and policy disarray within the U.S. establishment on the way forward in
Afghanistan," Gilani said.

   "Blame-game is self-defeating," he added. "We strongly reject assertions of complicity with the Haqqanis or
of proxy war."
