Further Brazil intervened a number of times, at last night's friends of the chair budget
meeting, unfortunately their message was not different than their previous ones. Brazilian
Rep. specifically stated he wanted to correct any impression that might have been made at the
last Friends meeting. "Brazil is not demanding efficiencies; we are happy with the DG's
proposed PWB."
