HRC,

Simon intended this for you. Pis see note from on-the-ground spec ops officer. Probably no surprise to you, but gives a
real-time sense of that officer's honest frustration and his willingness to share it with his former comrade in arms. Bit of
a gut check when I read it. Best,

Marty

FYI




You might want to relay this, in parenthesis, to our mutual friend. When people like Rob feel like this something is very
badly wrong.                                                                                                                    1




Aye




Simon

I am still in southern Afghanistan, but am increasingly skeptical of our chances for success. The Afghans just have not
stepped up and shown the political will or interest in doing much to make their situation better. At the end of the day
that must happen. That said,




Best regards to all there,
