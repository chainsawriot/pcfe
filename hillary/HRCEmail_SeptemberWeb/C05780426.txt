Subject: Yemen protesters demand wounded leader's ouster (AP)



SANAA (AP) - Nearly 100,000 Yemenis are protesting in a main square of the capital demanding the wounded
president, currently outside the country, be removed from power.
   During Friday's protest, opposition tribesmen marched through the square in a funeral procession with the
bodies of 41 of their fighters killed in a bombardment by government forces a week ago. Crowds chanted, "The
people want the butcher put on trial," referring to President All Abdullah Saleh.
   In another part of the city, several thousand Saleh supporters held a rally outside his presidential palace.
   Saleh was wounded in an explosion at his palace on June 3 and was evacuated to Saudi Arabia for treatment,
leaving a power vacuum in the capital.
