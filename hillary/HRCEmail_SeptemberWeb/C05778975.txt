Subject: Emirates' exiles in spotlight after Mubarak fall (AP)

DUBAI (AP) - For political figures in exile, the United Arab Emirates has been a luxury refuge, a base for
plotting attempted comebacks and - for at least one unable to escape assassins - a final stage. There is no
shortage of speculation that Egypt's Hosni Mubarak could join the list.
   The Dubai-based network Al-Arabiya reported Saturday that the former Egyptian president was making plans
to head to the Emirates. A Kuwait daily, Al-Qabas, said Friday that UAE officials have offered Mubarak haven
in Al Ain, a desert city near the Omani border.
   UAE officials have made no public comment on the reports, which were so persistent that the UAE's state
news agency WAM issued a rare denial Sunday of bulletins that Mubarak's plane had landed in the Sharjah
emirate north of Dubai.
