Subject: UK's Cameron on surprise visit to Afghanistan (Reuters)

CAMP BASTION (Reuters) - British Prime Minister David Cameron, on an unannounced visit to Afghanistan
on Monday, said while Afghan security forces were increasingly able to operate independently, Britain planned
to withdraw only a "relatively small" number of troops.

   Highlighting the fragility of security gains in the near decade-long conflict, Cameron's planned trip to the
town of Lashkar Gah in southern Helmand province had to be cancelled to concentrate resources on finding a
missing British soldier.
