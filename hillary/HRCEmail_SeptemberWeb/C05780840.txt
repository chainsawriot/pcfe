Subject: Egypt dissolves Mubarak's former ruling party (AP)



 CAIRO (AP) - An Egyptian court has ordered the dissolving of the country's former ruling party and the
confiscation of its assets, meeting a major demand of the protest movement that ousted President Hosni
Mubarak.
   The Supreme Administrative Court has 'announced the verdict on Saturday, ordering the National Democratic
Party to disband and hand over its assets and offices to the state. Lawyers had raised a suit demanding its
dissolution, accusing the party of corruption.
   The move was the latest concession by Egypt's military rulers to demands of the protest movement, coming
days after the ousted Mubarak and his sons were put under detention for investigation on allegations of
corruption and involvement in the killing of protesters.
