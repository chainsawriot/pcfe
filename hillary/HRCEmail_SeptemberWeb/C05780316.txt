Subject: Saudi Shfites rally for second day, call for rights (Reuters)


RIYADH (Reuters) - Hundreds of Saudi Shi'ites protested in the oil-producing east for a second day on Friday,
calling for the release of prisoners held without trial and political and religious rights, activists said.

    The protesters took to the streets in the Shi'ite Muslim centre of Qatif in Eastern Province and in the nearby
village of Awwamiya. They carried banners showing solidarity with the Shi'ites of neighbouring Bahrain who
have been targeted by police after the government cracked down on a protest movement.

   The rally was a continuation of protests held in Qatif and Awwamiya a day earlier calling for release of
detainees, an end of arbitrary arrests, and political and religious freedoms including an end to official ban on
protests.
