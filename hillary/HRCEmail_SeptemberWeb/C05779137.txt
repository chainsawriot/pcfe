PALM COAST (AP) - Officials say the nephew of the Dalai Lama has been killed along the side of a Florida
highway during a 300-mile "Walk for Tibet."
  The Florida Highway Patrol says 45-year-old Jigme K. Norbu was hit by an SUV about 7:30 Monday night
along State Road AlA along the east coast.
  Norbu of Bloomington, Ind., was the son of the Dalai Lama's late brother, Taktser Rinpoche.
