Subject: Pakistan police chief: American may not be free (AP)

LAHORE (AP) - A Pakistani police chief who said August 25 that a kidnapped American development expert
had been freed is now retracting his statement.
   The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad also says that it cannot confirm that Warren Weinstein, 70, is free.
   Weinstein was kidnapped almost two weeks ago in the eastern city of Lahore.
   Lahore police chief Malik Ahmed Raza Tahir initially said police traced Weinstein to the city of Khushab,
125 miles (200 kilometers) northwest of Lahore, and freed him early Thursday. He backtracked about an hour
later and said he could not confirm or deny Weinstein was free.
   "We have no information that would confirm recovery of Warren Weinstein, but we are hoping for a positive
outcome," the U.S. embassy said on Twitter.
