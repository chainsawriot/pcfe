The Senator called to ask me to raise the Egyptian custody case of the mother absconding w her children from the US
using fake passports. He said he has reason to believe if I ask Mubarak directly, "you could bring the kids home w you."
Do you know about this?

I'd like to have a letter to Mubarak prepared outlining the facts that I could discuss and leave w him, assuming any of
this makes sense.

Pis advise.
