Thanks very much. You championed this cause before it was popular, and the rest of the world is now catching up. The
response from the press, activists, and the 55 embassies that participated has been extremely positive -- you're the new
patron saint of civil society. And you're right that we couldn't have timed it better with a crystal ball. The launch was
assembled with zero staff and zero budget. Now that I have a little backup I hope we can deliver even more progress.
Have a very happy Presidents' Day -- you certainly deserve it -- and I'll send you an info memo with our follow up plans
at the end of the week.

Warm regards,
Tomicah

Dear Tomicah--

 With everything going on, I am late in thanking you for the success of our Strategic Dialogue w Civil Society. I thought it
was an excellent concept well-executed and very timely! I appreciate your leadership in this important effort.

  All the best--H
