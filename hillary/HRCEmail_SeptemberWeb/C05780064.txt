0900 became 1000. Lasted 45 minutes. Mission accomplished. Damascus hi-side down. Should have report in by 0900
your time - best estimate. I have another meeting to go to (follow-on to last night's) and it may take some time for
tekkies to re-boot system. But key meeting is done. Feel good despite a mainly sleepless night. Best, Fred
