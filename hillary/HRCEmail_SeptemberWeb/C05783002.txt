Subject: Govt in Haiti officially forms with deputy vote (AP)

PORT-AU-PRINCE (AP) - Haiti is finally operating under a fully staffed government almost a year after
national elections were held.
  The Chamber of Deputies approved a 17-member Cabinet and the policy agenda of Prime Minister Garry
Conille on Saturday morning.
  There were 81 favorable votes and seven abstentions in a hearing that lasted 14 hours.
  The vote comes five months after musician Michel Martelly was sworn in as president and a week after
Conille was approved as prime minister.
  The delay in establishing a formal government has slowed reconstruction following last year's devastating
earthquake.
