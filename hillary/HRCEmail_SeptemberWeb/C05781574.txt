Subject: U.S. House passes $900 billion debt limit increase (Reuters)

WASHINGTON9 (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives Friday passed Republican legislation
providing a short-term, $900 billion increase in the nation's borrowing limit by 218-210 votes.

   The legislation, which also contains $917 billion in spending cuts over a decade, now goes to the Senate.
Democrats who control that chamber vow to block it in favor of a longer-term $2.5 trillion debt limit increase
with about $2.2 trillion in spending cuts.
