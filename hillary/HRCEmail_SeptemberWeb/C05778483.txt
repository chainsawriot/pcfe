it snowed a lot overnight ay my house and is still coming down so I think we will have to check on the shuttles during the
 day and also reserve on the later ones tonight and the 6 or 7am tomorrow as we learn more thruout the day. We should
 also look at the train just in case. It is however very beautiful!
