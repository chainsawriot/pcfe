Status update on the Chris Stevens mission to Benghazi:

The current game plan is for Mr. Stevens to move no later than Wednesday from Malta to Benghazi. He will stage off
shore initially for a one day visit during which he will have meetings with TNC interlocutors and get a sense of the
situation on the ground. The goal of this one day trip is for him to lay the groundwork for a stay of up to 30 days.

He will be accompanied by a DS team, a staff member from Embassy Tripoli and the leader of USAID's DART team. With
the support of Ambassador Cretz and Embassy Tripoli, Mr Stevens is in contact with INC members on the ground in
Benghazi and elsewhere; the team is also in contact with other diplomatic missions and NGOs in Benghazi. We expect to
get support in particular from the Turks who have a consulate in Benghazi.

Mr. Stevens team has been in touch with Africom planners on the details of the mission. We have made the official
request for support from OSD but have yet to get approval. Once we have that â€” and we hope that will be very soon --
we will be able to move forward with the planning.
