Subject: Brief readout of CSCC briefing on Hill today



Ambassador LeBaron and Diane Parsont spent a successful hour and a half with Paul Matulic,'a long-standing staffer for
the Senate Intelligence Committee, and the committee's deputy staff director, Lorenzo Goco.

They discussed the genesis of the CSCC, how it fits into the interagency process, and some ongoing projects. There
were no surprises, and no detailed questions about budget, staffing pattern or other quotidian matters. Instead, the
conversation focused on strategy and tactics.

Paul, whom I've known for a few years, is a straight-shooter and a strong PD supporter. More than once during the
meeting he indicated how glad he is that the CSCC is a reality, and that he remembers well the testimony that Judith
gave to his committee that included plans for CVE. He wrote afterward, "Ambassador LeBaron conveyed a very solid
sense of mission in a realistic world. Lorenzo and I were impressed."
