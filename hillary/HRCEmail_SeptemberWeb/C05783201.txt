Subject: African Union finally recognises Libya's NTC (Reuters)

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - The African Union (AU) recognised the National Transitional Council (NTC) as
Libya's de facto government September 20, removing another piece of diplomatic support for ousted leader
Muammar Gaddafi.

   The pan-African body, which has frequently been criticised for its ponderous reaction to events on its
doorstep, said in a statement it was ready to support the NTC in its efforts to build an inclusive government.

   It also urged the NTC to protect African migrant workers following reports of black Africans being targeted
by militia units hunting down mercenaries loyal to Gaddafi.
