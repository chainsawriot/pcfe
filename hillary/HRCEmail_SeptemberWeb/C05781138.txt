Facebook hires Joe Lockhart

SAN FRANCISCO — Joe Lockhart, who helped build the press office during the second
Clinton term in the White House, is joining Facebook.

A former TV reporter, Lockhart joins Facebook as vice president of communications and
will manage the company's corporate, policy and international communications team. He
starts July 15 joining the social networking firm at a time when the company has found
itself under increasing scrutiny over privacy concerns.

"Joe's arrival brings new skills and greater depth to our incredibly busy team," said Elliot
Schrage, Facebook's vice president of global communications, marketing and public
policy.

"His experience building and running a press office at the White House gives him
particular appreciation for the demands of a global 24-hour news cycle and the challenges
of responding effectively to intense scrutiny," Schrage said. "His experience launching and
scaling a communications firm will help us as we seek to build our team and continue to
offer great opportunities for growth and professional development."

Lockhart has deep ties to Washington and is a veteran of political campaigns such as
Sen. John Kerry's 2004 bid, the 1988 Dukakis-Bentsen campaign, the 1984 Mondale-
Ferraro campaign and former President Jimmy Carter's reelection bid in 1980.

In 2001, he founded the Glover Park Group, an independent communications firm in D.C.
and New York. There, as managing partner, he has represented companies such as Visa,
Microsoft and Yahoo among others.
