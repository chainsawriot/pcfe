Subject: Rebels say Gaddafi forces attacking town of Zintan (Reuters)

ALGIERS (Reuters) - Forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi are trying to advance on the rebel-held
town of Zintan, southwest of the capital, and are bombarding it with rockets, a rebel spokesman said on Sunday.

  "The military is now trying to advance from the east. They have been randomly bombarding the town with
Grad (rockets) and mortars since the early hours of this morning," the spokesman, called Abdulrahman, told
Reuters by telephone from Zintan.

   "There is also fighting in the al-Rayayna area (to the east of Zintan). We have been fighting them there since
this morning."
