Subject: S/Davutoglu/Istanbul

Jake - just passing a message from Marc - we see S is meeting Davutoglu this morning at 1030. We know
Afghanistan/Istanbul conference is on the BCL but way down the list. Would it be possible at least for S to say thanks to
the Turks for all their work on it, our teams are in contact, and she hopes to see him there (if she's decided to go), as a
courtesy point? She'll also see Davutoglu Thursday at the New Silk Road event. Thanks very much.
