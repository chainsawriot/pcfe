P proposing you put out the below based on bombing in Iran today. Thoughts?

For Immediate Release September 22, 2010

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON

Explosion in Mahabad, Iran

I condemn the bombing targeting Iranians attending a parade in Mahabad today. The United States deplores this
senseless loss of life and extends its sympathy to the families and loved ones of those injured and killed. We also call for
the perpetrators of this horrific attack to be held accountable for their actions.

The United States condemns terrorism and all forms violence against innocent people, wherever it occurs, and stands
with the victims of these appalling acts. This attack underscores the global community's need to work together to
combat terrorist organizations that threaten the lives of innocent civilians all around the world.
