Thanks! It's a K-8 school but he's bringing some of the middle-schoolers.

I'd be happy to? How old are they?

My little brother Andy                                                             is
bringing 40-odd students to DC next week. I'm going to take them around the State
Department Tuesday afternoon - I was hoping to impose on you for like 15 minutes to take a
few questions from them. We'd assemble them in the Treaty Room. If you're amenable,
Lona says she can figure it out....
