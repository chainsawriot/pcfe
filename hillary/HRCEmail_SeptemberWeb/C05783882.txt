Dear Hillary
Another important trip. I know you have a ton on your mind and a big agenda in Turkey. Nevertheless, if you have a
chance to mention PNB in your meetings or to the press it would be a great boost. You may remember at the dinner you
hosted, the Turkish local chapter was really on its way. The head of it is Rifat Hisarciklioglu,President of TOBB (business
trade assocY

Here's to you good buddy
Madeleine
