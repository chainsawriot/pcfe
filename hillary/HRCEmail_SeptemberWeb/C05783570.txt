   USAID, the Government of Norway, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Grand
   Challenges Canada and The World Bank invite you to Saving Lives at Birth's
   DevelopmentxChange. Last March, the Saving Lives at Birth program called upon the
   brightest minds across the globe to identify and scale up transformative prevention
   and treatment approaches for pregnant women and newborns in rural, low resource
   settings around the time of birth. More than 600 innovators responded to our call.
    The DevelopmentxChange is a key feature of the Saving Lives at Birth program and
    serves as the first step in building a community of innovators to tackle this challenge.
    • Meet and get inspired by the 75 Saving Lives at Birth finalists who have come
      to Washington, D.C. to participate in the final stage of the competition.
   • Explore their innovations in an open marketplace and help build this growing
     community of innovators.
