                                     BUSINESS LEADERS TO CONGRESS:

                      SUPPORT A STRONG & EFFECTIVE INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS BUDGET


   June 29, 2011



   Dear Member of Congress:

   In order to spur economic growth and create jobs here in the U.S., our nation must remain
   competitive in an increasingly interconnected global economy and continue to build new
   markets for American goods and services. That is why we are writing to urge your support
   for a strong and effective International Affairs Budget.

   U.S. businesses understand that international development and diplomacy programs play a
   vital role in creating American jobs and spurring U.S. economic growth. Although just over
   1% of the federal budget, International Affairs programs are critical to creating new and
   stable markets for American goods and services, expanding U.S. exports, and protecting
   intellectual property rights. American businesses and entrepreneurs — large and small —
   benefit significantly from programs in the International Affairs Budget that provide
   technical assistance, identify business opportunities, and help developing countries
   become more reliable trading partners.

    In many ways, the International Affairs Budget is America's "toolbox" for trade. Today,
    more than ever, U.S. economic growth is linked with global trade and the global economy.
    Trade has tripled as a share of the U.S. economy in the last four decades, with more than 1
    out of 5 American jobs tied to international trade. America's fastest growing markets —
    representing roughly half of U.S. exports — are located in developing countries. Export
    promotion programs funded by the International Affairs Budget are essential to expanding
    U.S. trade in these emerging markets.

    The International Affairs Budget funds valuable tools for advancing U.S. economic and
    strategic interests around the world and is vital for achieving a more prosperous future for
    American workers and businesses. While we recognize the very real budget constraints
    that exist, we urge you to support a strong and effective International Affairs Budget.

    Sincerely,




    Bill Lane                                John Murphy
