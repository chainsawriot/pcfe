Subject: Rebel council to take Libya's seat at Arab League (Reuters)

CAIRO (Reuters) - The Arab League gave its full backing to Libya's rebel National Transitional Council (NTC)
as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people August 25 and said it was time for Libya to take back its
permanent seat on the League's council.

   "We agreed that it is time for Libya to take back its legitimate seat and place at the Arab League. The NTC
will be the legitimate representative of the Libyan state," the League's Secretary General Nabil Elaraby told
reporters in Cairo.

  The NTC's representative at the League, Abdelmoneim el-Houni, said Libya would resume its League
membership at a meeting of Arab ministers August 28.
