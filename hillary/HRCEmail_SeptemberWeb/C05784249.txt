Subject: QDDR Strategic Communications Plan

Hi Mike,

One of the most important components of successful QDDR implementation (as with all policy goals) will be a
strategic communications plan that supports it. In the run-up to the establishment of a formal QDDR
Implementation office, we've worked within S/ES to pull together a shell of how to communicate internally to
the Department featuring an intranet website which implementation leads would regularly update with status
reports on the progress they're making (initial thoughts attached here from Sounding Board chief Kerry
O'Connor). « Message: RE: QDDR Public Website »

In discussing this with Cheryl yesterday, Cheryl asked if you could please pull together an overarching strategic
communications plan for both internally to the Department as well as externally that we'll feed to the QDDR
office when it stands up (we hope soon).

I'd be happy to meet with you and your team to provide any additional background you need about the QDDR,
but for your early information, I attach the memo the Secretary sent to the building on this in April.

Thanks,

Steve
