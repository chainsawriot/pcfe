                                                                                             RELEASE IN FULL




                              Sitrep 1: 0900 Reporting, Embassy Port-au-Prince


Key Points:
     •   At least 40 voting centers in Port-au-Prince did not receive correct materials or did not receive
         materials on time. Was a MINUSTAH error and they are working to get materials out. Haitian
         radio media are reporting on this.
     •   Crowds gathered outside a couple of voting centers in Port-au-Prince chanting and demanding
         right to vote; many appear to be Martelly supporters.
    •    In Verettes, in the Artibonite department, embassy team reports tension inside voting center,
         fistfights, and inadequate HNP staffing.
     •   In other departments, many voting centers are opening late, but otherwise the process
         appears calm.
     •   OAS reports voter turnout appears higher than on November 28th, and outside of Port-au-
         Prince, the voting process appears to be going smoothly.


 Media Reporting 0900:

 Numerous Haitian radio stations reporting on lack of supplies, including ballots, ballot boxes, and ink.
 Radio Kiskeya now attributing these problems to MINUSTAH. Crowds have been described as patient,
though at some sites, anger does appear to be rising at delays. Media have not reported much on
 problems with voter lists.

 Radio Caraibes reports that in Martissant, two observers inside the voting center are directing people to
 vote for Martelly.

 International correspondents, through their Twitter feeds, are tracking the same stories.



 Port-au-Prince Area:

 Several polling stations remained unopen in the Port-au-Prince area, causing frustrations for voters.
 MINUSTAH delivered insufficient ballot boxes and materials to about 40 voting centers around the
 capital.

 In and around the Champs-de-Mars IDP camp, voting had yet to start at 0800 because of undelivered
 ballots and voting materials. MINUSTAH was expected to deliver the remaining materials. Similar
 problems were reported in Kafou Fey and Laboule.

 In Petionville, votes for president and deputy are being cast in the same ballot box at several polling
 stations. One of the larger voting center (Lycee Petionville) delayed opening due to missing materials,
 causing frustrations with voters (apparently mostly pro-Martelly).

 Observers noted voters often had little privacy when casting ballots.

Voting center in Pacot not open yet, large crowds outside demanding the right to vote.

17'1-




Artibonite


St Marc:
Ecole Antoinette Dessalines opened at 6:00. Voters began arriving around 6:15; first vote at 6:35.
Everything set up by 6:45, supervisor making rounds. Relaxed environment, not a large number of
voters yet. Voters are finding their names on the list; some are voting before signing off on voter list.


Verettes:
-Ecole Nationale Charles Belair — opened at 6:00; voters allowed to enter at 7:20. MINUSTAH contingent
from Argentina in place. In general embassy team observed a climate of dispute and tension
characterized by animated arguments between party partisans and poll workers and voters. Voters
came to fisticuffs within minutes of polls opening - these individuals were escorted outside. In BV 14
Proces verbal filled out incorrectly - resolved by CV president thought the collective writing of a memo.
In BV9 observed a dispute over presence of 2 party observers from same candidate and party,
successfully resolve with peaceable removal of 2nd observer by president of CV.
-BV Central: There are only 2 or 3 policemen and MINUSTAH says there should be more. The police say
they do not have enough manpower to send others in here but they have roving patrols that are trying
to cover the BVs. Many people are not finding their names on the lists and they are angry. Someone
voted several times. He washed his thumb between votes at least 3 times. Lines of voters waiting in
line outside BV because persons who already voted remain in BV not permitting others in. This prevents
police from allowing others into CV and tensions among voters seem high as wait time grows.

they did open, so they had to close their doors and have voters wait outside.
