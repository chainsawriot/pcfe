CAIRO - (AP) Egyptian airport officials say the Israeli ambassador is at Cairo's airport waiting for a military
plane to evacuate him from the country after protesters broke into Israel's Embassy.
   The officials say other Israelis were also waiting for the evacuation flight to take them back to Israel early
Saturday. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the
