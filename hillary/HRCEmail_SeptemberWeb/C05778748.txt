RABAT (Reuters) - Morocco's King Mohammed said he will not cede to "demagoguery" a day after thousands
of Moroccans took to the street to demand he gives up some of his powers to a newly elected government.

   The monarch, speaking after he chaired a ceremony for long-awaited appointments of members of a Social
and Economic Council, said that building an effective democracy should go hand in hand with sustainable
human development.

    The remarks were carried by the official MAP news agency.
