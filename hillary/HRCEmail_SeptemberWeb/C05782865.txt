Hi Huma: I'd   be grateful if you'd pass this note to the Secretary. Best, Eric

Madam Secretary:

Many thanks, again, for your participation in the refugee consultations. I believe they went
very well.

I want to clarify one issue you discussed on the Senate side, as I don't want you to have the
wrong idea about the Government of Nepal on the issue of Bhutanese.




 Again, many thanks for your engagement on these issues.

 Best,
