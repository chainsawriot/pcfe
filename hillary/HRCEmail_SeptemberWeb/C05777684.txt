Subject: Israel: Decision expected soon on FM indictment (AP)

JERUSALEM (AP) - Israeli media are reporting authorities will decide by the end of February whether to indict
the country's foreign minister on corruption charges. A decision to prosecute Avigdor Lieberman would shake
up Israeli politics. Lieberman said he will resign if indicted. His departure could mean a steep drop in support
for his hard-line party, built largely on his personal popularity. The Israeli papers Haaretz and Maariv reported
an assistant to the attorney general sent a letter to the good-governance group Ometz saying a decision would be
made by the end of next month. The decision follows a decade-old investigation into Lieberman's business
dealings, involving suspicions of bribery, breach of trust and other allegations.
