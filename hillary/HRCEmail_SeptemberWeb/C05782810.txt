Subject: EU expands sanctions against Iran (AP)



BRUSSELS (AP) - The European Union has expanded sanctions against Iran because of continued human
rights abuses.
   A meeting of EU foreign ministers added 29 officials linked to the regime of President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad to the list of people facing a visa ban and asset freeze.
   British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Monday the measures were enforced to increase "the pressure
on Iran to improve its appalling human rights record."
   The EU says human rights abuses have increased over the past weeks and months, including the execution of
minors. It also calls for more religious freedom and an end of repression of the political opposition.
