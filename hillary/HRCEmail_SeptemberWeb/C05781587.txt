Subject: AFGHAN COURT FINDS FRAUD IN PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION (SBU)

(SBU) A special tribunal appointed by President Karzai announced it recommends overturning approximately
25 percent of the September 2010 election results after finding widespread fraud, putting into question control
of parliament, according to press. Embassy Kabul comments the court's findings have been turned over to the
Afghan Attorney General who will determine next steps. The court's announcement is only a
recommendation. There are different estimates on the number of affected seats. Post estimates it likely will be
around 60, involving 33 of the 34 provinces.
