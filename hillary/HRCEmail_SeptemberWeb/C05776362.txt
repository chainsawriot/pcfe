I think the article is headed in the right direction but I agree w you that the points you mention should be referenced.
Are you getting comments from others? Should I wait for the next draft to comment?

Thanks for your nice words. They mean a lot. I will always, always play for your team, officially or not!

Many more thoughts on sports diplomacy that I'm excited about. And yes, once a jock, now an aging jock!

On QDDR article, you'll see that a lot is missing (most notably a section on the Middle East, as well as China, Western
Hemisphere (we should probably mention ECPA), a good energy example per David Goldwyn, et. a!). it may also be too
Pakistan heavy, though it is a great example of everything we are trying to do. My main goal was to try to ground the
many elements at play in a more coherent narrative with a theme and thread that carried through. Didn't have enough
time on the bottom third. Hopefully this version gives us something to work with, though.

And I really hope you get some semblance of time off this week. If only the world would, for once, cooperate.
