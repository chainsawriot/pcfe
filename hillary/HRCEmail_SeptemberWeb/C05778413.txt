Sujay,

As we suspected might happen, your nomination was held over at this afternoon SFRC business
meeting. We can discuss next steps, but my initial reaction is that we should keep the DeMint meeting
scheduled for later this week. Hopefully we can allay any concerns he and his staff might have at that
meeting.

Thanks.

Sujay,

As we discussed on Friday afternoon, the strategy for dealing with the Senate requires us to go one step
at a time.

Your nomination is on the agenda for the SFRC business meeting tomorrow afternoon. We'll know coming
out of that meeting whether there is a request to hold your nomination over. If there is such a request -
and by rule any member of the committee is entitled to exercise their prerogative to hold a nomination
over - then it becomes very unlikely that you will be confirmed prior to adjournment of the 111th
Congress.

 As we discussed last week, let's make time tomorrow evening to discuss where things stand.

Subject: Good morning:


I hope you are well. Thanks for the copies of all materials sent to me for the DeMint meeting later this week. If there are
any updates on any countries, especially China, N. Korea , Afghanistan, Iraq & Iran, please let me know. Also, with
Special Envoy Holbrook's illness, what affect that will have on our office's relationship with Afghanistan?. I am confident of
my presentation and representation for the meeting.

Since before we get to the meeting, we have the Committee calendar date to get through, I needed clarification of what
strategy we are putting in place to counter what might occur with Senator DeMint, since this is the final week before
recess and my nomination would expire if not confirmed during this session..

I don't know if you had seen this resolution below which came out right about the same time I met with the Senator's
staffers in July and when Peter Koviach was director of the office. You may recall Sen DeMint was the was the first
"courtesy call" and we had not heard anything from his office until last week. This resolution is from a very conservative
group with which he is familiar and there are other conservative clergy colleagues who have wanted to weigh in for some
time and show their support,( from the National Clergy Coalition), many from his own state, but there was no avenue
during the vetting process, and they respected the process.. Might this be a good time to send over the resolution to his
office and/or have clergy contact him?

Also, as you know, my Senators from NY State, Sen. Schumer and Sen Gillibrand have offered to help in any way you
feel would be helpful. Earlier before the Hearing date was set, Sen Hatch also offered his assistance. I understand his
office did help with securing a Hearing date.
The author of the resolution was helpful in making that introduction, and Sen Hatch was the only Senator to personally
meet with me.

I seek your guidance. In the meantime, I am fully prepared for the meeting on Thursday and will continue to re-visit the
information and materials sent. I am ready.

Thanks for your time and attention

Suzan Johnson Cook ( Sujay)
