N.Y. lawmakers: Give victims bounty

Two New York congressmen want to see the federal government's reward money for Osama bin
Laden's capture go to groups that support first responders, survivors and family members of those
killed in the Sept. 11 attacks.

At a press conference Sunday at the World Trade Center site in lower Manhattan, Democratic Reps.
Anthony Weiner and Jerry Nadler, whose district includes Ground Zero, introduced a bill that would
direct up to $50 million intended to be a bounty for bin Laden to groups that have helped those
affected move on with their lives.

Since bin Laden's capture appears to be the product of official intelligence efforts, reports have
suggested that the reward may not be paid out.

"If the bounty isn't paid, Osama bin Laden's victims should get it," Weiner said.

Instead, Weiner said, "families and groups who helped deal with survivors of 9/11" should "benefit."
Nadler added that the money "was allocated for 9/11 victims in effect, and this is simply, saying use it
more effectively for the purpose that it was set up in the first place."

The State Department offered up a $25 million bounty for bin Laden in 2001, and in 2004, then-Sen.
Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.) led the effort to pass a bill that would give the secretary of state the discretion
to raise that total to $50 million. Clinton, of course, is now secretary of state.

A State Department spokesman told CNN last week that "the department does not generally discuss
nominations for awards," and, "if it were paid, it could be less" than the maximum.
