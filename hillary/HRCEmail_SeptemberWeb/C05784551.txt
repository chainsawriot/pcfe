Cheryl, Kris

  If you have an opportunity pls. show this to Secretary Clinton. She will be pleased to
see that the Clinton Centre in Enniskillen is the venue for the June Board Meeting of
the International Fund for Ireland. Hopefully we can begin to use the Clinton Centre for
more international conferences and work with the Clinton Foundation in Arkansas to
share ideas. I will talk with DecIan about this.

Thanks

Stella
