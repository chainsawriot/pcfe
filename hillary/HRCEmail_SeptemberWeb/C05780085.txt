BERLIN, April 14 (Reuters) - NATO is committed to provide all necessary resources for military operations in
Libya, Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Thursday.

  "We are committed to provide all necessary resources and maximum operational flexibility within our
mandate. A high operational tempo against legitimate targets wil be maintained," he told a news conference at a
meeting of NATO foreign ministers.

  NATO would exert pressure for as long as necessary and until the forces of Libyan leader Muammar
Gaddafi halted attacks on civilians and withdrew to bases, he said.
