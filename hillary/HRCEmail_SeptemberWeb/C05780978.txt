Cheryl,

I had dinner last with Chris Coons. As you know, he is the chair of the Africa subcommittee at SFRC. He mentioned that
he only heard by happenstance of HRC's upcoming visit to Africa for the AGOA forum, and that no one had reached out
to him from State to let him know of the trip, or to invite him to consider attending. He is quite passionate about Africa
and development issues, and just returned from a Codel to the continent with Jonny lsaakson.

He also mentioned that at a recent event with a group of Senators, he was the only one whom HRC didn't recognize and
greet by name. (He reminded her that he was "the one who beat the witch.") â€¢

Chris is not a big-ego, high-maintenance guy, but he seemed a bit miffed as he described this.

Just an FYI for a chance for some relationship-building.
