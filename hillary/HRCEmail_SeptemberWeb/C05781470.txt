Subject: French court opens probe into Mubarak, Ben All (AP)


PARIS - (AP) A French judicial official says the Paris prosecutor's office has opened two judicial inquiries
into money laundering allegations against the ousted presidents of Egypt and Tunisia.
   The official says the inquiries are not exclusively focused on Egypt's Honsi Mubarak or Tunisia's Zine El
Abidine Ben Ali, thus allowing the investigating judges to examine the deposed leaders' entourage for evidence
of "money laundering in an organized group."
   The official says judicial inquiries were opened Tuesday. She was speaking Friday on condition of
anonymity, in accordance with French judicial regulations.
   Citizens' groups filed the complaints with the French court earlier this year, after Ben Ali and Mubarak were
toppled in popular uprisings.
