Spoke to Kusa again at 1100 Tunis time. Said we appreciate his help on ferry, which must depart without interference as
soon as weather allows. Said we also need help on use of mil airfield for commercial charter later today, and would
appreciate his follow up with Sanussi. He said he understood and there would be "no problem" with exit of Americans.

I then told him bluntly that the violence has to stop. We had known each other for more than a decade and I had always
tried to be straight with him. The situation is extremely serious, as President Obama made clear in his statement
yesterday. The violence has to stop.

Kusa, with a very grim and deflated air, said we didn't really understand the situation. Maybe I or others should come to
Tripoli and sit with him and we would understand better. I simply repeated that the violence has got to stop. We
understand pretty well the ugliness that is going on, and no one should underestimate our seriousness.

I closed by reemphasizing the importance of the ferry/ship issues. He again said he understood.

Pls pass to others. Am on way to see Bouteflika.

Bill
