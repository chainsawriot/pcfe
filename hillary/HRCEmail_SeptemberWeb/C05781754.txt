Subject: Trial of Mubarak's security chief resumes in Cairo (AP)


CAIRO (AP) - A day after the start of Hosni Mubarak's historic trial, seven of his co-defendants are back in the
courtroom on charges of ordering the killing of protesters during the uprising that toppled Egypt's longtime
president.
   Thursday's hearing of former Interior Minister Habib el-Adly and six top police officials is being broadcast
live on Egyptian state televisions.
   The seven appeared in court first on Wednesday in the same defendants' cage with Mubarak and his two sons
  one-time heir apparent Gamal and businessman Alan _ in a related case that is tried by the same judge. The
Mubaraks' trial resumes Aug. 15.
   Mubarak, el-Adly and the six police officials face the death penalty if convicted over the protesters' deaths.
   The three Mubaraks separately face corruption charges.
