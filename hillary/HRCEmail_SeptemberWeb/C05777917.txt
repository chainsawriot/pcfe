Thanks so much for the ride up yesterday. Sure beats the shuttle! I thought the speech was terrific. I asked the team to
be sure that it was translated and pushed out broadly. Also asked them to work over the w/e to put together video clips
of key messages, with sub-titles that can be pushed out using both traditional and social media in all key markets. I've
asked for a report back and will let you know how it goes.

Happy to report we have heat!! Just as well since the wind off the river is amazingly intense this morning â€”love it.

Hope you have a lovely NY weekend.
