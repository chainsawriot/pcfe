Supreme ct that just screwed us --- wow do I miss having u to talk to in. Uss--- let me say. YOU are doing a terrific job on
many fronts. Re. Haiti proud of both you and. President. Bill. --- this wk in caucus we were avolcano ready to erupt---real
frustration with. Pres white house team and tin ear/ thin plans to deal with. Deep. Economic. Anxiety. So. Bernake vote
became a way to send a message--- as I move around ( and I am.                                  . Middle class feels their
way of life. Slippingaway. And dems. Are only offering spending plans. Not solutions--- his. State of. Union has to be a.
Major. Rest button---- we can do this. Bill and you have lived thru similar travails. Hope to see you there and hope we
can connct soon.
