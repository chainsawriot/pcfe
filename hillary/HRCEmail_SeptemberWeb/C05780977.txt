Subject: China pushes Iran to return to talks (Reuters)



BEIJING (Reuters) - China's President Hu Jintao told his Iranian counterpart June 14 that six-nation talks were
the best way to guarantee Iran's right of peaceful use of nuclear energy on the eve of the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization meeting in Kazakhstan.

  Hu told President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, both in the central Asian country's capital Astana ahead of the
summit, that Iran should "take substantial steps" to establish trust and "promote the process of dialogue," state
news agency Xinhua said.

   "This is not only in the interest of the Iranian side, but also conducive to the general situation of peace and
stability in the Middle East region," Hu said.

   Last week China joined Western powers in telling Iran its "consistent failure" to comply with United Nations
resolutions "deepened concerns" about possible military dimensions to its nuclear programme.
