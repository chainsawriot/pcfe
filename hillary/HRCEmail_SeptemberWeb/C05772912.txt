I just had a long conversation with Tony about             Tony is very happy to help, although he made following points:        B5

--Best that a non-American take first crack.           trusts Tony, but he still smarts over his departure and holds that
against US.




--Fernandez is a possibility. (I told him Arturo would see F tomorrow).

--Tony happy to back up or join with a foreigner in conveying the message.

--As for the message, it should be positive, focusing on what   can achieve by staying out. (I told him we had
crafted points along those lines.)
