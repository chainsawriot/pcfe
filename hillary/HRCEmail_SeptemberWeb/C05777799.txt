I did a live tv interview today with Nik Gowing in which he actually asked me about the QDDR (he had heard my talk on
the QDDR at Chatham House this morning). Who would have thunk? I also managed to echo the theme of your china
speech last week and to emphasize that U.S. stands for the freedom to connect. In 3 minutes. The QDDR express has
done 6 talks in 3 cities in 2 days and many bilats -- almost looks like your schedule! EUCOM, AFRICOM, and Berlin
tomorrow. AM
