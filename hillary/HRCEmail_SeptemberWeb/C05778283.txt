Subject: Rice/AI Jazeera telcon with P

Former Secretary Rice called Bill to inquire where matters stood with the release of alleged Palestinian
negotiation documents by Al-Jazeerah, noting that she was saying nothing publicly. Bill described our public
posture (as per below). Rice said she would adhere to that approach. If matters deteriorated and she could say
something useful, Rice asked that we let S know that she was prepared to help, but that she would take her cue
from S. Bill thanked her for the offer and said that we would stay in touch. David/Jake, Bill asks that we keep
Rice's staff updated as appropriate. Thx,

     Palestinians: Release of Alleged Palestinian Negotiations Documents by Al-Jazeera


Q: What is the U.S. reaction to Al-Jazeera's release of alleged negotiations documents related
to Middle East peace efforts?

    • These are not U.S. documents. We cannot vouch for their veracity.

    • We do not plan to comment on any particular document.

   • None of this changes our understanding of what is at stake and what needs to be
     done. A framework agreement that resolves the core issues remains possible and
     necessary.


Q. Is this the nail in the coffin of peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians?

   • We remain committed to a two-state solution; we will continue to work with the
     parties to narrow existing gaps and work towards a framework agreement.

   • We have an important meeting of the Quartet next week and will redouble of efforts
     in the coming days.

   • We have been in touch with a variety of leaders in the region over the past 24 hours.
     Most of these calls were made by Special Envoy Mitchell and his Deputy David Hale
     to prepare for the Quartet meeting, but we have discussed the current situation.


Q. Does this make movement toward a resolution in New York more likely?

     • Our position has not changed. We do not believe New York is the right forum to
       resolve these issues.

Subject: al Jazeera "Palestine Papers" document leak -- initial analysis of documents posted

All:

As discussed earlier today, we've looked at the 16 purported Palestinian peace process documents posted by Al Jazeera
on its website; attached is an initial brief analysis/overview. Text is also pasted below for BB reading.

Director
NEA/IPA

                                           SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED

                                    Al-Jazeera's purported PA documents


       Al Jazeera announced it has almost 1,700 "confidential" documents related to Israeli-
       Palestinian peace efforts in its possession. It calls the documents the "Palestine Papers" and
       is airing 4 special broadcasts on the leaks. As far as we can determine, the documents appear
       to be authentic, but we cannot confirm that independently. So far, only sixteen of the
       purported documents, all in English, have been posted to Al Jazeera's website - with more
       certainly to come. Most are minutes and maps from Annapolis-era negotiating sessions
       (including the June 2008 trilateral meeting in which former Secretary Rice participated).
       None appear to be USG documents. So far the only document from the tenure of the current
       administration is a January 2010 session between D/SEMEP David Hale and Erekat.

    We believe that the leak of these documents will seriously damage the standing of the
    Palestinian leadership and complicate their ability to re-join a negotiating process. The
    documents that have been released so far reveal little of US negotiating strategy, but the
 , impact of their release on the Palestinians will harm US peace efforts.

       The likely source of these documents is a former staffer from Saeb Erekat's PLO
       Negotiation Affairs Department (NAD). The NAD's subordinate Negotiation Support Unit

 (NSU), a donor-financed office staffed mainly by international personnel, has undergone
 significant staffing changes over the past year, and several personnel left disillusioned by
 Erekat and his management of the office. According to NSU staff this evening (in strict
 confidence), they were already aware of a major breach of information security.

 Al Jazeera's website coverage - which so far focuses on purported concessions by the
 Palestinian side on the highly sensitive refugee and Jerusalem issues - and the combative
 interview of Erekat on Al Jazeera this evening, have led many of our Palestinian contacts to
 speculate that Erekat stands to lose the most from these disclosures. That said, we can
 anticipate that President Abbas will stand with Erekat, even as he suffers criticism as well.

 Israeli liabilities appear fewer in the current tranche of documents. Most of the details of
 former PM Olmert's offer have already appeared in the public domain (including in a speech
 Olmert gave in late 2010). However, then-FM and current opposition leader Livni may
 suffer fallout from the disclosure of her role in the Annapolis negotiations, in particular her
 discussion of Jerusalem issues with the Palestinian negotiating team.


1. Meeting Minutes: 1st Meeting on Territory
  March 12, 2008, King David Hotel, West Jerusalem

  • Palestinian: Dr. Samih Al-Abed, Khaled Elgindy, Nizar Farsakh
  • Israeli: Udi Dekel and Dani Tirza

   Palestinian and Israeli parties discussed parameters for discussions including
   language and understandings on territories and borders. Israeli side refused to
   engage on the basis of the 1967 line or to accept the principle of a swap.

2. Map: Israeli Proposal for Etzion Bloc
  March 30, 2008
   Likely Palestinian-produced map displaying purported Israeli offer for Gush
   Etzion settlement bloc. Some details on bypass roads and other modalities to
   facilitate Palestinian movement around/under Israeli controlled areas. No other
   identifying features or details on discussion.

3. Land Swap Proposal Map - 10.6% of West Bank

   April 7, 2008
  Likely Palestinian-produced map of purported Israeli proposal showing a land
  swap and settler evacuation representing 10.6% of West Bank. No other
  identifying features or details on discussion. Shows details on major settlements
  to be annexed and identifies areas of West Bank planned for evacuation,
  including all of the Hebron area settlements and all of the smaller settlements in
  the northern West Bank.



4. Meeting Summary: 5th Meeting on Territory

  April 7, 2008, King David Hotel, West Jerusalem

  • Palestinian: Dr. Samih Al-Abed, Azem Bishara, Khaled
    Elgindy, Nizar Farsakh and Fouad Hallak
  • Israeli: Udi Dekel, Dani Tirza, Leah Arad and Kamil Abu-Rukun

  Sides presented conflicting views on land swaps; Palestinian note-taker reported
  poor atmospherics and said Palestinians responded that Israeli presentation indicated
  a lack of good faith.


5. Land Swap Proposal Map - 1.5%

  April 8, 2008
  Likely a Palestinian proposal, although not identified as such (as are documents
  numbers 6 and 7).

6. Land Swap Proposal Map - 1.5% of West Bank

  April 8, 2008

7. Land Swap Proposal Map -2% of West Bank

  April 8, 2008

8. Maps: Israeli Proposals at Taba and Camp David II

  April 10, 2008
  Apparently Palestinian-produced comparative maps showing what purports to be
  Israeli positions on territory for both negotiations, with the Taba map
  representing a much scaled-back proposal for annexations.

9. Meeting Minutes: Borders with Erekat, Ourei and Livni
  May 4, 2008, King David Hotel, West Jerusalem

  • Palestinians side: Ahmad Qurei (Abu Ala') , Dr. Saeb Erekat, Dr.
    Samih al-Abed, Khaled Elgindi, Salah Ilayan, Zeinah Salahi
  • Israeli side: Tzipi Livni,Udi Dekel, Tal Becker, Dani Terza

  Abu Ala' seems to signal Palestinian willingness to compromise on refugees and
  Jerusalem. He discusses conditions for land swaps, including land swaps within
  parts of Jerusalem ("land in Jerusalem for land in Jerusalem"). He also notes that
  not all refugees will return to Israel: "The Palestinian state must have adequate
  land, capabilities and resources to absorb Palestinian refugees who do not prefer
  to return to Israel, and those who hope to return to Palestine."


10. Meeting Minutes: Post-Annapolis Plenary Session on Territory
  May 21, 2008 Inbal Hotel Jerusalem,

  • Palestinian: Ahmed Querei (Abu Ala'), Dr. Saeb Erekat (SE), Dr.
    Samih ii Abd (SIA), Khaled Elgindy (KE), Salah Elayan (SA),
    Zeinah Salahi (ZS)
  • Israeli: FM Tzipi Livni (TL), Tal Becker (TB), Udi Dekel (UD),
    Dany Tirza (DT)

  Following a discussion of news reports regarding Israel's decision to negotiate
  with Syria over the return of the Golan, the meeting focused primarily on the
  Israeli side presenting their assessment of the Palestinian land-swap proposals.
  Livni touches on sensitive issues of Jerusalem and withdrawal from Golan.

  TL: ....Jerusalem is not included [on our map] because it's not being discussed
  here, but clearly we know it has to be discussed.
  [News comes in of 286 new units to be tendered in Betar
  TL: We're giving up the Golan so we need more in Betar

11. Meeting Minutes: 8th Meeting on Territory
  May 29, 2008 Jerusalem, King David Hotel

  • Palestinian: Dr. Samih Al-Abed, Azem Bishara, Hala Rashed,
    Fouad Hallak, Nizar Farsakh
  • Israeli: Udi Dekel, Dani Tirza, Lea Arad, and Kamil Abu Rukun

12. Meeting Minutes: Trilateral - United States, Israel and Palestine

   June 15, 2008 Jerusalem, Inbal Hotel

   • American side: - Condoleeza Rice, David Welch, Eliot Abrams,
     Jamal Hilal
   • Palestinian side: - Ahmad Qurei (Abu Ala), Dr Saeb Erekat, Salah
     Ilayan
   • Israeli side: Tzipi Livni, Tal Becker, Udi Dekel

   Abu Ala on Jerusalem: We proposed that Israel annexes all settlements in
   Jerusalem except Jabal Abu Ghneim (Har Homa). This is the first time in history
   that we make such a proposition; we refused to do so in Camp David.

  Secretary Rice discounts the idea of an international peacekeeping force in a
  Palestinian state. Referring to Iraqi PM Maliki and Canada as "incapable" in the
  context of border control/security issues, she reportedly says: "I have full trust in
  Nouni Malki, Iraq's Prime Minister, but he is incapable. Canada has sincere
  desire but there came a time when Canada was incapable of controlling the
  borders."



13. Meeting Minutes: General Plenary Meeting - June 30, 2008
   June 30, 2008 West Jerusalem

   • Palestinian: Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala'), Dr. Saeb Erekat (SE), Salah
     Aleyan, Rami Dajani
   • Israeli: Tzipi Livni, Udi Dekel, Tal Becker

   Palestinian side tries to inject issue of Jerusalem into discussions; Israelis silent. At
   one point SE notes: It is no secret 1 that on our map we proposed we are offering you
   the biggest Yerushalayim in history. But we must talk about the concept of Al-Quds.

14. Summary of Ehud Olmert's "Package" Offer to Mahmoud

Abbas - August 31, 2008

  August 31, 2008

  This document purportedly summarizes PM Olmert's offer to Mahmud Abbas on
  territory, Jerusalem, refugees and security. Under the described agreement, Israel
  would annex 6.8% of the West Bank, and safe passage between Gaza and West Bank
  would be under Israeli sovereignty. Sovereignty over the Holy Basin would be
  delayed to a later stage. On refugees, Israel would acknowledge the suffering of—
  but not responsibility for — Palestinian refugees. No mention is made of
  security. Most of the details of former PM Olmert's offer have already appeared in
  the public domain (including in a speech Olmert gave in late 2010).

  November 4, 2009
  Palestinian projections of the pace of settlement growth.



16. Meeting Minutes: Saeb Erekat and David Hale
  January 15, 2010 Jericho, NAD

  • Palestinians: Dr Saeb Erekat (SE), Rami Dajani
  • US: David Hale (DH), Daniel Rubenstein, Rick Waters

  Some details of USG planning are exposed. Erekat expresses interest in opening
  a secret channel to the GOI:

  DH: Raise this with Molcho.
  SE: I will. I've tried to meet him before.
  DH: He's ready now.
  SE: I want to construct a channel so it doesn't go down in one day. We can't say
  we're resuming negotiations. We keep the channel secret. Use it to discuss our
  strategic relations. The priority is not to have collapse on the ground.
