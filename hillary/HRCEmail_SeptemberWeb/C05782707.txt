Dear Madame Secretary:

I hope you are well. I am very proud of your remarkable work. You may remember that during the Clinton
Administration I was Under Secretary of State for Economic, Business, and Agricultural Affairs and I was the chief U.S.
negotiator for the Kyoto Protocol. Todd Stern and Jonathan Pershing were key parts of my team.

I have been doing pro bono representation of a remarkable organization fronted by Jeff Horowitz, Avoided
Deforestation Partners, which combines many of the country's major environmental groups with a number of large
electric utility companies. We are dedicated to reducing the rate of global deforestation, which is a major contribution
to greater gas emissions. Tropical forests are also crucial as habitats for a majority of the world's species, and poor
people depend upon forests for their livelihood.

Our inspiration has been Wangari Maathai, with whom I worked daily. Her premature passing is a genuine tragedy. I
know you share my admiration for her.

I am attaching a letter from me and Jeff Horowitz asking that you agree to do a short video for an event at the Durban
COP, honoring Wangari and supporting forest preservation.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best wishes.

Stu Eizenstat
