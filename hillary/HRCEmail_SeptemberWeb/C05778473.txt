DERA ISMAIL KHAN (AP) - Pakistani intelligence officials say two suspected U.S. missile strikes have killed
seven militants in the country's tribal region.
   The two officials say the Sunday evening strikes also wounded five militants in Spalgah village near Miran
Shah in North Waziristan.
   They spoke on condition of anonymity in line with their agency's policy.
   The officials say two missiles first hit a vehicle and four more struck a compound; a Pakistani Taliban hide-
out.
   The tribal region is home to several militant groups focused on attacking U.S. and its allied NATO forces
across the border in Afghanistan.
   The Pakistani Taliban have also taken refuge there after an army offensive in their neighboring headquarters
of South Waziristan.
