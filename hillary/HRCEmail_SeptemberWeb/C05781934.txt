You had asked what the indictment has on Saif. Much of it is from before the revolution. But the basic thrust is this:
"Muammar Gaddafi issued orders to his subordinates integrated within the State structure, including Saif AI-Islam
Gaddafi and Abdullah Al-Senussi, who espoused and executed Muammar Gaddafi's plan which led to the commission of
the crimes described in the Application. Both Saif AI-Islam Gaddafi and Abdullah Al-Senussi control relevant parts of the
State apparatus and Security Forces: Saif AI-Islam Gaddafi, acting as Muammar Gaddafi's de facto prime minister and
exercising control over finances and logistics, and Abdullah Al-Senussi, acting as head of the Military Intelligence and
exercising control over certain security organs."

Put simply, the ICC demonstrates that Saif had control of the Security Apparatus and that the Security Apparatus
perpetrated criminal acts. They further demonstrate that he was aware of these acts. They therefore conclude that
there are reasonable grounds for an indictment.
