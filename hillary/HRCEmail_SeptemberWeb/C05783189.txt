Subject: Palestinians will submit UN membership letter (AP)

UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is pressing ahead today with his diplomatic
campaign to gain full membership in the U.N.
  There have been heated objections from Israel and a promised veto by the U.S. as world leaders gather for the
opening of the U.N. General Assembly session.
  Abbas has meetings scheduled for today with French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Lebanese President
Michel Suleiman as he tries to line up support ahead of his speech Friday to the General Assembly. That's when
the Palestinians have promised to submit a letter formally requesting U.N. membership.
   Meanwhile, representatives of the U.S., the U.N., the European Union and Russia plan to meet again today in
an effort to avert a divisive showdown over Palestinian statehood. The envoys of the Quartet of Mideast
mediators are trying to craft a way to persuade the Palestinians to drop their bid and have enough reassurances
for Israel to give its support.
