The Worst Place on Earth to be a Woman

"The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is a beautiful, lush country, with fertile soil and rich minerals. But it has
suffered from an ongoing civil war that is fueled by greed and corruption and inflamed by outside forces that exploit the
DRC's natural resources at the expense of the Congolese people.... In addition, thousands of women and girls have been
brutally raped as soldiers use women's bodies as a battlefield, where the goal is to destroy the stability of a village by
destroying the bodies and spirits of its women. While rape has often been used as a weapon of war, never has it been
used as freely and brutally as in the DRC."
-- Lynne Hybels
