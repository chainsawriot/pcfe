What do you know about Louise Diamond? And I agree w you about the potential of the Arc idea. Who at RAND is
responsible for it?

Subject: Psychology and Middle East Peace

I have not been able to get a psychology dinner set up, but I have found the article that you read on the difference an
apology can make in the Middle East (coming in next email) and commissioned a useful paper from Louise Diamond, an
expert on psychology and negotiations who has done a lot of work between the Israels and the Palestinians herself
(attached). It's about 5 pages; I really think it is worth a read. Finally, on changing the frame to look forward, I strongly
recommend that you spend 8 minutes to look at a video produced by a Rand study called The Arc, which proposes a
high-speed road/rail project connecting the key cities in the West Bank and Gaza. It is a powerful, powerful vision of
what could be, one that will play right into Bibi's emphasis on economic growth. For my money, it would be worth a
private 8 minutes screening. I will send the link in the next email.
