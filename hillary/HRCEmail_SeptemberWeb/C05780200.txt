   •    Outside of Port-au-Prince, voting is proceeding without major problems. OAS observers report that voter
        turnout appears to be higher than on November 28th, and there are fewer reports of problems with poll station
        openings.

   •    The main concern is in Port-au-Prince, where at least 40 voting centers either received the wrong materials or
        did not receive materials on time. MINUSTAH is working to resolve, and post estimated that approximately half
        of these cases have been addressed. Please refer to the attached sitrep from post for further details.

   •    All 200 OAS observers are reportedly deployed and in place.

   •    Colin Granderson told AFP he found some irregularities in the electoral process in Port-au-Prince, stating that in
        Croix-des-Bouquets some members of the polling stations arrived late and at least one voting center did not
        open on schedule. There have also been reports of a lack of indelible ink in some polling stations; Granderson
        asked the CEP to look into this.

   •    Martelly was scheduled to vote at 9:45 at Petionville Lycee (where some of the late openings were reported);
        Manigat at 10:00 in Delmas.

   •    With the exception of Congresswoman Maxine Waters, STAFFDEL arrived safely in Haiti. Congresswoman
        Waters reportedly could not find a flight from LA, and therefore is not going to Haiti today.

   •    There are no further details on the circumstances surrounding Wyclef Jean's shooting. Jean refused to talk with
        police.

   •    There have been no new reports from the press on Aristide, or further statements from Aristide.

   •    The next call with post is scheduled for 12:00.
