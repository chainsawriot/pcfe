As feared, the CEP, using the contestations, gave inite an absolute majority of the Chamber of Deputies, with 52 or 53
seats of the 99-member body (to be ascertained in the morning):

Flagrant reversals from the preliminary results include a Centre Department Senate candidate, Delacruz Francisco of the
opposition party Alternative, who had placed 1st with 34,622 votes, but somehow lost to the third place mite candidate
Francois Bazelais, who garnered 20,920 votes (the Centre Department had 2 open Senate seats). mite thus controls the
Senate with 18 Senators of the 30 (to be confirmed in the morning).

As for the Chamber of Deputies, likewise, the CEP overturned two alternative candidates' victories in favor of lnite
contenders.

          has not returned calls.                                                                                         B1

Results have not yet been announced; it is unclear if the CEP will bow to pressure/payments. Pierre did speak with
         earlier and he claimed very few changes would occur.                                                             B1

Sorry!

I am saying they faced pressure, on the one hand, to maintain the preliminaries; on the other hand, to overturn some
prelimanary results, mostly in the Chamber of Deputies, to increase lnite's numbers. The latter outcome would increase
Inite's bargaining power in negotiations with president-elect MadeIly in the make-up of the new government, chiefly the
choice of a PM.

Hope this clears it.

Too short-hand -are you saying they are overturning things to give INITE a bigger victor in one of the
houses?

CEP members are discussing the results prior to announcement. Delay due to pressure by opposition candidates and
political parties I) to confirm preliminary results; and 2) mite to overturn some preliminary results to favor its candidates.

Stay tuned.

Dear colleagues,



         UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05781656 Date: 09/30/2015
      UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05781656 Date: 09/30/2015



As instructed, I discussed the definitive second round results with            I stressed that the     B1
USG hoped that the definitive results would reflect the will of the majority of voters, and that it    1.4(D)
would be problematic if the CEP changed any results due to political pressure whether from the
ruling or opposition political parties.

His reaction:

   1. Of the 68 contestations lodged by losing candidates, most, if not all of the preliminary results
      would not change, despite heavy pressure from ruling party leaders to overturn some of them
      to ensure a majority, particularly in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies (CoD) - the
      ruling party won 33 CoD seats, and would need 17 for an absolute majority;

   2. Though the CEP will publish the results later this evening,            laimed he had not seen B1
      some of the rulings ; nevertheless, he would ensure that where the tnbunal ruled to overturn 1 .4(D)
      preliminary results, this was done in strict compliance with the law. Accordingly, he will keep
      Post informed of the outcome of the contested results prior to the announcement;

   3. CEP members are aware of the apprehension of candidates and political parties, and is
      committed to an outcome that respects the letter and spirit of the Electoral Law.

Many cheers!
