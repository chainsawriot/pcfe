As you may have seen, I spoke to him today. Tomorrow, if she agrees, I think S should encourage him to come here (and
share my fun!). He is not perceived as anti-Shia. He is running to be president of Egypt, meaning he's neither going to
want to have bad relations with the GCC nor going to want to be seen as selling out another country's revolution. And
whatever else he may be, he's smart. I'd love to be working with him here right now. S can remind him that he and I
worked well together on Lebanon, and encourage him to come here while I'm still here. I also think the more non-GCC
visitors we can get here, the better behaved the Bahrainis (and Saudis) will have to be.
