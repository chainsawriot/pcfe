Subject: Arab League Statement on Syria

Colleagues:

Please see below a translated Arab League statement from Secretary General Nabil Al-Araby on Syria, compliments of
Embassy Cairo. Al-Araby called on Syrian authorities to halt immediately all violent operations and security campaigns
against civilians and to implement quickly reform measures. Embassy Cairo comments the statement represents a shift
from the carefully neutral stance Al-Araby took during his visit to Damascus in July.

Dr. Nabil Al-Araby calls upon Syrian authorities to immediately stop all kinds of violent operations and security
campaigns against civilians and quickly implement reform steps

Arab League Secretary General expressed his increased concern and extreme disturbance because of the deterioration
of the security situation in Syria due to the escalation in violence and military operations in Hama and Deir El Zour and
different parts of Syria, which led to the fall of tens of civilian victims and the destructions of many public and private
facilities.

Al-Araby said the opportunity still prevails to achieve the reforms announced by President Bashar al-Assad in response
to the aspirations of the Syrian people and their legitimate demands for freedom, and change, and achieving political
reforms.

Al-Araby called upon the Syrian authorities to immediately stop all the violent and security operations and quickly take
the necessary steps in this direction to preserve the national unity of the Syrian people, and to stop the bloodshed of
civilians and military, and to stop foreign interventions.

He also called upon the government, and all Syrian national powers to take the necessary steps to prepare the
environment for a serious involvement in a comprehensive national dialogue. He also expressed the readiness of the
Arab League to help in this direction to exit the crisis facing Syria.

Al-Araby emphasized such a comprehensive national dialogue is the only solution that guarantees the peaceful transfer
to stability that allows implementing the program for desired political reforms in a secure and stable environment that
allows the Syrians freedom of expression for their choices and ambitions, and that preserves for Syria its position and
focal and national role in the region.

Al-Araby warned against the dangers of stepping towards ethnic sedition and chaos in Syria, because this will have
destructive results on high interests of Syrian people and on the security and stability of the entire region.

Al-Araby called upon the Syrian government to form a neutral judicial team to investigate the acts of violence and
violations against human rights in Syria.

He emphasized also the Arab League according to its accord, refuses foreign interventions in internal affairs of Arab
countries and cares for the safety and security of its member countries and their political stability.
