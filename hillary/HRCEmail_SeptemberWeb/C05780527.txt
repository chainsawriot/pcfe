Subject: Two die from bullet wounds after Egypt protest-sources (Reuters)

CAIRO (Reuters) - Two men died from bullet wounds in central Cairo after the army tried to disperse protesters
overnight, two medical sources said on Saturday, although the army denied firing any live rounds.

    The sources at a Cairo hospital said the two were among 15 who were injured by shots.

  The sound of gunshots rang out across the area around Tahrir Square in Cairo overnight. Protesters said the
army had fired shots in the air. It was not clear if there were other armed people in the square when the shots
were fired.

   An army spokesman denied the report to Reuters, saying the army fired blanks, not live rounds to warn
protesters. The army had said in an earlier statement that it had "confronted acts of rioting and implemented a
curfew" without loss of life.

   On Saturday, several protesters said some of their number were injured and killed in the clashes. One pointed
to a pool of blood in the square.
