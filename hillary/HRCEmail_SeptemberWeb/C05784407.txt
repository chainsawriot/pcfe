Musical Selections: The hymn "Jerusalem" by William Blake and the traditional "Greensleeves." Such well-known hymns
as "Love Divine All Love Excelling" and "Guide Me 0 Though Great Redeemer" — better known in modern Britain as the
Welsh rugby anthem "Bread of Heaven" — are also on the schedule. The bride will walk down the aisle to the choral
anthem "I Was Glad" by Sir Charles Hubert Hastings Parry, composed for the coronation of William's great-great-great
grandfather Edward VII at Westminster Abbey in 1902.

.The program also provides the wording to the couple's vows. Kate, like Princess Diana in her wedding to Prince Charles
 in 1981, will not promise to obey her husband. Instead she will vow to "love, comfort, honor and keep" William.
 Because only Kate will wear a wedding ring, only William will say "With this ring I thee wed" as he slips the band on his
 bride's finger.

7:15 a.m.: The carriage procession of the bride and groom with a captain's escort of the Household Cavalry, followed by
the queen's procession with a sovereign's escort of the Household Cavalry, leaves the abbey for Buckingham Palace. The

8:30 a.m.: Fly-past by the Royal Air Force and Battle of Britain Memorial Flight.
