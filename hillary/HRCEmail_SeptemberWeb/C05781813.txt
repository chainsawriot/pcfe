  ACTION MEMO FOR THE SECRETARY

  FROM:         S/P — Jake Sullivan

  SUBJECT: Establishment of a Foreign Affairs Policy Board

  Recommendation

         That you approve sending the attached draft charter and membership balance
  plan to GSA, which will initiate the process of establishing a Foreign Affairs
  Policy Board.

         Approve                        Disapprove

         Pursuant to the provisions of Public Law 92-463, "Federal Advisory
  Committee Act," I am proposing to establish a Foreign Affairs Policy Board for the
  purpose of advising you on foreign policy issues. While its primary task will be to
  provide independent advice on longer range strategic planning, it will also
  undertake tasks of analysis into issues of particular concern to you, the Deputy
  Secretaries and me. I would expect it to provide high-level insight into and
  recommendations on major global trends, American strategic priorities, emerging
  threats and opportunities, and discrete policy questions that are significant and
  timely.

         The Board, comprised of up to twenty-five distinguished citizens from the
  private sector, nongovernmental organizations, think tanks and academia, will
  provide us with a fresh perspective and insight apart from, and independent of the
  State Department organization. It will not perform the function of any existing
  Department staff or committee.

        The Board's membership will be balanced to represent different points of
  view as required by Public Law 92-463.

         The Board's annual operating costs are estimated to be $132,500 for member
  travel, fees and administrative expenses.

        A Charter and Membership Balance Plan for the Board are attached to this
  memorandum. Upon your approval, both will be forwarded to GSA, which must
  approve the establishment of all discretionary advisory committees. After GSA
  approves the charter and balance plan, they will be forwarded to Under Secretary
  Kennedy for his formal approval.
