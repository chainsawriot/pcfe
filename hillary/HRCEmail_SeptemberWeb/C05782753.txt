Subject: Iraq army delays pullout from cities over security (AP)

  BAGHDAD - (AP) An Iraqi military spokesman says the military is delaying a pullout of its forces from
the nation's cities that had been scheduled for the end of this year because of security concerns.
   The spokesman for the Baghdad military operations command, Qassim al-Moussawi, said Saturday that the
military is worried that the police will not be able to handle security in all areas of the country.
   The Iraqi army provides almost all the security in the country and can be seen at checkpoints and driving
around in Humvees throughout most of Iraq's major cities.
   The plan was to hand over security to the police by the end of this year, but Iraqi defense officials worry that
the police are not yet up to the job.
