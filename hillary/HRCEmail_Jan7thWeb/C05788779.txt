Re: Hezbollah & Cuba


During the week of September 5, 2011 extremely sensitive sources reported in confidence that the Israeli Intelligence and
Security Service (Mossad) has informed the leadership of the Israeli Government that Hezbollah is establishing an
operational base in Cuba, designed to support terrorist attacks throughout Latin America. While this operation is aimed
particularly at Israeli diplomatic and business interests, these sources believe that Hezbollah supporters have been
instructed to also begin casing facilities associated with the United States and the United Kingdom, including diplomatic
missions, major banks, and businesses in the region. These individuals believe that the Hezbollah military commanders
in Lebanon and Syria view these U.S. and U.K. entities as contingency targets to be attacked in the event of U.S. and
British military intervention in either Syria or Iran, at some point in the future.

(Source Comment: One particularly sensitive source noted that during the 1980s reliable information indicated that
Hezbollah carried out similar contingency casing operations against U.S., British, and Israeli facilities and businesses in
Latin America, Europe and North Africa. This source also notes that there is at least one precedent for operational use of
these contingency plans: On March 17, 1992 the terrorist group Islamic Jihad destroyed the Israeli Embassy in Buenos
Aires, Argentina with a bomb hidden in a small truck; acting on behalf of Hezbollah in retaliation for the death of Hezbollah
General Secretary Abbas al-Musawi in February 1992 at the hands of Israeli forces. In the opinion of this sensitive source
Hezbollah operatives cased the Israeli Embassy at an earlier date as part of a contingency plan of attack that was
activated following Musawi's death.)

The Hezbollah office in Cuba is being established under direct orders from the current General Secretary Hasan
Nasrallah, who replaced Musawi in 1992. According to the information available to this source, in preparation for
establishment of the base, Nasrallah, working from inside of Lebanon, carried out secret negotiations with representatives
of the Cuban Government, particularly the Cuban Intelligence Service (General Intelligence Directorate â€” DGI), agreeing

to maintain a very low profile inside of Cuba. Nasrallah also promised to take measures to avoid any trail of evidence that
could lead back to Cuba in the event of a Hezbollah attack in Latin America.

(Source Comment: According to this knowledgeable individual, it is not clear that the DGI assisted with either the
establishment or development of cover for the Office.)

In the opinion of these individuals, Nasrallah hopes to link future terrorist attacks in Latin America to the February 12,
2008 assassination of Hezbollah senior military operative 'mad Mugniyeh in Syria. While many knowledgeable individuals
in the Middle East believe that Mugniyeh was killed by his rivals inside of Hezbollah, Nasrallah wishes to link the death to
Israel. According to this sensitive source, Nasrallah believes that an attack in Latin America would be an excellent
symbolic gesture for such a statement, since Mugniyeh is credited with organizing the 1992 Buenos Aires attack on the
Israeli Embassy. (Note: As mentioned above.) This same source indicated that the Hezbollah military planners believe
their operational and support cells in Paraguay, Brazil and Venezuela are best prepared to carry out active operations at
this time, if they can receive effective support from the base in Cuba.


(Source Comment: In the opinion of a particularly sensitive source, these Hezbollah cells in Latin America are relatively
small, and maintain low profiles in their home countries. According to this individual, these cells draw their base of
support from the Lebanese communities in these countries.)
