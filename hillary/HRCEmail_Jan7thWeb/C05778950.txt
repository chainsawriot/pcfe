Jake S,



We had a AID/State assessment team in Tunisia, and it came up with a good general approach (i.e., the U.S. supports
civil society, NGOs, the media, etc., whereas the Europeans will support government functions in support of free and fair
elections)                 Tunisia does not have an AID mission or ESF account, so we can't simply reprogram funds from
existing Tunisia pipelines. Helping Tunisia has to come from elsewhere.
