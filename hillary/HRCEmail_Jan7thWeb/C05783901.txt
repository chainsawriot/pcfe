Dear Colleagues,

S/E Chris Stevens provided the following update from Benghazi at 1200 EDT to Embassy Tripoli DCM
Polaschik and NEA/MAG Director Roebuck:

        Traffic accident: Following discussions with S/E Stevens and other USG officials, the TNC has
        agreed not to issue any public statement regarding the accident. S/E Stevens' USG
        colleagues are waiting for guidance from their HQ regarding proposed compensation of
        52,000 Libyan dinars ($43,312): 13,000 ($10,828) per victim, to cover funeral costs and other
        compensation. TNC will accompany S/E Stevens on his courtesy calls on the families, to take
        place either today or tomorrow. In the view of S/E Stevens, the TNC has been handling this
        incident in a professional and low-profile manner.

           [Note: S/E Stevens separately provided the following details of the accident: The U.S. vehicle
           was traveling back from the Benghazi airport at moderate speed. The U.S. vehicle was struck
           by the Libyan vehicle going at high speed in an intersection. As a correction to earlier
           information - four people were killed and only two were injured.]

           Police chief: S/E Stevens met with the Benghazi chief of police today, following discussions
           related to the accident. The police chief is a university professor who took on these police
           duties after the revolution. According to the police chief, there are only 3,000 police in the
           Benghazi area, down from 6,000 prior to the revolution. Many police simply did not return to
           their jobs after the revolution, as they feared retaliation. EU and UK reps have met with the

           police chief to discuss possible assistance; the UK is offering body armor and radios, and is
           chairing a local donor coordination working group on security issues.

          TNC governing capacity: Following up on concerns raised by the UK Envoy regarding the
          TNC's governing capacities, S/E Stevens said that there are indeed gaps in the TNC's structure
          and services, as well as some concerns regarding PM-equivalent Mahmoud Jibril's prolonged
          absences from Benghazi. However, the INC is taking steps to address these concerns. The
          Council is holding meetings this week to appoint Ministers-equivalent for Interior and Justice,
          and will hold its first cabinet meetings this weekend (April 30-May 1) after Jibril returns from
          abroad. While S/E Stevens shares the UK's concerns regarding the INC's governing
          capacities, he does not think there is a need yet to address this directly with the TNC. S/E
          Stevens recommends that we wait to see how the TNC addresses these issues over the next
          week.

Subject: Special Envoy Stevens report from Benghazi 4/26 0700 (SBU)

Special Envoy Stevens reported at 0700 EDT on 4/26:

     • Traffic accident: Police have accepted the USG version of the story: that it was an accident and the
       victims were not wearing seatbelts. The USG employees were returning from the airport when the
       incident occurred. A total of four people died and six injured. USG employee injuries are light if any.
       Our people are standing by pending official USG instructions. Stevens notes there is a UK flight
       tomorrow they could be on if necessary. The TNC wants to do a press release to quell the rumor mill.
       Stevens will send the draft back to Department for L and PA clearance.
     • The British envoy departs tomorrow on permanent change of station. There will be a gap before his
       replacement, John Jenkins, arrives from Baghdad.
     • TNC head Mahmoud Tibril will be going to Jordan and will not be back in Benghazi until Friday. The
       development is likely to be met with additional criticism that he is spending too much time abroad at
       the expense of other government affairs.
