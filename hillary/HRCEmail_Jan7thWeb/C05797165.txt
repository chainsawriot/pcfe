Re: French intel in touch with Belmokhtar, etc

Bouteflika that the hostage crisis at In Amenas was concluded and as many as 35 of the hostages had been
killed in fighting with terrorist at the gas facility. Speaking on condition of absolute secrecy a source with
access to the highest levels of the Algerian Army stated that the Special Forces commanders consider the
operation a success, having killed or capture all but a few of the Mokhtar Belmokhtar "Signed in Blood"
fighters. This source stated that a small number of the surviving fighters escaped across the border into
Southern Libya. Senior advisors to President Bouteflika added that they believe Belmokhtar plans to use this
attack to reinvigorate his troops, and may launch additional raids in Mali and Libya, as well as other parts of
Algeria in the near future.

meet in secret with Belmokhtar or one of his lieutenants in northern Mauritania in the immediate future. They
have been ordered to establish the reason why Belmokhtar violated their two year old secret agreement, and
launched attacks inside of Algeria. They believe that this attack is a part of growing effort by AQIM in
Northwest Africa (supported by kidnapping), and fear that it may be the first blow in a new phase of the
Algerian civil war. These sources noted that Belmokhtar can call on the support of 5,000-10,000 battle

hardened fighters across the region. They add that he views Westerners with disdain, and sees Bouteflika as a
puppet of these foreign interests.
