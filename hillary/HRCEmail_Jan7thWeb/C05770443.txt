It is now all over the Mexican press that the wife of Chapo Guzman was arrested yesterday and then released because
the government did not have the capacity to link her to a crime. I will refrain from comment in this channel on the validity
of latter point. I would guess that it is at best a matter of days or less before it becomes clear who ordered her release.

I sent you a message on the high side. I have asked the Operations Center to pass it to the Secretary. The matter may
be in the PDB tomorrow. James Morris in Ops has it if you want to call in to him.
