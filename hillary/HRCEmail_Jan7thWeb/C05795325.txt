Thank you Cheryl,

We are very committed to developing and expanding training in this critical cross-cutting area. While we do include
gender issues in many of our courses from training for Afghanistan and Iraq to Democracy and Human Rights and our
new Diplomacy and Development offerings, we have not yet developed any stand alone training. We have met a
number of times with S/GWI staff and Melanne and Anita often present in courses in our Leadership School. What we
need now, to move forward on stand-alone offerings (classroom and distance learning) is real course content,
specifically case studies and best practices from embassies on a variety of gender issues. Most of all, we need a subject
matter expert with the necessary grounding in both theory and practice who has the time to devote to working with us
to develop the courses.

For example, we have been able to develop distance learning and classroom training for our QDDR deliverables on
Diplomacy and Development because, after a number of fits and starts, we were able to convince AID to detail a senior
AID officer, Janet Ballentyne to work nearly full-time on these issues. With Janet's expertise in development and our
expertise in course design, we have been able to roll out a great DL course, will offer our first classroom course later this
month and Janet speaks regularly to classes all across FSI on development issues.

If we could identify someone with the expertise who could commit the time to work with us we could launch the effort
with an interagency policy roundtable at FSI, which could include academics and civil society representatives. That
approach has been useful in getting content and speakers for other courses, for example the Religion and Foreign Policy
course that we launched last year.

We will also be meeting soon with Carla Capell at USAID, who we are told has developed or contracted for training
modules for USAID - bottom line is we really care about this and if S/GWI can identify a partner for us, who has the time
and background, we're eager to do more. Cheers, Ruth

Subject: Policy Directive on Gender Equality

Dear Ruth

Jake and I connected today to discuss the Policy Directive on Gender. One of our key concerns is how we best to embed
in FSI the type of learning and training recommended in the directive, and in particular, what will be the source for that
curriculum. I also welcome understanding what the nature of the teachings that would be offered â€” classes? case
studies? other approaches? principles?

I am sure you are in touch with S/GWI in this regard and I was wondering if you might share what ordinarily is the
information and data you have to develop curricula, your typical sources for the material, as well as your thoughts for
what would be serve your needs in developing this curriculum given its newness and uniqueness?

I also am inclined to seek some outside support for this effort and want to make sure this would prove helpful to you.

Best.
