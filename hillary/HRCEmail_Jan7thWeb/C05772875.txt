Jake,

Dale is in for a Department Heroism award. The nomination is with the Secretary's award committee, which is chaired
by the DG. Assuming Dale receives the award, we would recommend S present the award and consider the following
press options: (1) Open press (the event would be listed on public schedule and PA would facilitate press attendance at
actual ceremony), (2) Camera spray, (3) official photo only (State Dept photographer takes photo that we can release to
press with caption/press release), and (4) a press release (no press presence at ceremony at all, but we release info
about the ceremony and award to press). Press option is your call.



From: Sullivan, Jacob J

What is the status of this?

Jake,

I just received an award recommendation from the military for a US civilian (Dale Kramer) in the field for heroic
action. The civilian was embedded with a special forces team when it came under Taliban fire (IED and machine gun) in
Paktya. At that point, Dale grabbed a machine gun and proceeded for twenty minutes to provide suppressing fire so
that the entire team could withdraw from the scene of the attack. We will look into the specific and seek a away for the
civilian to be recognized by S, but this is also an important anecdote for the public relations effort you mentioned
yesterday and that we will discuss later today.
