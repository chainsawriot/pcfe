Report on Alan Gross trial yesterday:


The Cuban Supreme Court's Division for Crimes Against the State held oral arguments in the Alan Gross case on July 22,
2011. USINT was allowed to attend, and the Acting CG was able to speak briefly with Gross who,
                                                                      The public at large was not permitted to attend. A
heavy security presence surrounded the Supreme Court building, with the press also unable to enter the
grounds. Arguments proffered by Gross's defense counsel dominated the hearing which only lasted 45 minutes. Gross
gave a brief speech, allegedly unprecedented in Cuban jurisprudence, thanking the court and "hoping for a positive
outcome for all." The presiding justice announced at the end of the proceedings that the court would deliver its decision
"in a few days". USINT and CCA note that Cuba has holidays scheduled Monday-Wednesday of next week, so if the court
does not come out with a ruling over the weekend, a decision may not be announced until after July 27th.
