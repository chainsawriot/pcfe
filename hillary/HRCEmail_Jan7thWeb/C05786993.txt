FYI â€” leaving SA shortly, refueling in Senegal, traveling then straight to Haiti is best information.

Mr. Ambassador,
It appears that Aristide will be departing on a Bombardier Global aircraft with tail number ZS-BBZ at approximately
2400. The flight plan we believe has the aircraft routing through Dakar, Senegal for fuel. The Bombardier has a range of
approximately 5000 miles, so it could conceivably make the flight from Dakar to Port au Prince without another fuel
stop.
We are fairly confident of the Dakar routing, but not 100 percent sure.




                                                                                                                             B6
