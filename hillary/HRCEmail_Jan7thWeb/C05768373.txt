Thanks, I will relay this to the WH.

I was sure to inform them last week that you spoke to Berry, and I understand Rahm was in touch with Berry as well.
They're still nervous about him and were hopeful for a second call. But if President Clinton has already spoken to him,
perhaps that's unnecessary.

As for Congresswoman Sanchez, I can reach out to her Chief of Staff and at the very least let her know that you've been
trying to reach the Congresswoman.

I will be sure to let the WH know about Kanjorski.

Thanks again.

Miguel--

 I don't think the WH knows I spoke w Berry last week

                                   Pelosi's guarantee that the DCCC would support his Chief of Staff who is running to
succeed him was very helpful.

 Neither Bill nor I can get Loretta on the phone but we will keep trying.

 Bill spoke w Tanner and his team should have reported back
                                                                Only the DCCC can reassure him on this.

A couple of updates.

(1) Further to Huma's email,



(2) The House convenes tomorrow at 1 pm. There will be an hour of debate on rule, then a vote on the rule between 2
pm and 3 pm. There will then be two hours of debate, followed by a vote on the bill and a vote on reconciliation at
approximately 5 pm.

(3) With respect to the abortion issue,
                                                                                      but Congressman Stupak has
indicated that the EO will not suffice for his purposes. However, I'm also told "five or six members" of Stupak's coalition
are satisfied by the EO.
