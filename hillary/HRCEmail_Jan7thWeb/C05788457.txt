That is ridiculously low. A lot of the Libyan campaign assets were in the region too. There's an interview today in the.
Times w a pilot who flew out of his base at Aviano. No doubt Libya is more expensive but moving ships, overflights and
providing direct assistance has to cost more than 40M.

Subject: Japan costs

Not sure I totally trust this, but the task force has queried relevant USG agencies and came up with a running cost of $40
million (not for public use). This is a rough estimate with a large standard error.

Why so small? Many of our assets were already in place when the earthquake hit, so the incremental cost of providing
the support was low. Agency sharing agreements also mitigated costs. DOD bore about 62.5 percent of total.
