Subject: Unbelievable

The Jerusalem Post reported today that a NY Hasidic paper Der Zeitung published the sit room photo w/o me (or Audrey
T) photoshopped out perhaps because no woman should be in such a place of power or that I am dressed immodestly!!
This is reported at:

And so, Happy Mother's Day
