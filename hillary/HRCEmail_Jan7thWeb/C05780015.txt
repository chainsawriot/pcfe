Re: Q location, new defections, beginnings of interim govt


This report is in part a response to your questions. There will be further information coming in the next day.


(Source Comment: In a private conversation during the evening of February 26, Libyan
Minister of Foreign Affairs Mousa Kousa stated that Muammar Qaddafi is moving his
living quarters on a daily basis, primarily between secure Air Force and External Security
Organization (ESO) facilities in the Tripoli region. Qaddafi is convinced that he is under
threat of attack from Western military forces (particularly NATO), as well as disloyal

members of his regime. Accordingly, he is seeking council from a shrinking circle of
advisors, including Mousa Kousa, his sons Montasem, and Saif al-Islam, as well as loyal
officers from the Air Force, Presidential Guard, and the ESO. Qaddfi believes that, in the
event of a collapse of security situation in Tripoli, he can always retreat to the town of
Sirte, which is controlled by his Qadhafah tribe.)
During the morning of February 26 a former official of the Libyan Government stated in
confidence that Muammar Qaddafi was visibly shaken when informed by security officials that
the large Magariha tribe, based around the southern city of Sabah, could no longer be counted
on to support him. Many of the leaders of the Armed forces and the Intelligence services come
from the Magariha, and Qaddafi has favored this tribe since coming to power in
1969. According to these individuals, Qaddafi began receiving reports on 19 February that the
Magariha were turning against the government, but he believed that they would support him
when faced with a full scale uprising in the eastern part of the country. (Source Comment: The
leaders of the Magariha were angered when Qaddafi allowed tribal member Abdelbaset Ali al-
Megrahi to take the blame for the Lockerbie bombing in an international tribunal in 2001. The
Libyan leader believed that he had resolved this situation when al-Megrahi was released from
prison in Scotland and returned to a hero's welcome in Libya in 2009.)
Qaddafi was particularly angry when Minister of Foreign Affairs Mousa Kousa also warned
that Abdessalem Jalloud, his lifelong friend, former Prime Minister, and senior member of the
Magariha, is believed to be giving encouragement to the anti-government forces in the western
part of the country, and in parts of Tripoli. Jalloud is in ill health and has kept a low profile in
recent years, but he is one of the original young officers who supported Qaddafi in the 1969
coup d'etat against King Idriss al-Sanusi.
(Source Comet: Jalloud and Qaddafi are childhood friends and attended the Royal Military
Academy together in the mid-1960s. Following the coup, Jalloud was Qaddafi's most powerful
advisor from 1969 to 1993. While the two have not been close since Qaddafi relieved Jalloud
as Prime Minister in 1993, the idea that one of his few lifelong friends has turned against him
seems to his advisors to have shaken Qaddafi. He did not indicate what action he planned to
take against Jalloud, if he can get to him.)

While the Magariha situation was difficult for Qaddafi to hear, Mousa Kousa and his other
security advisors were more concerned when three tribes important to the protection of the oil
fields in the Wahat region south of Benghazi went over to the opposition on February 25: the al-
Zuwayya from Jikharra oasis, El-Mjabra from Jalu's oasis and al-Awajila from Awjila
oasis. These tribes have now announced that they will protect the oil fields if forces loyal to
Qaddafi attack the facilities there, in an effort to carry out his threat to cut off oil to the West, if
his regime begins to falter.
As the revolution in Libya spreads into Tripoli, tribal leaders, former members of the regime,
students and academics, have begun organizing into new political structures in the areas held by
opposition forces. Former Minister of Justice Mustafa Abdel Galil, and tribal leaders from the
eastern part of the country met in the town of Al Bayda to begin the process of forming an
interim government. At the same time, individuals with access to these new political leaders
state that some of the student and academic leaders are skeptical of the motives of Galil and
other former members of Qaddafi's government. One Libyan academic told a member of the
Moslem Brotherhood in Egypt that Galil and others are trying to avoid responsibility for past
crimes, while taking advantage of the chaos in the country to gain power.
This individual added that opposition forces in Benghazi have been carefully watching the
activities of former Minister of Interior, General Abdul Fatah Younis al Abidi, and have placed
him under guard. At present he is not being allowed to have outside contact. Opposition
leaders know that Younis can be valuable in the struggle against Qaddafi, but they also feel that
after 40 years as a senior Army officer and Minister of Interior, he may have to answer for the
activities of the old regime. (Source Comment: Younis is under house arrest in Benghazi, and
no decision has been made by the various opposition leaders on whether or not to enlist him in
support of the leadership of the opposition, as a new government starts to take shape.)
