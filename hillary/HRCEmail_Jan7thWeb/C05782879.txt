Subject: Quick readout from Jeff Feltman in Tripol

Jeff asked me to pass along the following readout. Please excuse the free-form list of subjects but I wanted to get this
out quickly to as wide an audience as possible. Please feel free to share with others I've missed.

    1. State of Embassy Tripoli facility: While admitting he is no engineer, Jeff agrees with the initial OBO assessment
         that the facility is not salvageable —the condition is "shocking and photos doesn't do it justice." Floors have
         collapsed, the ballistic glass and metal support beams have melted, and it has been totally trashed. Jeff asked
         for their help on Embassy security; they took this on board but noted that they are still in the process of trying to
         secure the country.
    2.   Abdel Jalil and Mahmoud Jibril both to NY next week: Both will travel to NY next week for the high level
         meeting on the 20th. Jalil will then return to Libya, and Jibril will remain in NY to deliver the Libyan address to
         UNGA on the 24th. The plan is to have the new cabinet in place by the 24th, with Jibril the likely PM. Jeff pressed
         them on including a woman on their UN delegation. He also made all of the points about the need for the TNC
         to take the lead in NY in outlining what they are seeking from the int'l community but they didn't share their
         ideas about what they will say.
         Action needed: Jalil needs a visa,                                                                          I       B3 INA
         understand MAG is working this now but we will need to facilitate issuance (likely by Embassy Tunis).
    3.   Saadi Qadhafi and Niger: Jibril has sent a letter to Niamey and is sending the Deputy FM there to talk about
         Saadi. The Libyan request to Niger will be two-fold: 1. Detain him properly (they understand he is free to roam
          about; 2. Be prepared to return him to Libya to stand trial.
    4.    Weapons issues: They will ask OPCW to come back and they want them to say yes but the Libyans are picking
          up noises from OPCW that they can't accept a request from the TNC now because the TNC is not a UN
          member. (comment: I know the credentials issue is being worked this week in NY but Ken Ward please convey
          to OPCW that they need to take the Libyans up on their request asap.)
    5.    OUP mandate: they think NATO should stay beyond an additional 30 days (I told Jeff I thought we were now
          looking at 90 in any case).
    6.    Pan Am 103: Jeff raised the issue with Jalil and the Justice Minister, which they took on board; Justice Minister
          said "this was a crime against humanity so Libya has to cooperate."
    7.    Treatment of Libyans of color and African migrants: Jeff raised and they responded with the right things.
    8.    Oil fund paper: Passed to TNC.
    9.    "Boots on the ground": they asked about the comments they had seen and expressed their concern over
          them. Jeff explained that these were people to help provide security for our people and facility and why they
          were necessary.                                                                                                         B5

      10. Situation on the ground: definitely returning to normal, with stores open and traffic gridlocked, and electricity
          and water flowing. Lots of appreciation for the US role. Tarhouni was optimistic about the future; Jalil more
          cautious.

Jeff can add more when he is in a place with blackberry/computer access.
