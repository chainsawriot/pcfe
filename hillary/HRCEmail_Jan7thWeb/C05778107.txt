Subject: Start treaty

Dear Mme. Secretary,




    Valerie and I have been alarmed over reports this week that the new START treaty might not be ratified during this
lame duck Congress. As you know, Valerie helped to narrate and appeared in a documentary that came out this summer
called "Countdown to Zero" which makes a very convincing case to move toward the complete elimination of the
world's nuclear arsenals. A ratified START treaty is a necessary and critical first step toward that goal. Valerie continues
to advocate and educate on this issue by working with the folks at Global Zero. It is something she cares about
passionately and is, in fact, a more public extension of the covert work she was doing while serving in the CIA.




Valerie asked me to convey to you and Ambassador Tauscher her desire to be of any help possible in getting START
through Congress. We know how hard you have worked to make the new START treaty a ratified reality and would love
to be as supportive as we can be of your efforts. Among other things, Valerie will be at Harvard with Graham Allison on
December 1, specifically to participate in a showing of Countdown to Zero and a subsequent panel discussion on the
whole question of nuclear arms reduction. Perhaps the event can be part of a broader effort to bring light to the subject
and heat to the backside of Senator Kyl.




Please don't hesitate to call on us if and when you think it useful. With warmest regards and best wishes this
Thanksgiving season.
