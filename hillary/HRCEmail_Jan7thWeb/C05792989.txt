   1. Attached is a high level summary (one pager) that deals with core (non-OCO) budget issues.

   2.   I think the frontline states (Iraq, Afgh, Pak core and OCO budget) material in the book is fine and speaks for
        itself.

   3. Rob's note on USAID is below.

   4.   I also gave hardcopies of #1 + #3 to Joanne to put in your bag to take to dinner.

Cheryl -- We completed the presentation on the FY 2014 budget and you should have it when you arrive back in
town. We are now scheduled to see the Secretary on Tuesday to go over the summary slides. A few points I want to
raise to your attention with respect to USAID.
