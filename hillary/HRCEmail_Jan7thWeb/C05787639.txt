Subject: RE: S "Quad" call tomorrow

There was no decision at NATO today                                          and no NAC                         B5
scheduled tomorrow â€” which is why we are asking her to push this along. Here is email I just sent to
policy team proposing the desired outcome of the call.


                                                                                                           B5
