Re: Who killed Younis


SOURCE: Sources with access to the Libyan Transitional National Council as well as Western Intelligence and security
services.


During the morning of August 5, 2011 sources with direct access to senior levels of the Libyan Transnational Council
(TNC) stated in strictest confidence that the rebel military commander, General Abdel Fatah Younis was executed by
security forces on orders from TNC Chairman Mustapha Jalil. According to these sources,'in late July 2011 TNC security
officers received what they believed to be reliable information that Younis was involved in a secret dialogue with Saif al-
Islam Qaddafi, the son of Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi. These discussions involved planning for Younis and Saif al-
Islam to establish a government of reconciliation, with Muammar Qaddafi living in internal exile, and the TNC being
disbanded in favor of officials, and military officers loyal to Saif and Younis. Jalil ordered Younis' arrest, and once he was
in TNC custody instructed security officers to shoot the army commander.

According to these knowledgeable individuals, Jalil and his supporters began disseminating the story that Younis was
killed by either pro-Qaddafi forces, or Islamic radicals within the INC military. There is no indication that rebel Prime
Minister Mahmoud Jabril, his senior aid Abdul Hafiz Ghoza, overall military commander General Abdelessalem Jalloud, or
Younis replacement as field commander General Khalifa Haftar were involved in the decision to execute Younis.

Younis, was a former senior military officer and Minister of Interior in the Qaddafi regime, who joined the rebels in
February 2011, after serving his friend Muammar Qaddafi for over 40 years. When Younis first joined the rebel forces
TNC security officers placed him under surveillance, believing that he might have been sent by Qaddafi to infiltrate their
ranks. After a variety of loyalty tests he was welcomed into the rebel leadership, however, it now appears that the security
officers maintained their coverage of Younis and at some point in early July established his contact with Saif al-Islam
Qaddafi.

(Source Comment: Knowledgeable sources state that Jalil and his security forces felt that Younis' actions posed an
immediate threat to the TNC and the ongoing revolution. Jalil made the decision to order Younis' arrest and execution
rather than submit the matter for debate in the 31 member TNC. To date these sources add that there is no indication
that none of the TNC members have challenged Jalil's decision.)

Jalil remains committed to defeating the Qaddafi regime and is unwilling to negotiate with Saif al-Islam, or another
representative of Muammar Qaddafi. According to these sources, Jalil believes reports that the Saif — Younis negotiations
had at least the tacit support of the governments of the United States, Germany, France, and Russia.

(Source comment: A separate sensitive source noted that Jalil remains highly suspicious of the activities of the four
governments, and has privately expressed hostility toward their representatives in TNC capital of Benghazi. That said he
is well aware of the fact that he will need the support of the major powers, particularly the United States, to guarantee the
future of the TNC government.)
