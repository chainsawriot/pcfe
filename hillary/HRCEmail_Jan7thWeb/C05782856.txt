Iran to release U.S. hikers after they pay $500,000 bail each, attorney says

Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer, two American hikers accused of being spies in Iran, will be released from an
Iranian prison after a $500,000 bail is paid for each of them, the two men's attorney said Tuesday.

The lawyer said he has spoken to the two men's family and they are trying to get the money quickly.

If the two men walk free this would be the end of an international tug-of-war between Iran and the United States
that has stretched on for over two years.

More than two years ago, the two men along with Sarah Shourd - Bauer's fiancee - were hiking in Iraq's
autonomous Kurdish region along the Iranian border.

Iranian police arrested the three Americans, saying they illegally entered Iran. They were also charged with
spying.
