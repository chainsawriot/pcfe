I'm now totally invested in VOA or a 21st century alternative. Will start working on how you can frame this publicly.

FYI, this would be an interesting new position for Wadah.



 Muslim Brotherhood planning media venture with Qatari

 The Muslim Brotherhood is planning to establish a major media organization and
 research center with Qatari partnership, sources from the group said on Thursday.

 According to the sources, the MB's Guidance Bureau decided at its last meeting to
 mandate supreme guide Khairat al-Shater to travel to Doha in the coming days to
 sign a contract for the project with investors there, along with a delegation including
 Guidance Bureau members Mahmoud Ghozlan and Hossam Abou Bakr.

 The foundation would include a global satellite news channel and an independent
 daily newspaper, sources claimed.

 Sources at Shater's office told Al-Masry AI-Youm that the Brotherhood asked him to
 finalize the work on the channel and the newspaper because the MB's media
 organization has not been able to compete with other media institutions. MB youth
 recently sent a memorandum outlining this problem to Shater.

 During a recent visit to Doha, Shater allegedly negotiated an agreement with
 unnamed Qatari investors to buy shares in the channel, on condition that
 management remains in the hands of Shater and that he directly supervise the new
 institution, sources said.

 According to the sources, the initial capital agreed upon for establishing the media
 foundation would be US$100 million.

 Palestinian media personality Wadah Khanfar was reported to have been
 chosen by Shater as the channel's chariman, and Ahmed Mansour as its
 executive director.

Qotb al-Araby, a member of the media committee of the Brotherhood's Freedom
and Justice party, said that the group is in urgent need of strong media institutions
in the upcoming period in order to work against media attacks on President
Mohamed Morsy's success and the Brotherhood at large.

Araby said that the real crisis currently facing the MB is the lack of Islamist investors
who would be willing to put their money into media, a sector that is costly and prone
to significant monetary losses.
