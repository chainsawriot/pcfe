Dear Arturo--

 Thanks for coming w me to Haiti yesterday and thank you for going to Santo Domingo tomorrow.

  Please tell President Fernandez that I raised his request to add his soldiers to MINUSTAH and was advised by the
commander that they would have to be self-sufficient. And that the UN and our military are looking at the greater use of
a private airport in the DR. Also discuss w him the costs for what the DR is doing to help Haiti and what they would
expect in terms of financial reimbursement from the international community.

  Also thank you for your year end report; I know Mike Fuchs has been following up w you and your team. Because of
my busy travel schedule this month, I may not have time to meet w you about it so I wanted to add some additional
issues and questions:

1) Sen. Baucus contacted me about his support for a US-Canada park in the Flathead, Mont area. It is primarily an
Interior Dept. responsibility but State has a role because of the inter-national nature of it. Pls be sure someone in WHA
stays on top of this.

2) Similarly, Cong. John Dingell called about another international park w Canada, the Detroit River International Wildlife
Refuge that he wants to see us pursue. Pls have someone look into this and let me know what's the status of the project.

3) President Funes is under attack w/in his own party because he is perceived as too pro-American.



4) Should we be doing more on the case of Alan
