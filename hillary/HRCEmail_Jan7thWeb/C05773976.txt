Pascual delivered a great speech on US-Mexican relations at Stanford yesterday; Rich will circulate to key Hill
members/staff.

Afghanistan Jack and Eikenberry recommend separate calls to Karzai on PSC issue on Monday, after
deMistura raises with him today, Afghan NSC meets tomorrow, and Eikenberry sees him on Sunday.

Press Likely strong attention to NYT story on US human rights vetting of Pakistani units and WP report of

wires tonight; State's likely only vulnerability will be on reports of Congressional visits.
