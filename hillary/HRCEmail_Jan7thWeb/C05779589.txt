Re: Libya & Big Idea

   1. No-fly! Brava! You did it! I am deeply proud and grateful.More intel to come...
       Big idea: See the article below on a projected Union of the Mediterranean by Mustapha Tlili, research
       scholar at New York University, founder and director of the NYU Center for Dialogues, and a member
       of Human Rights Watch's advisory committee for the Middle East and North Africa.
       Sarkozy hit upon this as an earlier ploy and has not taken it up again because he's playing demagogic
       games about "multiculturalism." But this is a strategic idea to reorient thinking about integration of the
       Muslim world and the West, with the US playing a critical role—the Union of the Mediterranean. Such
       a Union is only possible after the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions. It can begin with initial economic
       links much like the EU began with a coal and steel accord and then unfold into many other areas. After.
       your trip to Tunisia and Egypt—and the opportunity that Libya will present—the US can take a
       leadership role. You might consider formulating some first steps and articulating the concept. This gives
       the US a new role in Europe; recasts the war on terrorism; isolates those Arab states that remain
       authoritarian repressive regimes without imposing punitive measures; gives the US a hand in reform and
       development in Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, Libya, etc.; and offers a new incentive into the Mideast peace
       process (such as it is).
