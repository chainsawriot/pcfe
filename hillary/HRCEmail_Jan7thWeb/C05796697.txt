Heard you kicked butt tonight, from a lot of different sources. I didn't escape the office til it was too late to get there.

                Jake:
                I just had a pretty detailed briefing on the Disabilities Convention vote,
                which will now happen Tuesday. They are very close-63+ yes.




                Let me know if you want to discuss

                Best
                Harold
