Security     One bomb exploded in parking lot next to Embassy in Tbilisi; another unexploded — no casualties
or Embassy damage; unclear if Embassy was target. There had been no previous threat information. Georgian
authorities fully cooperating. Embassy Paris issued warden message to Americans in Paris warning of
increased terrorist threat, though nothing targeting U.S. interests specifically. Violence in Karachi continues in
wake of MQM leader assassination in London


Congress       SFRC unanimously reported out UK/Australia Defense Trade Treaties; ratification will depend on
passage of implementing legislation, which Berman is holding pending a deal on relaxed export controls on
defense trade with Israel. NDAA failed; Senate now considering campaign finance reform. Clapper will brief
Senate on recent intel; Rose and DoD will participate to provide context. L is still looking at documents Sen.
Feinstein requested on CIA detentions. HASC testimony with Gates 9/30 now may not happen. Rich is
exploring topics for possible breakfast next week — PSD on development may be a good one. We've now
formally implemented requirement that all reports to the Congress, other than specifically granted exceptions,
must be five pages or less.


Iraq Allawi appears to be softening demand to be PM; Jim J will see him today.
