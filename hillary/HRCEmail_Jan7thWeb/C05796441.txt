Cheryl:



Are we in a good place to begin paperwork to bring Jen Davis up here on TDY in October?



If so, I would recommend we ask her to report on October 29 and I will get the EX office to start the

paperwork. She will be detailed to us for 90 days, which will enable her to receive funding for housing, meals +

incidentals, etc., and this 90 day period will carry her through the end of the term on January 20, 2013. This

schedule would give me 10 days or so of consultation before a desired departure for Vienna on November 14.



I am not intent on rushing out to Vienna; the closer we get the more there is to be done, and we may not get

ourselves "packed out" before we depart (not a wholly unwelcomed outcome, since we can set aside that task for

December or January). But, if the elements are in place, Carol and I would like to go out mid-November in order

to participate in IAEA meetings on November 26-30.



My swearing-in ceremony is scheduled for November 9 at 10am on the 8th floor. Whatever plan we embrace, that

date is set and Carol and I are eager for the day.
