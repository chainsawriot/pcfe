Re: Intel on Gaddafi's reinforcements


From another intelligence source, this one a senior counselor to Gaddafi since his taking power but now living
in exile in Amman:

Gaddafi is calling in fighter planes and bombers from the governments of Mali and Chad, aircraft he had
subsidized with his oil wealth. These other countries are cooperating with Gaddafiâ€”they are on his payroll.
