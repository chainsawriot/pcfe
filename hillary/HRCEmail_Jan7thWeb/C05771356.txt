When you say don't forget Mitchell and team - you mean for first call or second?
My roster for second call was:

                                                                                                                    B5

I can do anytime in morning starting at 7 or 8am and before 12 and would prefer earlier but will do whenever it's
convenient. Also, don't forget Mitchell and team.

Fyi, see below.

Also, what is a good time to set con calls?

My thought is                                    and then one with the whole crew. Perhaps late morning?            B5
