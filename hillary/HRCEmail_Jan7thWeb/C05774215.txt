I spoke with Bill a short while ago. He had come from the all-members briefing on the hill



Bill recommends that you
                                             A draft call sheet, with a face-saving way out at the end is attached (I've
copied Monica on this).

Bill thinks you should try to place the call sometime in the Morning, perhaps just before the prebrief or in one of the car
rides.

Look forward to discussing.

Also talked to Tom who thinks this will land at him and Miller this weekend.

And got the document from Wendy for you to review in the morning.

FINALLY, Bill says you should definitely read the PDB tomorrow.
