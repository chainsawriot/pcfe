See chain below. Dana's reports are breathless because she monitors AJ and other regional outlets, but interesting.

Lots more from Baradei, not a lot new:
- I expect today to continue w peaceful demos, this march to freedom will not stop until Mubarak leaves
- Egyptians may be poor but they are smart. They want a new state built on democracy and respect for human rights
- we will continue protests in the coming days, the country will be paralyzed until Mubarak leaves
- I am not from any party. I reflect the protesters' wishes. I represent Copts and Muslims
- I met with protesters last night and they were all arrested after they left my house
- it's a trick that the MB will take over Egypt, they do not have a majority. There will not be a theocracy like Iran

Amr Moussa is in Tahrir

El Baradei on Al now: it is time for Mubarak to leave now, time that you listen to your people's demands. Leave with
dignity.

Al reports 500,000 protesting in Alex (pop 4 million), also in Ismailia- calling for Mubarak to step down.

No opposition party flags in Tahrir. By all accounts thus far the scenes are of unity and patriotism

The speaker of the state-backed Al Azhar mosque resigned today and joined the protesters in Tahrir.

Nile TV is carrying aerial images, no sound.

The crowds are chanting louder and louder. The square is packed, but people are still streaming to join

Someone with a mic, telling the protesters to be silent. There may be an announcement

Hundreds of thousands shouting "down Mubarak, leave, leave! Mubarak 'baatel'- illegitimate-, NDP is baatel, thugs are
baatel, Habib al Adli is baatel"
singing the nat'l anthem, very emotional crowds

Al Jazeera estimates 2 million in the crowd. Crowds have stocked food and water, "ready for a standoff or a seige"

Muslims and Christians praying simultaneously in Tahrir

Tahrir are the largest prayer gathering in the Muslim world today. Pictures are incredible. "Like Mecca", according to
one. Al Arabiya (which has been moderate in reporting and estimates) estimates 1 million people already

The Tahrir sermon preacher "no opposition parties have the right to speak on behalf of protesters" also "This protest
belongs to Christians, Muslims, women, men"

Qaradawi:

- Mubarak is responsible for what happened. If a leader is hated he must leave, you can't lead by force

-if he was really their father, he would have mercy on the people. The youth were there. Not one policeman was killed,
the protesters didn't shoot. Until the thugs came, rented by the state.

- the PM says, I don't know who did this? The gov't did it.

- just because you want to stay seven months? You will kill your people for seven months? Go now.

- I call on Mubarak to leave. To the Egyptian Army, protect your people. You fought for them. The regime will go but the
state will stay. I'm not calling on the army to rule, but to protect.

- the VP is the President, the same.
Take power from the vp and give it to the people. The army must install and independent temp supreme judge. That is
my wish.

Tens of thousands have gathered in Tahrir. Friday prayers start in a few minutes. After prayers end, more crowds are
expected in Tahrir.

Helicopters are flying low, Egyptian Museum is heavily fortified with tanks.

leave

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's Friday sermon 9.00-10.00 gmt




In his Friday sermon, carried live on Al Alam, Ayatollah Khamenei made the following main points:



•   praised the Tunisia and Egyptian people

    said President Mubarak was not only a tyrant but "an agent and servant of Zionism" who lays siege to Gaza




•   There were reports Tunisian President Ben Ali was a CIA agent.




•   Egypt was a leading Arab and Muslim state with a proud record opposing colonialism and Israel. But US control over
Egypt's ruler had turned it into an "arch enemy of Palestine", while Syria had preserved its independent stance.




•   The "miraculous event" began in Tunis and will culminate in "the great Egypt".




•   If the Egyptian people manage to make advances this will be a huge defeat for the US.

•   what is happening in Cairo is an "explosion or holy wrath at the position on Islam taken by the traitor, agent
regime."




    expected elements of the army to side with the people.




    US support for agent regimes for 30 years meant it had not role to give advice to Egypt now.




•   Western media is spreading lies about Iranian interference in Egypt to spread Shiism




Khamenei spoke in Arabic for much of his speech, especially the passages on Egypt.
