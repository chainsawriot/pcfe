Subject: Israeli envoy returns to Egypt (AP)



CAIRO (AP) - Airport officials say that Israel's ambassador to Egypt has returned to Cairo after he and other
embassy staffers fled on military planes when thousands of angry Egyptians attacked the embassy in September.
  An official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press said
Yitzhak Levanon returned to Cairo Sunday through Istanbul.
  Egyptian rioters ransacked the Israeli Embassy following the killing of six Egyptian soldiers in Sinai as Israel
pursued Palestinian militants who infiltrated Israel from Egypt's Sinai desert.
  Several Israeli security delegations have visited Egypt during the past two months to discuss the return of the
ambassador and to decide on a new embassy location.
