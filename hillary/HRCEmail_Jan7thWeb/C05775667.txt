I agree--and we should use this as a model.

FYI, I think this is a good example of how we should we respond in cases like this. Puts a very human face on these issues
and allows us to demonstrate our commitment to human rights and our support for civil society organizations, plus, as
Mrs. Chebeya stated our public support for her and her family provides a level of security for them. Sam Brock has
done an excellent job handling the case.

        Chargé receives family of slain human rights activist to express sympathy and reaffirm USG commitment to
bringing killers to justice




1. (SBU) Chargé met July 16 with Annie Chebeya, widow of human rights activist Floribert Chebeya, and her six children.
The meeting, proposed by Under Secretary Judith McHale during her June 29 meeting with Ms. Chebeya (ref A), was a
platform for the Embassy to console the family and to again urge the Congolese government to ensure that the inquiry

into Chebeya's death is independent and to provide protection for the family. Chargé began by conveying to family
members how much their husband and father was admired and appreciated in the U.S. because of his dedication to the
cause of human rights in the DRC. Chargé characterized Chebeya's efforts to promote human rights and political
liberties as similar to the efforts of U.S. civil rights leaders, including Martin Luther King. Chargé emphasized that the
U.S. remained committed to pressing the GDRC to conduct a transparent and independent inquiry into Chebeya's death
and to punish those responsible and gave a brief summary of his efforts to date.




2. (SBU) Ms. Chebeya thanked chargé and the Embassy for their efforts. She noted that her children remained afraid to
leave their home, explaining that three of them did not take their final school exams. Even though her husband had
been killed some six weeks before, Ms. Chebeya believed the family would be in danger throughout the course of the
investigation, which was now the responsibility of the military prosecutor. Chargé said he would meet soon with the
chief military prosecutor and would press for a commitment from the authorities that the family would be safe. Mrs.
Chebeya said the military prosecutor had called her and given assurances that she and the family were not in danger.
Chargé asked her if the conversation had been positive and she replied that it had been and that she appreciated the
prosecutor's reassurances (Note: The meeting with the military prosecutor took place later the same day; ref (b) is a
report on the meeting. End note.).




3. (SBU) Ms. Chebeya noted that U.S. public support for the Chebeya family was particularly important to ensure the
family's security, as the GDRC has done little to deal with those arrested in connection with the Chebeya murder, or
even to begin legal proceedings. She was particularly critical of Lambert Mende, Minister of Communications and
government spokesperson, who had dishonored her husband and was highly critical of civil society calls for an
independent investigation during a press conference earlier in the week. Ms. Chebeya stated that Mende, "as he is so
disrespectful of my husband, and he is the spokesperson for president, is most likely conveying the views of the
president." Chargé said the Embassy would continue to press for an independent inquiry, and would try to determine
the nature and context of Mende's comments. Chargé again cited his previous meetings with key GDRC officials and
mentioned his upcoming meeting with the chief military prosecutor to urge an independent investigation and to
reiterate the U.S. offer of technical assistance with the investigation. When chargé asked the children if they had any
questions, ten-year-old Fonderine asked if he would be able to help her family find the person who killed her father.
Chargé said he and the United States would do everything they could to ensure justice for the Chebeya family. Chargé
then presented the family with a number of books obtained from Africa Regional Services (ARS) Paris on the United
States and its civil rights movement, and spoke of Dr. Martin Luther King and the fact that he had also died for the cause
of human rights in his country. After the meeting the family joined the chargé and A/PAO for lunch.




4. (SBU) Many Kinshasa newspapers reported favorably on the meeting, after receiving a press release (para. 6. below)
and photographs taken at the meeting that were distributed by the Public Affairs Section. Some dailies, including the
independent Le Potentiel, the pro-opposition Le Phare, and the pro-government dailies L'Observateur, Le Forum des As,
Le Palmares, and Uhuru printed the press release verbatim with a photograph. The title of one article read, "U.S.
Embassy Pleads for the Safety of Chebeya's Family." Meanwhile, Forum des As noted that "The U.S. Chargé compared
Chebeya's struggle to that of Martin Luther King," and Le Phare carried a front-page lead that read "U.S. Chargé
Comforts Chebeya's Family." Le Palmares has also a front-page lead that cites the U.S. offer to provide technical
assistance in support of the investigation into Chebeya's killing. Two of these articles are available on line at:

5. (SBU) Comment: The meeting with the Chebeya family served two purposes: (1) to comfort a grieving family whose
members continue to suffer weeks after the death of their husband and father, and (2) to publicly reiterate USG
commitment to the family's security and to calls for an independent investigation. As the local press has reported
extensively on past embassy comments and actions in connection with Floribert Chebeya's death, we believe our public
diplomacy efforts to highlight our concerns over the investigation and the family's safety will continue to receive
continued media coverage. As our public comments have also received the attention of GDRC officials, who have tried
to assure us they are taking the Chebeya matter seriously, we hope our efforts, in concert with those undertaken by
other members of the international community, will help to ensure that the GDRC fulfills its commitment to conduct an
independent inquiry and also provide for the family's security. End comment.

Begin press release




United States Embassy Kinshasa

July 16, 2009




Chargé d'Affaires Samuel Brock hosted Ms. Annie Chebeya, widow of the human rights activist Floribert Chebeya, and
her children at a lunch at the Ambassador's Residence on Friday, July 16. During the lunch, Brock highlighted to the
Chebeya family the important work and life of their deceased husband and father, and how much Americans admired
and appreciated his life's work in defense of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Brock also
reaffirmed U.S. calls on the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to ensure the personal safety of the
Chebeya family, and to assist local authorities in determining the facts surrounding Floribert Chebeya's death and
bringing those responsible to justice.




Among several gifts presented to the Chebeya children were books on the life and work of Dr. Martin Luther King. Brock
told the Chebeya family: "Martin Luther King gave his life so that his people could be free. Martin Luther King had a
dream that all people would be equal. He was murdered and left behind a widow, Mrs. Coretta Scott King, and four
children, aged 15 to 5. He did not live to see the election of Barack Obama as the first African-American president of the
United States. Floribert Chebeya had a dream that the Congolese people would live in a country that respects human
rights. We share that dream, and we intend to continue our work with the government and the people of the Congo to
help make it happen. Floribert Chebeya will not be forgotten, not by the Congolese people and certainly not by his
loving family. But he will also live in the minds of fair-minded people everywhere, including in the United States where
he was much admired. His life and work inspire others to continue in the fight for justice. We will also do all we can to
make sure that you, his family, are safe. Finally we again urge the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo
to insure that a comprehensive, professional, and transparent investigation be conducted into the death of your
husband and father, Floribert Chebeya, and we reiterate to your Government the offer of U.S. Government technical
assistance and expertise in carrying out its criminal investigation of this murder."
