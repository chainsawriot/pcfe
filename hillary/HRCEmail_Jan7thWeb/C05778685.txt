Subject: Arrested US official is actually CIA contractor (AP)


(AP) - The Associated Press has learned that an American jailed in Pakistan after the fatal shooting of two
armed men was secretly working for the CIA.
   The arrest last month of 36-year-old Raymond Allen Davis has caused an international diplomatic crisis. The
U.S. has repeatedly asserted that Davis had diplomatic immunity and should have been released immediately.
   But former and current U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized
to talk publicly about the incident, told the AP that Davis had been working as a CIA security contractor for the
U.S. consulate in Lahore.
   Davis, a former Special Forces soldier who left the military in 2003, shot the men in what he described as an
attempted armed robbery in the eastern city of Lahore.
