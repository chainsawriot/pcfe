Jake,

Just wanted to give you a heads about an issue Jack is going to raise at the 8:45 tomorrow. The National Defense
Authorization Act includes a provision that authorizes $150m for DOD's Task Force for Business and Stability Operations
to carry out economic development projects in Afghanistan.




I've added the text of the legislation for reference. This is Section 1534 (page 548).
