Re: Idea


Off top of my head, quickly, a meme, if you will:

Good not to campaign, good not to go to convention, good on revelations on Bin Laden raid, but should use speeches like
VMI, Naval Academy to establish new pivot, new redefinition of U.S. strength in new era that also redefines the relative
position of others.

Should say there is a new "metric" of international affairs (lots of people like that word, as much as "meme"). You've done
"smart power." Now say that the new metric is international cooperation for the rule of law, civil society and peace. The
key tests are: Iran, Syria and North Korea. Put it to BRICS; use Turkey indirectly as standard to measure them.

In speech, lay out each area specifically in more than abstract rhetoric related to the specific crisis areas: rule of law, civil
society and peace. International cooperation on these crucial challenges are the test for the community of nations today.

By establishing this metric, setting the standards for international conduct and behavior, you make another point: that you
have reestablished U.S. leadership.

That's it.

Re: Egypt constitution and election


SOURCE: Sources with access to the highest levels of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, The Supreme Council of the
Armed Forces, and Western Intelligence and security services.

   UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05794263 Date: 01/07/2016
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05794263 Date: 01/07/2016




         1. On the afternoon of April 10, 2012 the leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB), and its associated
Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) held emergency, secret meetings with their counterparts in the Supreme Council for the
Armed Forces (SCAF) to discuss the action by Cairo's Administrative Court blocking the activities of the 100 person
constituent assembly, which was empowered by the newly elected parliament to draft a new constitution. This new
constitution is seen by both the MB and the SCAF as a vital element in the transition to civilian government planned for
later in 2012. Both groups are particularly anxious to have the powers of the president and the parliament clearly defined
and differentiated. According to an extremely sensitive source speaking on condition of absolute anonymity, MB Supreme
Guide Mohammed Badie and the Brotherhood's presidential candidate, Cairo financier Khairat al-Shater, stated in private
conversations that they were extremely concerned that this step would complicate the transition to civilian rule. The
SCAF officers responded that they are studying the situation carefully to prevent confusion in the presidential elections
and transition to civilian rule. Their concern here is that complications in the election/transition process could lead to
renewed violence throughout the country.
         2. After their initial discussions the MB Guidance Council agreed to allow the parliamentary leaders to pursue an
appeal of this decision while preparing a set of interim guidelines for the new president and the parliament to use in
administering the country in the event the constituent assembly is delayed further. They will coordinate this effort with the
SCAF. Badie was particularly frustrated with the liberal/secular parties, whose law suits led to this delay.
         3. According to this source, these smaller parties felt that the constituent assembly, as chosen by the
parliament, was dominated by the MB/FJP/Salaafist al Nour party and did not reflect the full diversity of Egyptian political
society. The law suits filed by these parties claimed that women, young people, and ethnic/religious minorities are under-
represented in the assembly. According to sensitive sources, many of these secular/liberal groups are concerned that,
under these circumstances, the new constitution will follow the principles of Islamic law more strictly, as it defines the
rights of Egypt's religious and ethnic minority groups, and the balance of power between the president and national
parliament.
         4. (Source Comment: After consultations with the SCAF, Badie and the Brotherhood supporters parliament
intended to hold a national referendum on the new constitution in late April or early May, prior to the first round of voting in
the presidential election, which is planned for late May. According to a very sensitive source, the actions of the
Administrative Court may delay this process and complicate the entire election schedule. The court did not explain its
finding, stating only that it had blocked the implementation of the decision by the speaker of parliament to form the
constituent assembly. The matter has now been referred to a legal scholar, who will advise the court as to how best to
proceed. The MB leaders are still confident that the assembly will go forward largely as they planned, although the
schedule of events may be complicated; a situation they fear could lead to a new round of demonstrations by the
secular/liberal parties, as well as the Coptic Christian community. Badie is concerned that this situation could spur
outbreaks of violence, as all sides become frustrated. He does not want any problematic security situation to encourage
the SCAF to step in and delay the transition to civilian rule. Badie, al-Khater, and the other MB/FJP leaders continue to
believe that they can avoid these complications by maintaining regular contact with the SCAF.)


          5. In addition, this source notes that the secular and liberal parties already withdrew from the assembly and are
drafting an alternative constitution, emphasizing and strengthening article 60 of the interim constitution drafted after the
fall of former president Hosni Mubarak February 2011. This section of the interim constitution guarantees the rights of all
ethnic, political, and religious minorities. For his part, Badie is particularly frustrated by the fact that the MB/FJP/al Nour
coalition in parliament had taken steps to ensure that only 48 of the 100 seats in the assembly were held by Islamists.
However, this was not acceptable to the secular/liberal parties and groups, who believe that even though the Islamists did
not hold an outright majority in the assembly, their overwhelming plurality made it a simple matter for them to find allies
among the small parties in the assembly, and gain the three votes they will need to shape the new constitution as they
wish.
