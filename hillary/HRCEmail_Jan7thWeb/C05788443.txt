Military Intelligence arrest & threatens people who spoke to Amb. Rapp




   •    The people are from the Selvapuram village in Mullaitivu. Ambassador Rapp visited that village yesterday.
   •    The villagers informed Amb. Rapp that during the final phase of the war (in 2009) they handed over their loved
        ones to the Military. But since then they had not heard anything about their relatives whereabouts.
   •    Now the military is forcing them to register their loved ones as dead.
   •    When the information about the meeting became public; the Sri Lankan military intelligence rounded up that area
        and is conducting investigations as to who gave evidence to Ambassador Rapp.
   •    At least 5 people were taken to the military intelligence camp for more in depth investigations. They were also
        issued with death threats.
   •    The priest of the St. Jude's Church where the Ambassadors meeting took place was also detained at the military
        camp.
