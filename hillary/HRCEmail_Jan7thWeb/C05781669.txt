Subject: Iran may release detained U.S. hikers soon (Reuters)



TEHRAN (Reuters) - Iran may release U.S. citizens detained on charges of espionage, their lawyer Masoud
Shafiee told Reuters on Saturday, a day before a scheduled court session for the two coinciding with the second
anniversary of their detention.
    "Tomorrow it will be two years since my clients were jailed ... I believe their already two years in detention
will serve as their sentence," Shafiee said. "I hope it will be their last court session."
    Asked whether Shourd would appear at the session, Shafiee said the court had not demanded that she should
attend. "It is one of the signs. In the previous warrants Shourd was asked to return to Iran for the trials ... but
this time there is no such demand," he said.
    "So far, no permission has been granted to my request for a private meeting with my clients," Shafiee
said.
