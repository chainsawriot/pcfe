Attached is a note from Alex Their on his views on an SRAP replacement.

Also coming your way today are: (1) Dennis Ross' note on his discussions with Molho, and (2) Daniel Rubinstein's
readout of his conversation with Molho. You will see in Daniel's readout that Abbas will be in Brazil for the Roussef
inauguration. You might think about a short pull-aside.

In other news, I am working with Kurt on a concept paper for a China speech in the run-up to the Hu visit.
