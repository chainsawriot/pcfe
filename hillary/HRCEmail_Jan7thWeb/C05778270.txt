according to press. Embassy Stockholm said Swedish authorities have confirmed one of the explosions was a terrorist
incident, and their national intelligence service (SAPO) has taken over the investigation. Police believe the person killed
was wearing a suicide vest. The injured are believed to be innocent bystanders, and Post has confirmed there were no
American casualties. Post expressed U.S. condolences and solidarity with Swedish counterparts. The Embassy issued a
warden message. Media report Swedish police received an email about 10 minutes prior to the explosions, with
recordings in Swedish and Arabic. The messages talked about Sweden's silence over the caricatures of the Prophet
Mohammed by artist Lars Vilks and Sweden's presence in Afghanistan.
