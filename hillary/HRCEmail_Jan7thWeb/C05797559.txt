Update:

• Spoke to the AP reporter, explained that it was neither an attack nor covert

• Realizing how wrong they got it, reporter freaked

• Spoke to Alberto Fernandez and Danny, got the details

• Poor Danny is in Tunis, 5am his time

• Got the reporter on with Alberto & Danny, walked her through it

• Reporter revising the story to reflect reality; I'll send when updated

• This fire drill will get this initiative some good press, so another case of all's well that ends well

Short answer is no.

I'll let Jake address in full, but as I understand it we bought web ads that were a play on anti-US ads. It wasn't a
"cyberattack" and it wasn't "covert"

I'm reaching out to AP to tone it down.

Does this ring any alarms re disclosure?
