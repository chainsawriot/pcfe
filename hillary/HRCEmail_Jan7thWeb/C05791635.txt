I also note that since our announcement that we intend to cut $200,000 in foreign military credits for Rwanda in 2013,
the Dutch have announced the suspension of 5 million Euros in direct budget support to Rwanda and the British Aid
Agency said this afternoon (Friday 7/27) that they intend to suspend $25 million in budgetary assistance pending
clarification of Rwanda's actions in the Congo. The African Development Bank (which is run by a Rwandan) also
announced that it was placing a hold on $30 million dollars worth of loans to Rwanda because of its activities in the
Congo.




I have sent a classified memo to the Secretary on the current situation, but wanted to share with you what we have
been doing today to contain the problem in the eastern DRC.
