Subject:                             Palau but NOT a request



I think Jack thinks I've fanned flames in Palau but I've actually encouraged concessions they've made and have conveyed
their complaints to him and others to make sure their views are understood. The remaining issues are small -- but
significant to them. And the FSOs who've been negative since the Bush Admin. are not the best messengers. I've
advised dialogue at a political level. But this is just FYI.

Congratulations on Chelsea! Puerto Rico still loves her (and you would probably win even more than 2-1 now). Jeff
