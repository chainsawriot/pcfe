- as you know, Petraus would like to speak with you secure. He can do anytime between 645pm and 10pm. We we are
thinking that 7pm will work, right before your drinks with the press.

- we have planned for drinks with the press in the hotel at 7:30pm. The CG, the ambo and his wife will come.

- if you would like to do dinner outside of the hotel, the Harbor House is a 5 minute walk. Beautiful views of the harbor.
Seafood. Comes highly recommended by the ambassador and the hotel.
