Ah, you can take a country out of the colonies but you can't take away the colonial suspicions. What are you hearing
now?

Re: UK/French advisers in Libya


Latest report:


During the week of April 18, 2011 a source with direct access to the Libyan rebel command under the Transitional
National Council (TNC, also known as the National Libyan Council, NLC) stated in secret that senior members of the TNC
are concerned that the announcement that British military advisors will be joining the rebels will give false hope to their
forces. These TNC leaders believe that the approximately ten (10) high ranking British officers will concentrate on
assessing the rebel's prospects for survival while providing the British and French governments with intelligence that will
allow them to make hard decisions on providing aid to the rebels. French officers will also be involved in these meetings.

(Source Comment: Senior TNC officers are concerned that in the end neither the British nor the French will provide
tangible assistance at a level that will make a difference for the rebels. These individuals are particularly bitter about the
French position, since they note that early in the rebellion officers from the Action Group of the French external
intelligence service (DGSE) met with rebel leaders and encouraged them to rise up against Muammar al Qaddafi; while
promising French aid when the fighting began.)

At the same time, these individuals state that DGSE officers continue to maintain a close relationship with rebel
commander, General Abdul Fattah Younus, encouraging him to support French and British diplomatic and economic
plans for post â€” Qaddafi Libya. These foreign officers, in the opinion of knowledgeable sources, work against the efforts
of General (formerly Colonel) Khalifa Haftar to establish himself in the rebel army. The DGSE believes that Haftar, who
lived in the United States for twenty years, is too close to American interests. Again, these individuals find this intrigue
frustrating at a time when the rebellion is in serious danger of failing. They are encouraging the TNC to broaden their
efforts to obtain military assistance.

In the meantime, as the fighting continues, INC military officers in the field report that prisoners captured from Qaddafi's
forces have reported that prior to the initiation of the no-fly zone by the Western powers, ALGERIA provided Qaddafi's
forces with a number of T55, T/56 E T/64 tanks. According to these prisoner interrogations; ALGERIA is continuing to
supply fuel to Qaddafi's forces.

(Source Comment: These TNC officers are frustrated by France's failure to attempt to block these supply efforts. The
Libyans believe France continues to exert a degree of influence in Algeria.)
