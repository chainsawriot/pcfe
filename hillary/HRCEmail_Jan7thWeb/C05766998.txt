agree - point I have been making.

but you should know push is coming from PIR b/c he believes we are putting ourselves at center where we don't belong
so he is pushing them to make clear lines of distinction and that nuance is getting lost in the blame game (particularly
b/c initial stories suggested State had failed to revoke visas
-- which was an inaccurate characterization)

If we don't until you are off train, I am concerned that State not come across as defensive and blame-shifting to NCTC
the way Ian and Pi sounded yesterday. We should say we are investigating and will work w other parts of govt to be sure
we are all as vigilant and effective as possible. Do you agree?
