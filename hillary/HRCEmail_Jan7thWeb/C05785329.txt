Washington (CNN) -- Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee,
as well as those in the equivalent House committees, will be allowed to view the photographs taken of Osama bin
Laden after he was killed, a U.S. official told CNN Tuesday.

The viewings will take place at CIA headquarters in northern Virginia at a time to be decided, the official said.

U.S. Navy SEALs killed the al Qaeda leader last week in an attack on his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, confirmed that the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Armed
Services Committee would be give the opportunity.
