Former UN Ambassador John Bolton Doesn't Believe UN Officials Were Told to Spy

This morning on the nationally syndicated radio show, "America's Morning News," former U.S. Ambassador to the United
Nations, John Bolton, was adamant that he does not believe American officials were directed to spy at the United
Nations. Bolton told co-hosts John McCaslin and Amy Holmes that "I don't believe that cable.... I think it probably came
from somewhere in the intelligence community. I wish we could find that out because it's obviously very damaging."

Ambassador Bolton: "I don't believe that cable. I've read in my career, I've probably read a million cables. Maybe not a
million, but close to it. I have never seen a cable like that. I do not think that is a State Department cable. I think it
probably came from somewhere in the intelligence community. Why it got into the State Department system, I can't
say. Honestly, I don't know the answer to that. But I do not think that state department personnel were being asked to
engage in espionage. I just don't see it. I think that cable got mixed up somehow. I wish we could find that out
because it's obviously very damaging to State Department personnel all over the world if people are worried they are
gong to be filching documents out of their copy machines. But I honestly think that document is not an
accurate. There's something wrong there.
