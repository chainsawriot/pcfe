Thank you Cheryl. So very much.
Someone has called us already from DHS in DC so we're hopefully getting traction. And he (DHS guy) said the correct
thing too re: connecting with PIH to fix the process in the future.
Will keep you posted
Paul said thank you, he did what you said Cheryl and will keep doing so for the rest of his life

I spoke with the dep sec at DHS who will step in and address this situation assuming as is represented that all approvals
are accurate and that the issue is the formal printing of these documents.

Please check have Paul check in with Ken Merten (hold the plane if necessary given that this needs to occur in next 20
minutes). Ken is now on traffic with the Dep Sec (Jane Hall Lute).

Best.

I am so sorry to bother you on a Sunday. And I know we generally think systematic and institutional fixes preferred but I
also know we think if we can fix something we should. This is an example of the latter which illustrates the need for the
former. We - Paul Farmer and all with him- are on a flight leaving at 545- a private plane              and have space
for 2 babies (whom my Dad met when here) who need heart surgery and their mothers and doctors in boston waiting to
admit them and operate- tomorrow. We heard from the local DHS/Customs folks they approved their travel documents
yesterday (after receiving the necessary ID forms- another story). Now thought the Embassy says they can't print them
because they're waiting for approval from DHS in DC?? ie its not a State Dept issue but a DHS/Customs issue. Any ideas
on what we can do? Details below from Cassia)                                                                         We
have probably an hour. So sorry to bother you today. I can call you too or we can call someone directly- if you've any
suggestions. Or??
Thank you
Chelsea

       Glad to hear        made it to Boston. Great news!

       I know yesterday was quite chaotic.




       I have authorized the parole for                   and their accompanying parents.




       This authorization was sent to our Field Office Director Pius Bannis.

       I have sent him Cassia and          phone numbers in Port au Prince.




       Before the children and parents can travel, they will require travel documents.

       These should be obtained at the US Embassy in PaP.

       I will send you more details as I receive them as to how to obtain them.




       Can you please tell me what their flight information will be?




       I just got your phone message re. affidavits. Anyone who might be able to vouch for the relationship between
the parents

       Of                     an write affidavits and sign them. Those who can testify to their birth are preferred, but if   B6
your contact

       At the Comfort would like to do it, that is ok too. You can scan them to my email, or fax.




       If you need to reach me, email is best, as my blackberry seems a bit broken (at least the voice partâ€”it's
sounding like Darth Vader!)




        Best,

                        She's getting off the plane now...I'm still waiting for her, but I
                        spoke to the flight attendants who said she was doing great until the
                        end when she started to have a lot of pain. We're off to BWH as soon
                        as she's wheeled off. More later
