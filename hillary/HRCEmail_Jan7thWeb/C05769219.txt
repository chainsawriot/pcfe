Kenneth- please give us a list of exactly what will be on the barge so we can get it assigned for receipt and delivery to an
NGO. Also need ETA and where the barge will dock in Haiti.

Also we have electricity experts from US Dept of Energy on the ground in Haiti that have been doing an assessment of
the system. Would be happy to get your folks introduced to them via email.

Thank you for all of your assistance,
Maura

Julissa:

Just got back from meetings with President Preval, First Lady Elizabeth Preval and Prime Minister Jean Max
Bellerive. In addition to being thanked by them for our assistance and my conveying Gov. Fortufio's offer to
continue asisting Haiti through USAID, SouthCom and NGO's such as the Red Cross, they emphasized that all
assistance should be "coordinated", which I assured them is being done.

They were particularly grateful that our public utility, PREPA, arrives tomorrow in PaP to begin an assessment
of the power situation and will join a consortium of Dominican and US power companies that will help restore
service. We all agreed that a functioning electric service would bring stability to the city and to the nation.

I reiterated the offer from Gov. Fortutio I'd conveyed in December to the PM in Miami that we'd be available to
assist in Haiti's long-term development, especially higher-ed.

We've postponed the departure of a 6,000-ton barge for late tomorrow or Friday, in order to accomodate
additional,cargo (thouands of tons), to be delivered to a private port in PaP. We need USAID's confirmation
that they or a responsible NGO will receive and handle distribution of the goods.

USAID's response and coordination would be appreciated.

All the best,

Kenneth
