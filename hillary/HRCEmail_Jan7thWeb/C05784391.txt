STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON

Ongoing Situation in Yemen

The United States is deeply disappointed by President Saleh's continued refusal to sign the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) initiative. He is turning his back on his commitments and disregarding the legitimate aspirations of the Yemeni
people.

The concerted efforts of the international community, led by the GCC, have been tireless and all sides have agreed -- on
multiple occasions -- to sign the GCC initiative. President Saleh is now the only party that refuses to match actions to
words. We urge him to immediately follow through on his repeated commitments to peacefully and orderly transfer
power and ensure the legitimate will of the Yemeni people is addressed. The time for action is now.

We are also outraged to learn that earlier today factions loyal to President Saleh encircled the UAE embassy in Sana'a.
They refused to allow U.S. Ambassador to Yemen Gerald Feierstein, ambassadors from the United Kingdom the
European Union and GCC states, the GCC Secretary General and other foreign diplomats to leave the embassy. We
condemn this action and call on President Saleh to meet his international obligations to ensure the safety and security of
all foreign diplomats and their staffs working in Yemen.
