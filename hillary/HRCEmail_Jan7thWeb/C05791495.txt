A new day in Haiti

BY AMBASSADOR KENNETH MERTEN

http://www.state.gov/p/whaki/haindex.htm

I've had the pleasure of spending three tours in Haiti. My first was in 1988, when the State Department assigned me
here as a junior officer. I have since returned to the embassy in 1998 focusing on the economic and commercial sectors
and in 2009 to serve as ambassador. Over the course of my 25 years working on Haiti, I accompanied the Haitian people
through an earthquake, a major humanitarian relief mission, three coups d'etat, two hurricanes, one embargo and at
least four elections.

When I returned as ambassador, I spoke with Haitians about the importance of respect, partnership and responsibility —
all central to the United States' relationship with Haiti. I shared how Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made Haiti a
foreign-policy priority at the outset of her term and about our commitment to help the Haitian people and government
realize their vision of a more prosperous country. I also spoke of the U.S. commitment to a new, and fundamentally
different, approach that we would be taking.

In the past, our assistance did not always yield sustainable results, but moving forward we would shift from aid to
investment — from what America can do to what the Haitian people want their partners, like America, to do, which is
critical for Haiti to thrive.

For months we worked closely with the government to devise a strategy for the bulk of our developmental assistance to
go to four priority sectors: agriculture, governance and the rule of law, infrastructure, and health.

We have leveraged the unique capabilities of U.S. government agencies and are working as one team to dramatically
improve results. We are training Haitian police officers, helping increase agricultural productivity, building feeder roads,
establishing sustainable health systems, building thousands of hurricane resistant shelters, and repairing and expanding
access to electricity. These investments and programs will help Haiti build a strong foundation for future development.

We know that real, transformative change in Haiti — like countries around the world — can only come through private
sector investments driving job creation and providing tax revenue. This was the case on my first day as ambassador and
remains true today. When people have jobs they have the dignity that comes from being able to choose how they
provide for their families and the freedom to make their own choices.

When the government has more revenue, it can fund better schools, hospitals, and roads, and police officers to keep
Haiti's streets safe. President Martelly has made economic development — inside and outside Port-au-Prince — a
priority.

As I leave Haiti, I am encouraged. Haiti has reported a 21-percent increase in foreign direct investment since 2010. In the
north, I saw the completion of the first factory buildings and modern power plant at the Caracol Industrial Park. There is
palpable enthusiasm in the community for the jobs this park will bring, adding more factories over the coming months
and years. Anchored by a $78 million investment from Korean apparel manufacturer Sae-A Co., Ltd., the park has the
potential to create more than 60,000 jobs.

Its second tenant, Haitian paint company Peintures Caraibes, just signed a lease that will allow it to expand operations
by opening a second factory that will ultimately create hundreds of jobs. But, the park is only part of the development
across the northern corridor. Investments in agriculture and reliable electricity, the construction of a new port, schools,
health clinics, and hospitals will fuel additional investments and open new domestic and foreign markets to farmers.

I am proud that the work we have done, and continue to do, helps Haitians build a stronger foundation for a prosperous
future. My time as ambassador has given me a front row seat to history and has allowed me to be a part of a new
chapter in Haiti's story. I will not think of Haiti as a country that faced unimaginable devastation, but rather as a nation
of vibrant, proud, hard-working and courageous people who faced adversity and kept climbing.

It is a nation with a bright future. I look forward to the day when Haiti is independent of development assistance and can
join us in helping other developing nations. When that day comes we will know that Haiti's dreams for its future have
come true.

                Per Cheryl's last question below, Holli did great work putting this together.



                The AP article more or less is citing figures that we provided them. The data itself is accurate; however
                it is the context in which the data is used which is misleading. Below is a chart that distinguishes
                Humanitarian Relief from Recovery & Reconstruction (R&R). Note, the NY Pledge amount is included in
                the R&R total. R&R disbursements include prior year funding, FY 10 Base, FY 10 Supplemental and FY
                11. A separate chart can be generated to show this yet can be confusing.

        It was erroneously posted (and presumably only part of it?). One or two news organizations (as far as I

                US pledge to rebuild Haiti unfulfilled
               Friday, July 20, 2012

               PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — The deadly earthquake that leveled Haiti's capital more
               than two years ago brought a thread of hope: a promise of renewal. With the US taking
               the lead, international donors pledged billions of dollars to help the country "build back
               better," breaking its cycle of dependency.
                But after the rubble was cleared and the dead buried, what the quake laid bare was the
                depth of Haiti's dysfunction. Today, the fruits of an ambitious, $1.8 billion US
                reconstruction promise are hard to find. Immediate, basic needs for bottled water,
                temporary shelter and medicine were the obvious priorities. But projects fundamental to
                Haiti's transformation out of poverty, such as permanent housing and electric plants in
                the heavily hit capital of Port-au-Prince have not taken off.
                Critics say the US effort to reconstruct Haiti was flawed from the start. While "build back
                better" was a comforting notion, there wasn't much of a foundation to build upon. Haiti's
                chronic political instability and lack of coordinated leadership between Haiti and the US
                meant crucial decisions about construction projects were slow to be approved. Red tape
                stalled those that were.
                The international community's $10 billion effort was also hindered by its pledge to get
                approval for projects from the Haitian government. For more than a year then-President
                Rene Preval was, as he later described it, "paralysed," while his government was mostly
                obliterated, with 16,000 civil servants killed and most ministries in ruins. It wasn't until
                earlier this year that a fully operational government was in place to sign paperwork, adopt
                codes and write regulations. Other delays included challenges to contracts,
                underestimates of what needed to be done, and land disputes.
                Until now, comprehensive details about who is receiving US funds and how they are
                spending them have not been released. Contracts, budgets and a 300-item spreadsheet
                obtained by The Associated Press under a Freedom of Information Act request show:
                * Of the $988 million spent so far, a quarter went toward debt relief to unburden the
                hemisphere's poorest nation of repayments. But after Haiti's loans were paid off, the
                government began borrowing again: $657 million so far, largely for oil imports rather than
                development projects.
                * Less than 12 per cent of the reconstruction money sent to Haiti after the earthquake has
                gone toward energy, shelter, ports or other infrastructure. At least a third, $329 million,
                went to projects that were awarded before the 2010 catastrophe and had little to do with
                the recovery -- such as HIV/AlDs programmes.
                * Half of the $1.8 billion the US promised for rebuilding is still in the Treasury, its
                disbursement stymied by an understaffed US Embassy in Port-au-Prince in the months
                after the quake and by a Haitian government that was barely functional for more than a
                year.
                * Despite State Department promises to keep spending public, some members of
                Congress and watchdogs say they aren't getting detailed information about how the
                millions are being spent, as dozens of contractors working for the US government in Haiti
                leave a complex money trail.
                "The challenges were absolutely huge and although there was a huge amount of money
                pledged, the structures were not there for this to be done quickly," said former US
                Ambassador Brian Curran. "The concept of build back better is a good one, but we were
                way over-optimistic about the pace we could do it."
                The US Special Coordinator for Haiti Thomas C. Adams, who oversees USAID spending
                here, says the first priority in the critical days after the quake that killed more than
                300,000 was crisis management, and the US government spent $1.3 billion on critical
                rescue operations, saving untold lives.
                Three months later, the goals shifted from rescue to what would become a $1.8 billion
                reconstruction package aimed at building new foundations.
