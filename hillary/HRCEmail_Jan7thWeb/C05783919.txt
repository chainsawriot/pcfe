Subject: Abbas

Bill, as you head out for your trip to Ramallah, I wanted to share a couple of Palestinian-related comments from the Sir
Bani Yas Forum.
(Imagine: even Mohammed Dahlan is here.)

First, when we spoke yesterday, you asked me to talk with Salam Fayyad about a meeting. Salam believes it's already
been set up, for noon on Monday at the Jericho InterCon. If that's not the case and I need to do something, let me
know.                                                                                                             B1
                                                                                                                   1.4(D)
Second, based on what I'm hearing here (which obviously is shaped by the participants here), it seems to me -- and I
certainly defer to Daniel R and David H for a more considered agenda -- it seems as though reconciliation needs to be a
key part of the discussion with Mahmoud Abbas, and an area where you might have a real impact.

Good luck!
