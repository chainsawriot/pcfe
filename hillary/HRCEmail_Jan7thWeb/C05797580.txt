Dear Chris,

I just heard the good news about your new job w Rubenstein and am so happy for you. I'm also grateful for your service
and support at State and USAID. And, of course, I'm a little jealous that you'll be back in NY before me!

Please stay in touch w me and send me your new contact info when you're settled. All the best, my friend---H
