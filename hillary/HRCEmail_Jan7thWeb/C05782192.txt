Subject: Update

Note: may switch to Siprnet starting tomorrow. A lot of good info, but increasingly granular and can't
share on this system.


Whereabouts

-Q may be in or around Bani Walid, but can't confirm.

-Sayf in Bani Walid

-Mutassim in Bani Walid

-Saadi in Sebha

-Sanussi in Sebha


Military/regime

-Regime continues to lose strength. Airstrikes on Sirte are reducing regime military activity there.

-Waddan commander resigned (removing another obstacle to opposition seizure of CW
facility). Defections in Sebha (including commander).

-Tripoli and Misrata are quiet.

-It appears that Mutassim (formally in Sirte) has joined Sayf in Bani Walid to unite their forces.

-Saadi is likely to enter a neighboring African country in next few days. This is likely the reason he
traveled from Sirte to Sebha (which is on the transit route to Algeria and Niger). However, even in
exile, he may continue to negotiate a ceasefire on behalf of the regime.

-Available evidence suggests that regime's CW materials (primarily mustard gas agent) are diluted
and no longer usable.

-Negotiations with tribes on surrender of Sirte continue. TNC greatly prefers this option, fearing the
bloodshed that would result. Contradictory reports of progress and a temporary breakdown in talks
yesterday. INC concerned they may be forced to strike.


Internal opposition

-Jibril had good meeting with Bel Hajj in Doha in the last week. Now, he thinks he can work with him.
(Note: may have been catering to audience).

-Misrata political leaders suspect that Bel Hajj has a subversive agenda.

-Forces in Benghazi may be running low on weapons due to most having been shipped to Tripoli.

-Residents of Tripoli and Misrata expressing distrust of TNC.

-Multiple indications that TNC is having difficulty coordinating militias for future assaults on Sirte and
Bani Walid. Some appear to be picking up and going home (still a very small fraction), while others
making alternative plans for operations independent of TNC oversight.

-Divisions over UN observer mission continue and there is a growing consensus that Khatib's job is
complete and TNC should only deal with Martin going forward.

-UAE may be looking to cultivate another oppositionist figure to counterbalance Bel Hajj.
