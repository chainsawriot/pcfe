All Obama needs to do is turn up, surrounded by commanders, on the Gulf Coast, post-hurricane, on
Saturday. The hurricane is the counter-convention. It provides the counter message without ever
having to debate it: Obama is effective, gets things done, government is essential, etc. The event is the
message. Plus, on the anniversary of Katrina, the contrast is naturally made, and Bush pops up.

I passed this on to the White House. We'll see what happens.

Re: Hurricane Isaac


    1. The moment George W. Bush's popularity collapsed was in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.
        His decline was not the result of the Iraq War; instead, it was sudden, rapid and unrecoverable
        post-Katrina. Then and only then did his standing on every other issue disintegrate. He was
        washed away by the failure of the federal government to handle the crisis. Memories of Katrina
        are still vivid and searing.

2. Hurricane Isaac will hit the Gulf Coast and possibly veer to New Orleans. As it moves over
   warm water it will gain power.
3. Once the obvious landing zone of Hurricane Isaac is known, probably today, Sunday, the
   administration should immediately—that is, immediately—announce that it has set up a
   command post nearby. The director of FEMA should be sent there immediately to coordinate
   activities.
4. Not only should the FEMA director be on the scene before Isaac hits, but also Vice President
   Biden should be sent to help oversee. Sending Biden would achieve several missions: a. It
   would draw intense media attention to the administration's FEMA effort and maintain that
   focus for days; b. It would raise his stature as a can-do, hands-on, practical team player; c. He
   should be joined next weekend, after Isaac lands and the FEMA efforts are in full swing—after
   the Republican convention and on the eve of the Democratic one—by President Obama.
5. The theme of the Republican convention is the failure of President Obama, not only on the
   economy but also generally as an effective chief executive. The FEMA effort after Isaac will: a.
   Implicitly contrast with the Bush one after Katrina; b. Demonstrate that the Obama
   administration is effective and acts in the public interest by effectively managing government;
   c. Show the indispensability of the federal government without ever having to make an
   ideological case. And:
6. Once the FEMA effort begins, while the Republican convention is meeting, Democrats across
   the board should point out that the Romney-Ryan budget plans would slash FEMA. Even if not
   specified, as little is specified in their plans, drastic FEMA cuts would be inevitable. Put out
   numbers, a range of numbers. Romney-Ryan would at once be forced on the defensive, make
   statements defending their plans, calling attention to the real consequences of their ideology,
   and by filling their message space with the hurricane and the administration's effective
   management the GOP convention message against Obama as ineffectual and for Romney as the
   crisis manager/proven-executive/fixer would be overwhelmed.
