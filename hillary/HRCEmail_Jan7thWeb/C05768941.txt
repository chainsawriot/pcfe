Subject:                        updates




I know world events are pressing in, but thought I'd send an update on the health care story, which I promised
to do.



I spent a lot of times with Robert Pear about 10 days ago and then checked back in with him a couple of days
ago. I gave him everything off the record, with the understanding that he would report out this story in his own
voice. I gave him the FEHBP story, in addition to all of the policies in the bill that were in your campaign plan
(and that weren't in the Obama campaign plan). He was very interested; in our conversation last week, he
indicated that his own reporting preliminarily indicated that the FEHBP idea didn't originate on the Hill. He
has a fair amount more work to do on the story but he seems nrettv excited about it or as excited as Robert
gets.




Also, I meant to tell you this on the phone last week, but I understand               ay be up for an
important job at State. I don't know much of anything about it, and the jo â€¢ may ave been filled by now, but he
was very helpful to the campaign, so I thought I'd send that along.



Finally, I have to put a pitch in for you to speak at CAP. I know John has talked to Cheryl about this a few
times, so I don't mean this as overkill, but as Secretary of State you've been to Brookings for a few events, and
it would be great if you could do a speech at CAP. We are pretty good at driving press coverage for our events,
though of course, you hardly need that assurance.



Hope you had time to rest over Memorial Day weekend, before the crush of events.
