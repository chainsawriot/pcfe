More questions:

Who else in the Congress besides congressmen Reichert and Cantor knew of the Petraeus
investigation before it became public? How many congressional staffers were informed? What roles
did they play in deciding who to inform about it? What were their communications among themselves
and with others outside their offices if any? Did any of them discuss the matter with anyone in the
Romney-Ryan campaign?
Why was Cantor intent on informing FBI Director Mueller of the existence of an FBI investigation
that was already resolved? Cantor would have been keenly aware that his referral put Mueller on
notice that the investigation could not be contained, indeed, was already known, and put pressure on
him to tell James Clapper and to make it public as soon as possible.
What were the internal discussions between Cantor and his staff on his referral to Mueller?
Did Cantor refer the matter to Mueller in order to punish the rogue FBI agent, who informed Reichert
and Cantor? If not, why not?
Did Cantor understand that the FBI agent was acting illegally? Is that why he did not leak the matter
to the press and instead referred it to Mueller in a transparent effort to pressure him?
Did Cantor inform Speaker Boehner? Did Cantor inform Congressman Mike Rogers, chair of the
House Intelligence Committee? Why did Cantor keep them in the dark? What discussions did he have
with his staff or others about who not to inform, as well as who to inform?
When Mueller learned of the illegal leak to Cantor did he launch an internal investigation? Was the
FBI Inspector General informed? Is there such an investigation? If not, why not?
Was the supposedly rogue FBI agent, described in the Washington Post as motivated by his
"worldview," acting alone? Did he discuss the investigation with any individual either inside or
outside the bureau before he went to Reichert and Cantor?
Disclosure of an espionage investigation is a felony. Will a grand jury be empaneled by the Justice
Department?
When will Senator Patrick Leahy, chair of the Judiciary Committee and a former FBI agent, begin an
investigation of this matter?

officials-say/2012/11/12/6ccb325c-2d00-11e2-a99d-5c4203af7b7a_story.html
What remains unclear is why, after it was decided that criminal charges would not be filed, the FBI
informed Clapper about the investigation. Another question is why the notification was made on
Election Day about a case the Justice Department had declined to pursue weeks earlier.
At some point during the summer, the Tampa FBI agent whom Kelley had first approached for help
was taken off the investigation. Frustrated and concerned that an inquiry into what he thought may be
a possible national security breach had not progressed, he got in touch with the office of Rep. Dave
Reichert (R-Wash.). Reichert passed the information on to House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-
Va.).

"I was contacted by an F.B.I. employee concerned that sensitive, classified information may have been
compromised and made certain Director Mueller was aware of these serious allegations and the
potential risk to our national security," Cantor said in a statement.
Cantor contacted FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III on Oct. 31, and a week later Clapper told Petraeus
he needed to resign.
"I don't know if it would have taken this course without Cantor," a person close to the inquiry said.
