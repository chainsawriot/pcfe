         SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON
                          REMARKS ON THE ODDR
                              DECEMBER 15, 2010
                              WASHINGTON, DC




Thank you, Pat, for that introduction. I want to welcome all our guests from
Congress, other agencies, NGOs, and think tanks. Thank you to all my colleagues
from State and USAID for taking time out of your busy day to join us. I would
especially like to thank USAID Administrator Raj Shah, Deputy Administrator
Don Steinberg, and Director of Policy Planning Anne-Marie Slaughter for being
here today. And, it is a special pleasure to welcome back OMB Director Jack Lew,
our former-but-not-forgotten Deputy Secretary for Resources and Management.


Before we get into what this report says and how we will implement it, I want to
thank all of you whose vision, inspiration and perspiration made it possible. Jack,
Raj and Anne-Marie led a great team, including Karen Hanrahan, Bill Burke-White,
Marisa McAuliffe and so many others. Hundreds of people from the State
Department and USAID, other agencies across the U.S. government, Congress and
outside organizations contributed ideas and suggestions. Thank you for your
energy, commitment and ideas.


Let me also note that this week we lost one of our most respected colleagues and
one of America's most distinguished diplomats: Ambassador Richard Holbrooke.
This is a huge loss for our Department and our country, and we are dedicating this
first QDDR to his memory. Because every day, I see many of the qualities that

made Richard great — his love of country, his intellect and determination, his total
fearlessness, and his insistence that we back up our words with actions — mirrored
in women and men throughout the State Department and USAID who hold
themselves to the highest standards of excellence. You, and your colleagues at
posts across the globe, are among the finest public servants our country has ever
produced. From my first day here at the Department, I have been honored to serve
with you and humbled by your effort and energy.


So I am very pleased that so many of you could be here today for what I hope will
be the start of a substantive and sustained conversation about how we can work
better and smarter on behalf of the American people.


To drive that conversation, I am proud today to unveil the first-ever Quadrennial
Diplomacy and Development Review — the QDDR. This is a sweeping effort,
engaging hundreds of people for fourteen months in a process of asking a simple
question — how we can do better? How can we adapt today to a world of rising
powers, changing global architecture, evolving threats, and new opportunities?
How can we look ahead, prepare for, and help shape the world of tomorrow?


The QDDR is a blueprint for how we can make the State Department and USAID
more nimble, more effective, and more accountable. A blueprint for how our
country can lead in a changing world through the use of what I call "civilian power"
— the combined force of all of the civilians across the U.S. government who
practice diplomacy, carry out development projects, and act to prevent and respond
to crisis and conflict.

Leading through civilian power saves lives and money. With the right tools,
training, and leadership, our diplomats and development experts can defuse crises
before they explode and create new opportunities for economic growth. We can
find new partners to share burdens and new solutions to problems that might
otherwise require military action. And where we must work side by side, in
Afghanistan and Iraq but also in many fragile states around the world, we can give
our military the partner it needs and deserves.


Now as you dig into this report, you'll see that it's driven by two over-arching
factors.


First is President Obama's emphasis on fiscal responsibility and efficiency
throughout the federal government. Through the QDDR, we have tried to
minimize costs and maximize impacts, avoid overlap and duplication, and focus on
delivering results. Across our programs, we are redefming success based on
results achieved rather than dollars spent. And this will help us make the case that
bolstering U.S. civilian power is a wise investment for American taxpayers that
will pay off by averting conflicts, opening markets, and reducing threats.


The second factor is a rapidly shifting global landscape. Once, only a handful of
great powers had the clout to shape international affairs. Now power is shared by
a wide array of states, institutions and non-state actors. The information revolution
has brought millions of people all over the world into an ongoing global debate -
and they, too, can influence events, unleash new threats or devise new solutions to
global problems.

As you see in your work every day, today's challenges and opportunities spill over
borders and they blur traditional bureaucratic divides. They are complex and
interconnected. For example, advancing democracy, promoting sustainable
economic growth, and strengthening rule of law in fragile states, are all
overlapping and mutually reinforcing endeavors. They cut across bureaus and
offices. And they demand not just the skills of our State Department diplomats and
USAID development experts but also the expertise of civilian specialists from
across the government. Specialists at the Department of Agriculture know how to
boost crop yields and irrigate fields in Kansas and in Kandahar. Justice
Department experts are adept at strengthening rule of law in countries whose
democracies are young and vulnerable. To achieve our goals—for example,
tipping a fragile state away from conflict and toward stability—all elements of
America's civilian power must be prepared to work together.


The QDDR will help the State Department and USAID adapt to, shape, and stay
ahead of these trends. This is a program of reforms that will fundamentally change
the way we do business.


Let me outline four broad areas of change.


First, we will adapt to the changing diplomatic and development landscape of the
21' century. The State Department and USAID will direct and coordinate
integrated civilian operations that draw on skills and strengths from across the U.S.
government to make a real difference on the ground. That will require working far
more closely with other agencies also active overseas—from planning to
implementation. We will support our diplomats as they reach beyond their

embassy walls to engage directly with foreign publics, the private sector, NGOs,
and civil society — including with women and others who are too often on the
sidelines. And we will ensure that our development experts have the tools they
need to lead projects themselves, not just dispense grants and manage contracts.


At the heart of this effort will be our Ambassadors and Chiefs of Mission, who are
responsible for directing and coordinating U.S. government personnel in their
countries in a unified team. We will empower them and hold them accountable as
CEOs of their missions, enhance their training, allow them to contribute to the
evaluation of all personnel who serve at their posts, and engage them more fully in
policymaking in Washington. We will also privilege experience in and
collaboration with the interagency as criteria for selection of Chiefs and Deputy
Chiefs of Mission.


Going forward, to embrace the potential of civilian power, we will also draw on
the personnel of other federal agencies, when appropriate, before turning to private
contractors. Sometimes contracting makes sense and makes us more efficient and
flexible. But there are core governmental functions that should always be
performed by public servants, not private companies. And we don't necessarily
have to build these functions in-house — they can often be provided by staff at other
government agencies. This change will increase the cooperation among agencies,
save money on overhead, and restore proper government oversight of core
functions.


The second major area of reform is development. I'll say more about this at
USAID on Friday, but a core message of the QDDR, following the President's


                                         5

Policy Decision Directive on Development, is that development is a strategic,
economic, and moral imperative and we must elevate it alongside diplomacy as a
core pillar of American civilian power.


To do this, we will focus our investments in key sectors where we have special
expertise and the ability to make the biggest impact: in food security, global health,
climate change, sustainable economic growth, democracy and governance, and
humanitarian assistance. And we'll emphasize the rights of women and girls
throughout.


At USAID, Raj, Don and their team are practicing high-impact development,
investing in game-changing innovations that can scale up and potentially transform
millions of lives. A new USAID venture capital-style fund called Development
Innovation Ventures has already invested in solar lighting in rural Uganda, mobile
health services in India, and an affordable electric bicycle that doubles as a
portable power source. And that's just the beginning.


We are determined to rebuild USAID as the world's premier development agency.
The USAID Forward agenda, which grew out of the QDDR process, is helping the
Agency recruit, train, and retain top development professionals; reduce
dependency on contractors; and improve oversight and accountability. USAID has
established a new bureau of Policy Planning and Learning to promote innovation,
research, and evaluation, and created a new office charged with developing the
agency's annual budget proposal and overseeing budget execution. We will make
our aid more transparent by, among other steps, creating a new Web-based
"dashboard" that will publish data on State and USAID foreign assistance. And

starting immediately, USAID will take the lead in our major future security
initiative, Feed the Future. These are important steps that will help our
development experts around the world do their work more effectively.


The third key area of change deals with how we work to prevent and respond to
crisis and conflict. A hard-earned lesson of recent years is that the failure of even
the most remote state can have serious implications for our national security.
America's civilian power must be able to strengthen fragile states, stop conflicts
before they start, and respond quickly when prevention fails. We will make
conflict prevention and response a core mission of the State Department and
USAID. For starters, we're uniting our own capabilities here at State under an
Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights, which will
consolidate the diplomatic and operational capabilities needed to prevent and
resolve conflicts and to respond to disasters. And we're creating a new Bureau of
Crisis and Stabilization Operations—CSO, in State parlance—that will coordinate
early efforts at conflict prevention and rapid deployment of civilian responders as
crises unfold.


As we make these organizational changes, we'll be strengthening State and
USAID's ability to lead, support, and coordinate civilian operations that use skills
from across the federal government, and we're also going to be strengthening our
cooperation with partner nations and multilateral organizations like the United
Nations.


Supporting our efforts in diplomacy, development, and conflict and crisis, the
fourth set of reforms will help us all work smarter and better to deliver results for

the American people. This is always critically important, but especially in times of
tighter budgets and limited resources. So we will improve the way we manage
contracts and procurement by rebalancing our workforce, enhancing oversight and
accountability, and emphasizing local leadership. We will create strategies for
regional and functional bureaus, and we will unite all the country-level planning
for diplomacy, development, and broader foreign assistance under a single,
overarching strategy. And we will modernize our planning and budget processes
to ensure that we fund our highest priorities, set benchmarks for performance, and
measure our progress onl:them. We want to make sure that each dollar we spend          rCommented PSI]: Can make this sharper- impose

The changes in the way we work will affect everyone at State and USAID every
day. For example, as part of the QDDR review, we surveyed staff at dozens of
posts around the world and found that they are too often tied to their desks
fulfilling hundreds of reporting requirements mandated by both the Congress and
the Department. I know, try to contain your shock. This can and must change.
So we are consolidating or eliminating duplicative reports, making reports shorter,
and streamlining workloads. At every level, we will ask again and again: how can
we do better?


As we move forward with our reforms, we will harness the power of innovation -
applying new technologies, testing new approaches, and searching for creative
solutions to entrenched problems. We will practice what you've heard me call 21st
Century Statecraft, embracing not just new tools and technologies but also the
innovators and entrepreneurs behind them. We will expand and accelerate our
public-private partnerships, because we recognize that both government and the

private sector bring important skills to the table. We will protect ourselves, our
networks, and our confidential correspondence, through new approaches to risk
management and through reforms like the creation of a new Coordinator for Cyber
Issues.
In short, we are changing the way we do business from top to bottom. But the
story does not end here. The reforms included in the QDDR will only make a
difference if we all work hard to put them into practice. Implementing the full
vision of the QDDR — building capabilities, changing mindsets and modernizing
approaches — will take time, focused resources, and sustained leadership. I am
determined that this report will not merely gather dust, like so many others, so this
will be a priority at both State and USAID.


I will ask the next Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Budget -
hopefully Tom Nides — to bring his enormous talent and energy to the task of
overseeing the QDDR's implementation at State. Administrator Shah will oversee
implementation at USAID. But we won't get very far without your help. So I ask
you, first, to read this report. We've got an Executive Summary for those of you
who don't have time for all 200-odd pages.


And then I hope you will put your talents, your enthusiasm, your ideas and your
practical expertise to work and help us turn this vision of reform into a reality.


And join me in asking that important question again and again: How can we do
better?
