Madam Secretary,
Jake gave me a readout of your Lavrov IAEA conversation-- it was terrific. You moved the needle; now we have to come
through and finish the high wire. Thanks very much. Will keep Jake posted through weekend negotiations. Also, have
already gotten underway USAID strategy for Russia. Finally, your memo on the McCarthy era horrors will be waiting for
you when you return. Comes from historian through Mike Hammer. Hope rest of your many meetings goes well.
Best,
Wendy
