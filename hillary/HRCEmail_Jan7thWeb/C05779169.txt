They are saying 945 doesn't work for Tom. They are asking us re-consider 8:30.

They just told me 8:30 was confirmed. But will go back with 9:45

I'd like to do at 9:45 if possible but can do 8:30 if that's best for Frank.

He's done one mtg with M and one with OS.

I have proposed an 0830 secure call to debrief. Bill believes that you and Tom should hear it first before the cast of
thousands. Would an 0830 secure call work? Earlier? Later?
