I shared some thoughts with              who is Admiral Mullen's policy lead, about the             brief.                   B6

        You found the work of         unit impressive and convincing
        You found the brief extraordinarily sobering — you were struck by the scope and nature of the corruption,
        including the connections to drug trafficking and the links to senior officials
        It illuminated the comprehensiveness of corruption at the most senior levels
        Clearly, the cost of doing business in Afghanistan is very high; perpetrators are some of our most trusted and
        most enlightened counterparts

But this may actually reinforce, rather than call into question, the need for a targeted strategy on high-level
corruption. We need to ask ourselves if we have the level of insight, interlocutors, cultural understanding, and political
leverage to implement a more expansive strategy — and in what timeframe. It is because of these questions that you
and Secretary Gates proposed the corruption strategy outlined in your memo from last fall.

That said, I told him, you remain open to input, especially from ADM Mullen.          just sent me Mullen's most recent
paper on this.
