Ambassador Susan Rice has been an indispensable partner over the past four years. We worked closely together to
secure tough new sanctions on Iran and North Korea, build an international coalition in Libya, and support the
independence of South Sudan. From the National Security Council to the State Department to the United Nations, Susan
has worked tirelessly to advance our nation's interests and values. I am confident that she will continue to represent the
United States with strength and skill.
