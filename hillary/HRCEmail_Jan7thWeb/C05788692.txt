 Re: Intel on planned terrorist attack in Congo on 6/25


  According to a source with a proven record of reliability:

 On June 25, 2011, the city of Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), will be
 attacked by insurgents from the Enyele clan, who have been trained in Angola and outside of
 Brazzaville, Republic of Congo. The attack is planned as a follow up to the February 27, 2011
 raid on the residence of DRC President Joseph Kabila in Kinshasa. The Enyele insurgents
 stepped up operations in the Equateur Province in anticipation of the upcoming November 2011
 Presidential elections. The leaders of the Enyele and other ethnic groups believe that Kabila and
 his supporters will arrange to guarantee his reelection through voter fraud and the intimidation of
 opposition supporters.

  (Source Comment: The source noted that the Enyele normally attack government facilities, but
  if they cannot reach one of these targets, they will not hesitate to turn on targets of opportunities,
  including wealthy Congolese citizens, western businessmen, their families and facilities.)

  This latest round of fighting is an extension of the violence that began in Equateur Province in
  late October 2009, involving two rival clans over a long-standing dispute over fishing rights.
  During the fall of 2009 Enyele fighters killed approximately 45 police officers sent to the area to
  restore order. The Kabila government responded by sending a special, Belgian-trained brigade to
  the area, and the UN military command (MONUC) shifted some of its resources from North and
  South Kivu Provinces along the Rwanda border to the Equateur region.

  In the past nine months, over 120,000 Congolese citizens fled from Equateur to the neighboring
  Republic of the Congo. In the North approximately 20,000 people crossed into the Central
  African Republic to flee the fighting. There are over 30,000 internal refugees in and around
  Kinshasa, and humanitarian assistance for these refugees remains difficult because of
  geographical obstacles and fears of renewed fighting. On April 4, 2010, a group of Enyele rebels
  attacked the provincial capital of Mbandaka, killing at least 16 people, after hijacking a
  riverboat. They held the airport for a day before the arrival of MONUC soldiers. There were

 reports of reprisals by the Armed Forces of the Congo (FARDC). The ensuing violence caused
 further refugee movement across the Ubangi River into the Republic of the Congo. In June 2010,
 Enyele leader Odjani Mangbama was captured and arrested by authorities in Brazzaville, who
 began negotiations for his extradition to the D.R.C. Following Odjani's arrest, the fighting
 abated until a new series of attacks began in January 2011, highlighted by the attack on Kabila's
 residence in February by dozens of armed Enyele fighters.
