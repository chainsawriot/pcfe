Gentlemen,




Senator Graham just called me about ten minutes ago and asked that Ito deliver this message to both of you and to the
Kurds (I will not tell the Kurds anything unless you tell me so). He was outraged and said "Sadi I just want you to listen
until I finish telling you our message".

1.   "The outcome is a disaster and an Iranian victory because of Talabani the Iranian.... Such and such and such
became President against America's will".

2.   "This is a big slap on America's face by the Kurds "we made it clear to Barzani that Talabani is a no go and he gave
him as he requested the choice of another Kurd if he cannot deliver on Allawi. I was there when the Presidents letter
was delivered to him. This not acceptable. We will not stand for our President to be humiliated and marginalized"
Senator Graham said.

3.   "We will cut all funding to the Kurds and ask to pull our troops from their areas and if need to be from Iraq and
send them somewhere else if need be".

4.   After I told him to be patient and look at this as an inclusive coalition and Allawi is in as Chair of NCSP. "He said I
do not care about the internal politics of Iraq at this point and will not back down from my position. I will not stand for
what Barzani and Talabani did to our President and America".

5.   "Senator McCain and I will be going on the Sunday shows , this coming Sunday and will say what I am telling you
now on TV".

6.   "Senator McCain and I will bring this issue to the Republican Conference and have the whole conference take the
same position". "Not one dime for Kurdistan and Barzani needs to know this and very soon"

7.    "Sadi deliver this message to the General and the Ambassador and the Kurds".




I tried very hard to push our position (as of yesterday), but he did not want to hear it and said "Sadi I have a lot respect
for you, but I totally disagree and I told you Sadi at the Airport that we will be doing this if Talabani the Iranian guy is
elected. I am sorry but I have to get of the phone, please deliver the message" Senator Graham's last words to me.
