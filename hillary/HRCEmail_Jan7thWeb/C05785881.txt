Re: Syria aiding Qaddafi


This memo has two parts. Part one is the report that Syria is providing air support for Qaddafi. Part two is a note
to Cody from Lord David Owen, former UK foreign secretary on his views of an increasingly complex crisis. It
seems that the situation is developing into a protracted civil war with various nations backing opposing sides
with unforeseen consequences. Under these circumstances the crucial challenge is to deprive Qaddafi of his
strategic depthâ€”his support both financial and military.


  I.      Report
During the afternoon of March 3, advisers to Muammar Qaddafi stated privately that the Libyan
Leader has decided that civil war is inevitable, pitting troops and mercenary troops loyal to him
against the rebel forces gathering around Benghazi. Qaddafi is convinced that these rebels are
being supported by the United States, Western Europe and Israel. On March 2 Qaddafi told his
son Saif al-Islam that he believes the intelligence services of the United States, Great Britain,

Egypt, and France have deployed paramilitary officers to Benghazi to assist in organizing,
training, and equipping opposition forces. Qaddafi is convinced that the National Libyan Council
(NLC), and its leader, former Minister of Justice Mustafa Mohamed Abdel Galil have been
chosen by the foreign powers to replace him. On March 1 advisors to Qaddafi stated that
Qaddafi's cousin, Col. Ali Qaddafiddam had failed in efforts to recruit fighters among the
Egyptian population living immediately across the border with Libya.

These individuals added that during the week of February 21 the Libyan Leader spoke to Syrian
President Bashir al-Assad on at least three occasions by secure telephone lines. During the
conversations Qaddafi asked that Syrian officers and technicians currently training the Libyan
Air Force be placed under command of the Libyan Army and allowed to fight against the rebel
forces.

(Source Comment: Senior Libyan Army officers still loyal to Qaddafi added that On February
23, President Assad told General Isam HaIlaq, the commander in chief of the Syrian Air Force,
to instruct the pilots and technicians in Tripoli to help the Libyan regime, should full scale Civil
War breaks out in the immediate future.)

On March 24 a military officer with ties to Qaddfi's son Khamis stated privately that the number
of Libyan pilots defecting to the opposition has destroyed the morale and professional spirit of
the Libyan Air Force at this critical moment, when Tripoli's air superiority is its principal weapon
against insurgents. In the opinion of this individual Qaddafi and his senior military advisors are
convinced that the European Union and the U.S will impose a no-fly zone over Libya in the
immediate future. These advisors believe that the no fly zone will serve as air support for
opposition forces. They are also prepared for the Western allies to bomb anti-aircraft facilities in
and around Tripoli in preparation for the establishment of the no-fly zone. Foreign Minister
Mousa Kousa is convinced that that Russia and Turkey will oppose the move, and may prevent
the implementation of the no fly zone.

The Syrian soldiers in Libya are part of a mission established in 1984 following the signing of a
military agreement between Qaddafi and Syria's long-time ruler and Bashir's father, Hafez al-

Assad, in the presence of General Soubhi Haddad, who was the commander in chief of the Air
Force at the time. Both Air Forces are equipped with Russian materiel and have had long-
standing, close links with Moscow.

In exchange for Syria's help, Libya provided financial support to the Syrian state, including funds
in support of operations carried out by the Syrian intelligence services in Lebanon. Libyan money
helped Hafez al-Assad bribe his brother Rifaat, the author of an attempted coup d'etat in 1983,
to leave the country and go into exile in Spain and France, where he has remained ever since.

According to individuals with access to the Syrian military, Damascus has also sent a second
team of pilots and technicians to Tripoli. These are lower-ranking officers loyal to the regime
who are specialized in flying helicopters. Before their departure for Tripoli on February 23, they
met with General Allaq and General Jamil Hasan, head of Air Force's Intelligence.

(Source Comment: During the afternoon of 3 March, an associate of Saif al-Islam Qaddafi
stated that he and the Libyan leaders other family members were concerned over the
announcement of Jose Luis Moreno-Ocampo, chief prosecutor of the International Criminal
Court (ICC), announced that he was investigating Qaddafi, his sons Khamis, the commander of
the 32 battalion, and Montasem, as well as the head of Gadhafi's personal security detail, the
Director-General of the External Security Organization (Abuzaid Dorda), the spokesman of the
regime (Musa Ibrahim), and the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Mousa Kousa). This source added
that Saif al-Islam had said that Qaddafi himself found the announcement amusing.)

   Cody,

   Realistically the UN will not authorise a no fly zone while Gaddafi continues to hold off bombing and
   strafing but keeping it up front and on the military agenda keeps him worried. Yet for a few frustrating months
   that ambivalence kept the Serbian aeroplanes on the ground before we acted. My hope is that preparations
   continue with visuals of planes flying off carriers, airborne early warning planes flying and people with clout
   outside the Administration demanding preparations. But and it is a big BUT what else can and should we be
   doing? Encourage humanitarian ships and convoys from Egypt to bring in supplies since we must ensure the
   cities in the East can hold up living standards, maybe for months. More adventurous, Egyptian Special Forces to
   go in and advise, even supplying hand held missiles. It appears they have few missiles; the military in the East
   having been deliberately kept ill-equipped. There is old Nasserite sentiment for a Federation of Egypt, Sudan
   and Libya. I know some will say Egypt has enough problems and they should stay resolutely focused on
   domestic reforms. it is delicate but words alone and the balance of advantage will slip to Gaddafi. A Gaddafi

victory   is possible and needs to be weighed in the balance now when deciding what to do.

I'm more worried than I am ready to say publicly.

Yours
David
