Has this statement now gone out? From State or Embassy?

Cheryl

Waiting final confirmation but believe this will be final text

It will go out as an Embassy Tokyo release coupled with an NRC statement

Task Force will wrap both into the CA Travel Notification System

//

At this moment thought of an Authorized Departure back on the shelf

                                                                                                               B5
