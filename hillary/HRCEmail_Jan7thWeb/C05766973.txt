Subject                             Budget update



We are very close to settled with OMB.

In addition to the               in fee generated revenue, we have an additional                 in new money and the are
providing an additional                directly to Treasury for the multilateral foo               isneanstht of the
        that you discussed with the President, the budget will reflect          of new resources             in State and
               in Treasury). The one condition on the top line is that the State/USAID percentage increase cannot be
greater than Defense — which is now 3 percent, which is why part of the multilateral food assistance funding is going
directly to Treasury. As they work through the details of the numbers, this is the one place that we could face a last
minute issue if the percentages get out of alignment.

In terms of policy this has all of the restorations to initiatives that we discussed last week and also adds               to
MCC (OMB made this part of the agreement). In food security, with the combination of                        from State/USAID
and                in new money will add                   to the multilateral initiative; we will fund the nutrition component
within the State/USAID levels. Global engagement will be funded at                        of new money and we will be able to
restore the proposal to increase in State and USAID staffing. While the staff increases will be funded at 50 percent of
the originally proposed levels, with carryover balances because prior year appropriations were delayed there will be
a very strong continuation of new recruitment. It should feel like we are on track and will add much needed capacity —
much better than a pause.

While we still have a risk that the fee proposal may not be accepted, we now have              of cushion in new State
ops funding which means our absolute risk vs. current levels is only            We also get the upside that any
additional fee revenues above projections will come to State and the permanent transfer of revenues, if enacted, will
provide long term stability in State ops funding.

I talked to Karl yesterday about Afghanistan funding and I think he appreciates that we have made big progress, but he is
still thinking about weighing in on the need for full funding. I told him that we expect funding levels that will permit us
to increase the monthly program level from roughly                                   with front loaded funding to permit
stable planning for the next 18 months. I told him that the proposed settlement made it much harder to make a
compelling case and he is weighing whether the principle of full funding of the field defined requirements is an issue
that he wants to be firm on. He understands that we went to the mat on this and he understands the character of the
arguments we faced.

I think Richard will be disappointed that the Pakistan funding level is at Kerry-Lugar-Berman levels and not higher.

Overall In a year when domestic agencies are being pressed very hard this should be seen as a big investment in State
and USAID. I started laying a foundation at the staff meeting this morning so our team has a context as they finalize the
budget documents with their staffs.

I hope this is the final budget note for the year. Best to you and your family for a happy and healthy new year.

Jack
