All:

State of play: as I understand it, there are credible rumors and indications that JBA will return to Haiti this week before
the elections - from S.A. indicating that they are considering three dates, one of which is before the election; to the
inquiry re permitting transit visas, to indications that they are packing and looking to relocate children to new schools
with Monday serving as their last day in school.

Kim Ives one of these so-called journalists who is close to JBA posted on twitter the 17th and that he will be on a South
African jet.

it sounds very credible since I am hearing that the South Africans want a direct flight rather than a stop over in Cuba or
Venezuela, both of which were floating around. I hear through other diplomatic channels a delegation of Venezuelans
arrived here a few days ago in anticipation of his arrival. But we are checking...will keep you posted.

You realized that from here on out, it will be rocky -- as far as stability goes. Whether the elections happen or not, this
sense of calm is done. What a country.
