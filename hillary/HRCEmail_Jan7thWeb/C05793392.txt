Dear Anne,


He called me about his son and I told him you were working on it. And that we hoped to keep it quiet until you could
resolve. Ops has his number if you want to contact him directly if there is any news to share.

When I spoke w FM Amr this morning, he said he understood how important it was for our whole economic and security
agenda to resolve the NGO issue. Roiling the waters further over LaHood's son is not, however, the kind of positive step
we were hoping to see!

Thanks for all you're doing, Hillary
