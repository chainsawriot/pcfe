Subject: Raj's Jordan trip to highlight humanitarian assistance to Syrians

Team -                                                            Raj agreed to go to Jordan instead, where we can
also amplify our messaging to Syrian opposition outlets and Pan-Arab press                              Raj is           B5
planning to go after the Riyadh Yemen Donors conference and be in Amman next Tues-Thurs.

                                                                                                                         B5
                                     This deliverable would be a good press hook to get greater play out of the visit.

PA is coordinating with Emb Amman's press team and providing support with our regional media hub director now on
the ground in Amman, plus we'll also work to get footage of the visit to the camps that we can push out, including
through social media.
