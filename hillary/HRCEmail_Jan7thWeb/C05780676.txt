Subject: Contractor case has stalled U.S.-Cuba rapprochement (Reuters)

HAVANA - Cuba's Supreme Court will hear oral arguments Friday on an appeal by jailed American aid
contractor Alan Gross against his 15-year sentence for crimes against the Cuban state.

    It is the latest step in a politically sensitive case which has stalled efforts to improve U.S.-Cuban relations.
                                                                                                â€¢
