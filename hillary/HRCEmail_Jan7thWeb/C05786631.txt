Subject: Crocker Update on PRT Attack
Importance: High

Huma,

Ryan Crocker just called with an update on the attack against PRT Kandahar, and asked that we pass to S before her
testimony.

•   The situation has not been resolved. The attack against PRT Kandahar is ongoing, and there continues to be small
    arms fire, though it is unclear whether it is the Afghan National Security Forces firing at the insurgents, or the
    insurgents firing at the PRT.

•   There are conflicting reports about the number of U.S. and Afghan security forces who have been wounded.

•   No RPG rounds are impacting on the compound (i.e. they are missing the targets).

•   All COM personnel are secured by U.S. soldiers, and Ryan feels they are as safe as they can be given the
    circumstances.

•   There are reports than at least one insurgent has been killed, but as the situation is ongoing, this can NOT be verified
    at this time.
