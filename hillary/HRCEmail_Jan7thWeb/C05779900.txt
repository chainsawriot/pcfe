Re: Option on WMD

Depending on the state of play within the U.N. Security Council, it might be useful to think about generating a
statement from the UNSC that any officer or government official in the chain of command in Libya who is
involved in deploying or using WMD would be subject to war crimes and crimes against humanity prosecution.

This option might have the effect of intensifying pressure and creating further splits between Qaddafi and his
remaining loyal generals. His senior officials should be made to understand that they still have a choice of
whether they will personally go down with him. There is probably some urgency if this option were to be
adopted before the opposing forces converge.
