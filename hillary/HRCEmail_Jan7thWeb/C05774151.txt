Great. I just spoke with Phil and he agreed that we can work in some additional language on institutional reform with a
proviso to the effect of "Secretary Gates will have more to say about this subject when he speaks to you tomorrow."

Best,
Tomicah

Thanks. I'll wait for the next draft. I'm in no hurry since we're in good shape and agree we need to be sure all views are
heard first.

Phil and his team have been through it once, but they wanted to huddle with No Daaldler at NATO today and fold in
some additional details. Phil was also interested in adding some new material on Russia. We'll come up with some
language on institutional reform as well. Secretary Gates will be addressing the seminar on Tuesday and his remarks
focus almost exclusively on institutional reform, which is why we didn't spend much time on the subject. However, I
agree that we should add some material to reinforce the message. We should have a revised version for you by this
evening.

Thanks,
Tomicah

Is the speech now being reviewed? I think the basics are there, altho I am aware that every word will be parsed. Also, I
think we should endorse institutional reform to support that agenda.
