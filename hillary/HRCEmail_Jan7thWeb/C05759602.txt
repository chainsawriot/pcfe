Please give Bill birthday greetings from Lissa and me!




The development community is despairing. They believe that the longer the agency goes leaderless, the more it de facto
becomes simply a part of the State Department. And however well USAID is being overseen now by State, it is important
to preserve an independent development assistance and humanitarian aid function that is distinct from considerations
that influence diplomatic and foreign policy decisions. There is even a certain "healthy tension" between development
and diplomatic perspectives. Being at the World Bank gave me a fascinating education in the dynamics and differences
between Treasury, State and USAID views and priorities.

Enough on what you already know! I do understand that you're doing all you can to get AID resolved, so I should simply
encourage. So consider yourself cheered on!

Jan--

 I am once again so sorry for yet another devestating loss. You and Lissa are bearing more grief than I can imagine. I
hope she and you are bearing up while letting go.

  Africa was overwhelming on every level. I'd love to talk w you about what I saw and learned. Let's commit to dinner
after Labor Day. What did Lissa decide to do about school?




 How's Jinnet? Is she Peace Corps bound yet?

  So, my dear, I am sending you and Lissa love and strength from afar. I really believe there is a purpose and meaning in
all of this. We just have to figure it out, or, short of that, accept where we are and live w faith and gratitude for the gifts
we've been given. Amen and onward---H

Congresswoman's son-in-law dies snorkeling



August 12, 2009 4:29 PM I UPDATED STORY




The son-in-law of U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky (DAL) died Sunday in a snorkeling accident as he vacationed in Mexico with
his family, her office and family said.

Michael McLaughlin, 38, was with Schakowsky and other family members near Tulum, Mexico, at the beginning of a
week long vacation, Schakowsky's husband Robert Creamer said.

McLaughlin was married to Lauren, 35, who is the daughter of Schakowsky's husband and his previous wife Day Piercy,
who lives in New York.

McLaughlin was a filmmaker and editor who lived with his wife in Queens, N.Y.

Creamer said he and other family members were in their hotel near Solinon Bay when another guest with binoculars
told them there appeared to be a problem with McLaughlin, who was snorkeling in the bay about 7 miles north of
Tutu m.

Creamer was the first to reach McLaughlin in .a kayak. He said he found his son-in-law face down in the water, and called
out to him but got no response. Creamer said he got closer, turned his son-in-law over and realized he was in trouble. He
administered mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and put a life vest on him, Creamer said.

"I yelled at him and poked at him and got no response, so I turned him over and it was clear he wasn't breathing," said
Creamer.

McLaughlin's wife then showed up along with Schakowsky and others in more kayaks to help put McLaughlin on a kayak
in the nearly 7-feet of water. Others also arrived in more kayaks to assist and pulled the craft carrying McLaughlin onto
the beach where they continued to try to revive him unsuccessfully.

McLaughlin was pronounced dead at a local hospital a short time later, Creamer said.

In a phone interview from Mexico, Creamer said McLaughlin was an experienced snorkeler and diver who liked to
snorkel alone, a coroner's report said he had aspirated in his mask and died of asphyxiation, he said.

McLaughlin was cremated, following his own request, Creamer said.

Creamer described himself as heartbroken and praised his son-in-law and the 7-year marriage to his daughter. The
couple had planned to adopt their first child in September.

"Michael was one of the most loving and creative people I've ever met.... and he and my daughter Lauren had one of
the most loving marriages I have ever seen," Creamer said.

In 2005 Schakowsky's daughter-in-law Fiona died of cancer. She had been married to Schakowsky's son Ian.

Born Oct. 26, 1970, in Berkeley, Calif., McLaughlin was the oldest of three children and grew up in "the shadow of Mount
Tamalpais, in Mann County," according to Creamer.

As a young man, McLaughlin was known for his love for the outdoors as his dinner table quips that entertained his
family. As a young adult, he attended Sarah Lawrence College where he studied theater and moved with a friend to New
York City, following college.

His family said McLaughlin never lost his zest for adventure, regularly white water rafting, skydiving, backpacking and
studying Karate.

McLaughlin later moved to San Francisco, where he met his wife Lauren and married her in July 2002. During their
marriage, McLaughlin helped his wife start her own business and she helped him pursue his film career as a filmmaker,
his family said.

During McLaughlin's career he worked in live theater, puppetry and short fiction. His short film "Shadow Puppets of
Doom" was shown in film festivals and won the "Best Screenplay" award in the Mann County Film Festival, his family
said. At the time of his death he was filming a pilot reality television show.

McLaughlin is survived by his wife, Lauren Creamer McLaughlin, his mother, Rohana, his sister, Halima, and his brother,
