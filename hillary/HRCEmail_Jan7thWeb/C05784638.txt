I just wanted to tell you that the interagency clearances for the National Action Plan and Executive Order are completed,
so we are on our way. Both will be released by the WH on Monday before your GU speech.
We are inviting a large community of interest. You will be able to keep the commitment you made in the Security council a
year ago!

Secondly, on a related topic -South Sudan. There are several women leaders from South Sudan participating in the
Engagement Conference -- it is a first facilitated by USG. For the last 2 days, the women have been getting trainings and
pounding out the recommendations they will deliver to the conference. These are impressive women who have long been
engaged in the peace/independence movement. Tonight at a reception we hosted, Princeton Lyman and Don Steinberg
both spoke eloquently about the critical importance of their participation. Tom'w you will announce deliverables to support
their efforts.
On Monday, they will attend your announcement of the NAP.
