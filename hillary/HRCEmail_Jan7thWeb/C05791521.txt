In case you don't already have the below... a list of announced officials. Tracks w what I Sent last night.

The (To be confirmed) Sports Minister Rania Elwany would be a third woman.

Mekky, the justice minister, is one of the reformist judges I mentioned (who had previously refused, I
heard). Per Reuters: "Last month, Mekky showed his strong support for the new government by giving the legal
justification for the recall of the Islamist-dominated parliament on several television talk shows."
