Subject: Oman plane to Iran amid bail efforts for Americans (AP)

  MUSCAT, Oman - (AP) An official with Oman's foreign ministry says the Gulf nation has sent a plane to
Tehran amid efforts for a bail-for-freedom deal for two Americans jailed for spying.
  Oman played a similar role in bringing a third member of the group, Sarah Shourd, from Iran last year after
payment of $500,000 bail.
  The Omani official gave no further details Wednesday on the possible release of Shane Bauer and Josh Fatal,
who were detained along the Iran-Iraq border in July 2009. The Omani official spoke on condition of anonymity
because of the sensitivities of negotiations.
  Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said the Americans could be released within days on a total of $1
million bail. But Iran's judiciary says the plan was still being reviewed.
