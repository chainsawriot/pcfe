Dear Jack--

I am honored by the Fordham invitation and we are looking at whether I can reliably agree to a date so far ahead. I have
had to reject commencement requests the last three years because of the uncertainty of my schedule. So I will try hard
to make a timely decision. I'm copying Lona Valmoro who oversees my schedule.

I agree we need a catch-up visit and we'll work on that too. All the best--H

Hillary,




I attached a request from Fr Jim McShane, President of Fordham University, my alma mater, and where I am a trustee,
inviting you to provide the commencement address, for their law school graduation in May, 2012.




All the best, Jack
