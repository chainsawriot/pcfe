Before the mutiny, M23 was integrated into the Congolese Army from the CNDP, a Rwandan-backed militia that had
been fighting in the Eastern Congo for years. So there is a long history here, involving minerals, former safe havens for
armed groups responsible for the genocide, and other calculations.

It's not clear what M23's endgame is, but part of the precipitation of this fighting was the ICC indictment of their leader.

They say that the Uruguayan contingent has been sent out to fight if necessary, but we'll see.

That's as much as I know of a murky situation, but we'll get more from Johnnie.

What is Kigame/M23 trying to achieve in E Congo? Do they intend to hold territory? Negotiate for some outcome? Settle
scores? Do we know?

And will the UN troops do anything?

I also note that since our announcement that we intend to cut $200,000 in foreign military credits for Rwanda in 2013,
the Dutch have announced the suspension of 5 million Euros in direct budget support to Rwanda and the British Aid
Agency said this afternoon (Friday 7/27) that they intend to suspend $25 million in budgetary assistance pending
clarification of Rwanda's actions in the Congo. The African Development Bank (which is run by a Rwandan) also
announced that it was placing a hold on $30 million dollars worth of loans to Rwanda because of its activities in the
Congo.

I have sent a classified memo to the Secretary on the current situation, but wanted to share with you what we have
been doing today to contain the problem in the eastern DRC.
