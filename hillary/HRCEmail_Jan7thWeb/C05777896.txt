Probably below your radars. but do let the Secretary know that it was her intervention in Munich that freed this man. Great
news.

Dear Mr. McFaul:

We are incredibly happy to inform you that my husband, Arkadi Gontmakher has safely arrived
back home.
Thank you very much for your concern and support.

We will make a statement very soon.

Thank you again for the opportunity to present my husband's case at your offices. I hope this
matter provide yet another example of the corruption and lawlessness of the Russian judicial
system.

Respectfully,
Lena Gontmakher
