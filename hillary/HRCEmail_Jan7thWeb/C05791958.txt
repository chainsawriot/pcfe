Agree completely on                            and the salubrious effects of distance from DC!




Best to you           -H                                                                                                  B6

Sorry I wasn't much help on secure conference call today -- wonders of modern technology.

I talked subsequently to Wendy and Jake, and think where you came out on                 subject is exactly right.        B5




Hope you've had chance to relax a little. It's so nice being away                     -- puts DC in better perspective.   B6

All best,

Bill
