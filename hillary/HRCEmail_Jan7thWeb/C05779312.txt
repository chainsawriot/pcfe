  Re: Latest Libya intel


  There's a lot of fresh intelligence here. On the first item (marked unconfirmed), I have heard
  from an independent source (a former Qaddafi counselor) that it is accurate.

  European security officials have received unconfirmed (repeat unconfirmed) reporting that
  Muammar Qaddafi has order the commanders of the Libyan Air Force to develop plans to
  destroy the Libyan oil facilities in the event he is killed or driven from the country. According to
  this source the Air Force officers were stunned by what they describe as Qaddafi wanting to
  leave nothing behind for his enemies. These officers do not believe they can find pilots to fly
  such missions.)


 (Source Comment: Senior advisors believe that Muammar Qaddafi may lose control of Tripoli
  in the next five (5) days, in which case he will be forced retreat to his fortress in the southern
 desert, from which he can fight on for some time, supported by loyal followers and mercenaries.
 His hope in this case would be that the various tribal councils now being set up as parts of a
 potential interim government will begin fighting with each other, allowing him to stage a return
 to power in the future. Qaddafi discussed this situation with two of his sons Montasem and Saif
 al-Islam Qaddafi (living in London.) It is this possibility that Saif al-Islam is referring to when
 he has warned of civil war on several occasions. In this regard, Qaddafi is counting on the
 support of Chad's President Idriss Debi, who was able to defeat the forces of his predecessor,
 Hussein Habri, only with Qaddafi's aid and support in 1990-91.)


 Overview: As of February 23 an official of a Western security services stated privately that as
 many as 1,500 people have been killed in fighting between Libyan forcesâ€”augmented by
 mercenaries from a variety of African countries--and anti-government demonstrators. (Source
 Comment: This official adds that members of the family of Muammar Qaddafi attempted to fly
 to Malta on February 23, but were turned back by Maltese authorities.) At the same time, senior
 European officials believe that as more members of the security forces go over to the opposition
 Qaddafi may lose control of Tripoli, at which point he will be forced to retire to his fortress in
 the Southern desert.


  A senior official of the Libyan External Security Organization (ESO) stated privately that
 Qaddafi believes he has lost control of the majority of troops in the Libyan Army, and he no
 longer trusts the National Guard, the Peoples Militia, the Navy, and even his old colleagues in
 the Air Force. Qaddafi continues to have confidence in the ESO, and his Presidential Guard.


 Over the weekend of February 19 Army Major General Mahmoud Suleiman, commander of the
 Tobruk garrison, warned Qaddafi's son Montasem that his troops would not continue to fire on
 demonstrators and that many of his men were defecting to the opposition. In turn, with his
 father's agreement, Montasem made contact with security officials in Chad, Benin, Nigeria, and
