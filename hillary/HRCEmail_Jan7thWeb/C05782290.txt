Subject: Update

Battlefield

-Regime forces still in southern Tripoli, Zuwara, Sebha, Bani Walid, and Sirte.

-Regime appears to be having difficulty locating all of its remaining forces.

-Rebels slowly cutting off escape routes from Tripoli and are making progress in Sebha.

Whereabouts

-Still nothing on Q. Can't corroborate or repudiate claims that rebels have surrounded him.

-Khamis is fighting in Tripoli. He may be the one surrounded by rebel forces in an apartment complex.

-Mutassim is commanding regime forces from Sirte.

-Saadi is trying to leave Libya, in consultation with French private citizen.

-Saddam's daughter is still working on behalf of Q's daughter to get her and her children out.

International

-South Africans plan to oppose TNC recognition at AU summit and insist upon formation of unity
government.

-Qataris continue to promote Bel Hajj (LIFG) as a leadership candidate.

Internal

-Bel Hajj was named head of Tripoli military council, despite Jebril's promises to the contrary. Instead,
he formed a parallel, alternative military command in which Bel Hajj is just a member.

-High-value regime targets who have surrendered are being treated as prisoners, contra defectors,
by the TNC. It seems apparent that INC is saying, "If you haven't joined us, it's too late."
