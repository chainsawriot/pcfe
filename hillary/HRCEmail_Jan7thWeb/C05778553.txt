Subject: Pakistan court declines ruling on CIA case (AP)

LAHORE, Pakistan - (AP) A Pakistani court declined to rule Monday on whether a detained CIA contractor
on trial for killing two Pakistanis has diplomatic immunity as the United States insists, saying it was up to the
court hearing the criminal case to decide.
   Washington had been hoping for a clear decision from the Lahore High Court that would pave the way for
the release of American Raymond Allen Davis. His detention has exposed the fragility of ties between Pakistan
and the United States, an alliance the Obama administration has been seeking to strengthen to help end the war
in Afghanistan.
