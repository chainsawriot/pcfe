I hope you all had a nice weekend. EAP                                is carefully preparing for the upcoming visit of the
Secretary to Asia and the Pacific. We are taking steps to ensure that we have the appropriate people at every stop and
on every leg.

                                                                     So, here is the EAP staffing proposal for upcoming
movements and stops:

    1)
    2)

    3)
    4)

We are meeting          later today and Tuesday to go over all dimensions of the trip — including overarching
messages, resources, and deliverables — and we will provide detailed drafts to Jake and co. in the next day for
consideration.

 Please be in touch for any further clarification or more details.

 Best wishes, Kurt.
