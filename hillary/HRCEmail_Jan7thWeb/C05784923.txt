Subject: Afghan soldiers called in NATO airstrike that allegedly killed 24 Pakistani troops (AP)

PESHAWAR, Pakistan - (AP) Afghan officials say it was their troops who called in NATO airstrikes near the
border with Pakistan yesterday.
   The strikes allegedly killed 24 Pakistani soldiers at two posts along the frontier. The officials say the Afghan
soldiers had come under fire from the direction of those posts. Both Islamist militant and Pakistani troops
operate in the area.
   Pakistan's army says the attack was unprovoked and insists there was no militant activity in the area.
   Pakistan's foreign minister has told Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in a phone call today that the
attack showed complete disregard for human life and has undone all progress in improving the damaged
alliance between the two countries.
   Islamabad has closed its border to the trucks that deliver supplies to coalition troops in Afghanistan. It's also
demanding the U.S. vacate a base that's thought to be used by the CIA to launch armed drones.
   NATO says it is likely that coalition aircraft carried out the attack that caused the Pakistani casualties and it's
conducting an investigation.
