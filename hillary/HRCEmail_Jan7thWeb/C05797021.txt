                                                                      September 28, 2012

        Dear Madam Secretary:

               We applaud your decision to remove from the State Department's list of foreign terrorist
        organizations the group of Iranian expatriates known as MEK. Along with you, we hope this sound result
        promotes the quick resettlement outside Iraq of the former residents of Camp Ashraf who are members of
        MEK.

                As you may be aware, the signers of this letter are a diverse group of U.S. military, political, legal
        and national security officials who have worked in cooperation with and at the direction of the State
        Department and the United Nations to act as trusted third parties to achieve the peaceful closing of Camp
        Ashraf and the protection of its residents. We are therefore grateful for this step and will do whatever we
        can, as we hope and believe you and your department will, to see that the former Ashraf residents,
        temporarily located at Camp Liberty near Baghdad, are safely relocated to other countries. We hope you
        and Ambassador Daniel Fried will continue to call on us for whatever assistance we can provide.

                                                       Yours sincerely,
