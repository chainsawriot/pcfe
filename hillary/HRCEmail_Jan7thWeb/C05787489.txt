Egypt, The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, and Western Intelligence and
security services.


       1. During the morning of December 30, 2011, senior advisors to Field Marshall
Mohammed Hussein Tantawi, the chairman of Egypt's ruling Supreme Council of the Armed
Forces (SCAF) and interim head of state, instructed the Egyptian General Intelligence
Directorate (GID), as well as Military Police and Intelligence officials to step up clandestine
coverage of the workers and associates of the German Non-Governmental Organization (NGO)
the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung (KAS); particularly those working in Cairo and Alexandria. The
Egyptian officials were infuriated by an extremely forceful demarche delivered by the German
Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Egyptian diplomats in Berlin regarding raids carried out against
their offices by the Egyptian army and military police. The German demarche was prepared in
terms that these diplomats considered insulting to Egyptian national sovereignty. One

individual characterized the German position as an order to the Government of Egypt to stop
interfering with the KAS operations.
      2. (Source Comment: According to an individual with sensitive access, one German
official told them in a private conversation that the reaction in Berlin was particularly severe
because German Chancellor Angela Merkel takes a personal interest in the KAS, which is
associated with her ruling Christian Democrat Union. This individual noted that the protests
from the United States and other Western countries were direct and forceful, as expected, but
they did not compare to the level of displeasure expressed by the German officials. The
vehemence of this official German reaction came as a surprise to the SCAF officials. In
addition, these senior SCAF officers believe that despite the NGO raids, these organizations
continue to train and provide clandestine funds to secular/liberal political figures and anti-
military demonstrators in Cairo's Tahrir Square.)
      3. These individuals believe that Tantawi will approve more aggressive surveillance of
German NGO workers and, by extension, the employees of the German Embassy in Cairo. In
the opinion of these individuals, Western NGO workers, banking, business, and diplomatic
personnel should remain alert for this increased coverage by the security services, which may
affect their day to day lives and those of their Egyptian contacts and friends.
