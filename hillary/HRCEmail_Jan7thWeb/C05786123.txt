Subject:                       Schedule for January 3rd-6th (updated)



MS, please find below the updated schedule for next week. A few things of note:

   1. I have you on the 10:00am shuttle down on Tuesday. The only missing piece to Tuesday is
                                                               — we had originally taken it off your      B5
       calendar when we didn't have plans to be in DC.
   2.
   3.                                                     Shuttle back at 7:00pm which is a little
       tight but not impossible.
   4.                                                    — we are invited with a plus one, checking to
        see who is available/best to attend.
