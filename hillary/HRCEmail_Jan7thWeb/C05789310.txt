 Re: Pat Lang's view on Libya


 I prompted Pat to write his views. As you know Pat's protégés are the top officers in the Middle
 East in military intelligence.

 #Libya-What is next?

 Just to clarify my views on the Libyan revolt and its likely progress.

 - Someone has gotten the rebels up off their haunches and headed back to the west. Who that
 someone might be is, at this point, a bit of a mystery. The passage of time will undoubtedly
 clarify that point.

 - The provision of air support to the rebels has made a decisive difference in this civil war. All
 the lawyerly obscurantism about the UN Resolution cannot obscure the fact that a NATO led
 coalition, supported by the US is going to drive Qathafi's forces all the way back to Tripoli with
 the rebels following along behind on the coast road.

 - Qathafi's "forces" are extremely brittle. They have already begun to run from air attacks or

 vehicles. It is not necessary to arm or supply the rebels. Qathafi's disintegrating forces will
 provide the needed materiel as they withdraw.

 - As the rebels approach Tripoli the populace will rise again. How long will all this take? As I
 have written elsewhere, an outside estimate of six months is reasonable. The actuality may be a
 considerably shorter departure date for Qathafi.

 - Am I concerned about an Islamist "takeover" in Libya? No. The chance that Islamist parties
 are likely successors in power in any of the presently disputed countries is minimal. There are
 far too many non-Islamist political forces in all these coutries for the Islamists to rise to power.
 Will they still exist in these places? Yes, but they will not rule. P1
