SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED

IRAN

    •    Iran sent its letter to the IAEA. Does not address our broader concerns about enrichment.

CONGRESSIONAL ISSUES

    •    Focused on the Supplemental this week. Will be a host of amendments, only some of which will be debated.

    •    Admiral Mullen sent a strong letter to Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Ried stressing the importance of fully
         funding State and USAID, noting that to do otherwise puts peoples' lives at risk.

    •    Senate will take up the Defense Authorization Bill. Senator Levin thinks he is close to having the votes to end
         "don't ask, don't tell."

LEGAL ISSUES

    •    Harold is off later this week to Uganda for the ICC review conference.



    •  On Friday, DC Circuit Court said that none those held in Bagram have habeas rights. Unanimous decision. There
       is a loophole, however, if individuals are being held in a zone of conflict for the purpose of avoiding judicial
       review.
                  Classified by DAS, A/GIS, DoS on 11/30/2015 — Class: CONFIDENTIAL — Reason: 1.4(B), 1.4(D)
                  — Declassify on: 05/23/2025
PUBLIC AFFAIRS

    •      Pi said he thought we had done well in the press on the lifting of sanctions against Russian entities.

    •      In terms of the growing drumbeat of criticism of the Administration for its handling of the oil leak in the Gulf, PJ
           thought the failure to accept more foreign offers of assistance (BP has accepted two) will be an issue.

ASSISTANT SECRETARIES MEETING — HIGHLIGHTS

NEA

    •      There will be an interagency meeting today to discuss reaction to the Iranian letter to the IAEA.

     •      Iranian FM is in Mexico today.

AF

      •     Johnnie reported that he had a good trip to Uganda, Ethiopia and Turkey last week. In Uganda, he and Vann Van
            Diepen met with                                                                                                   1.4(D)

                                                                                                                              1.4(B)

      •     In Ethiopia, the elections yesterday involved a generally good turnout. Meles' party will win, but don't
            anticipate the same level of violence as after the last election.

      •     In Istanbul, the Turks hosted a conference on Somalia. Johnnie noted that the greatest threat to the TFG right
            now is not Al Shabaab, but in-fighting among the tribes.

      •     The ten pirates in U.S. custody will be turned over to the TFG via Djibouti.

      •     Ellen Johnson Sirleaf will be here later this week.

EAP

      •     Reviewed President Lee Myung-bak's address today and the tough measures he outlined, including suspension
            of trade and foreign assistance, except for assistance to children and infants. Will resume propaganda
            broadcasts, though N. Koreans have threatened to attack the broadcast towers.
