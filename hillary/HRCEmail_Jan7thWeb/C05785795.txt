Subject: Report that Fayyad to resign

Ziad Asali (American Task Force for Palestine) said this morning that Salam Fayyad called him to say he was going to
resign in the next day or two. He would not wait for the reconciliation document to be signed, and would not wait to be
fired. The Israeli postponement of the clearance meeting was the last straw. According to Ziad, Salam is trying to figure
out the "how" of his resignation in order to best position himself for the future, in terms of elections there and
credibility with us and with the Israelis. Ziad said Salam wants this close hold for now, but I think S needs to know.

Daniel, you hear anything?
