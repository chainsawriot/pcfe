1. (SBU) In the pre-dawn hours of Sunday morning, March 11, a U.S. soldier allegedly departed his Forward
   Operating Base (FOB) in a village in Panjwai District, Kandahar Province. Precise details about the
   engagement remain unclear, but according to local accounts as reported in the press, the solider shot a
   number of Afghan civilians, resulting in multiple deaths and injuries, including several children. ISAF can
    confirm 13 victims killed and five wounded, though the numbers may change. (Ministry of Defense
   reported 15 killed.) Reports from Afghans on the scene, including Security Coordinator Asidullah Khalid
    and Kandahar Police Chief Raziq, range to up to 20 fatalities. Five wounded civilians, including three
    children, have been transported to Kandahar Airfield (KAF) Role 3 hospital for treatment. One, a 10 year
    old girl, is critical. The solder is in U.S. military custody and has been moved to KAF where he is being
    detained.

2. (SBU) Upon learning of the incident, Charge d'Affaires Ambassador Cunningham and D/COMISAF LTG
   Bradshaw (UK) called on Defense Minister Wardak. (Note: As with the Quran burning, ISAF, IJC and
   RC-S have been working security and political leaders in Kandahar and Kabul). Cunningham and
    Bradshaw expressed ISAF and USG deep regret and condolences for the loss of life and pledged a full
    investigation in cooperation with Afghan authorities. They urged Wardak, who had already received
    reports of 15 deaths, to work to control the reaction. Wardak suggested a call "at the political level" to
    President Karzai might help. Cunningham told Wardak that the attack seemed the work of one disturbed
    individual, who had been detained. Wardak said the attack involved families from two villages, and there
    were rumors that several American solders must have been involved. Cunningham asked Wardak not to
   jump to conclusions. Wardak said his information is that ANA found an American passed out in one of the
    compounds and turned him over to coalition forces.

3. (SBU) The Presidential Palace issued a statement the evening of March 11. Text follows:

    "President Hamid Karzai Condemns the Intentional Killing of Civilians by an American Soldier in Panjwai
    District of Kandahar Province

    Kabul: The President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai condemned with strong terms
    the killing of Afghan civilians in Panjwai District of Kandahar Province and described this action of the
    American Soldier as an intentional conduct and mass murder.



     UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05790520 Date: 01/07/2016
    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05790520 Date: 01/07/2016




   Last night an American soldier broke into the houses of civilians in Panjwai District, yang Aabad and
   Baland-i-pul area, killing 16 civilians, including 9 children, three women and the rest were all men, and
   wounding five other civilians. President Karzai said, "The Government of Afghanistan has repeatedly
   condemned those counter terrorism operations in which civilians are killed. And the American soldier that
   killed civilians is an intentional murderer and assassin. This is an unforgiveable action."

   President Karzai added that the Afghan government and the people of Afghanistan asks the United States
   government for an explanation about this incident. Likewise, President Karzai, when he found out about
   this incident, assigned a delegation comprised of the Minister of Border and Tribal Affairs and President
   Karzai's representative to RC-South, Assadullah Khalid, Kandahar Chief of Police, the Commander of
   ANA Corps for RC-South and members of the Kandahar Provincial Council and Tribal Elders to
   investigate the incident.

   President Karzai also had a telephone conversation with the delegation and a number of tribal elders in
   Kandahar province. During this telephone conversation with President Karzai, a tribal elder named Haji
   Samag Aka, who lost a member of his family : during this incident, told President Karzai, "Despite your
   repeated demand from the United States to prevent civilian casualties, American soldiers still kill innocent
   civilians. American soldiers oppress us and make us suffer as if we are on fire."

   Residents of Kandahar emphasized to President Karzai that they wanted the government of Afghanistan
   to know that "this barbaric action should not be left without answers and the perpetrators should receive
   hard punishment."

   President Karzai assured the people of Kandahar that the Afghan government will seriously raise this
   issue with the Americans and will not be left without answers.

   In addition, President Karzai also talked with those who are wounded in this incident and sent his
   condolence to them. Among the people who were wounded, a young boy named Rafiullah, who is 16
   years old, told President Karzai that American soldiers entered his room while it was dark, waking up
   members of his family and then opened fire at him and his family members.

   Considering the special importance of this incident in which innocent civilians, especially women and
   children, were intentionally murdered, President Karzai assigned a second delegation from Kabul, headed
   by the Afghan Army Chief of Staff, with the Deputy Minister of Interior and the Deputy of the National
   Directorate of Security as members, and tasked the delegation with visiting the area where the incident
   took place to conduct further investigation and report back to the President's office as soon as possible."
   End text.

4. (SBU) The Ministry of Defense also issued a statement the evening of March 11. Text follows: "The
   Minister of Defense and the personnel of MOD are very saddened and stunned hearing the news that 15
    of their countrymen were martyred and nine were wounded, including men, women, elders, and children
    by coalition forces (Note: we are checking to see if that is what the statement actually said) in Zangabad
    village, (Panjwai) Punwai district of Kandahar province. The Ministry strongly condemns this inhuman and
    devastating incident and asks the authorities of ISAF to capture the perpetrators of this merciless action
    as soon as possible and punish them for their despicable crime. The Ministry of Defense conveys its
    condolences and sympathies to the families of the victims, and asks the Almighty Allah to reward the
    victims the best heaven and the soonest recover for the wounded."

5. (SBU) ISAF and the U.S. Embassy have issued statements of condolence, attached, which were quickly
    picked up by international and Afghan media. The Embassy is also providing to Afghan television and
   radio stations digital recordings of Ambassador Cunningham and two other Embassy officers delivering
    those statements in English, Pashto, and Dan. At 1500 the Embassy held an Emergency Action
    Committee to review our security posture; outcomes of that EAC meeting are being reported by septel.

6. (SBU) According to RC-South, as reported to post as of mid-afternoon March 11, DST Panjwai reports no
   change in the situation there. Approximately 100 protestors remained gathered outside of the district
    center, but there had been no reports of violence. The FOB where the DST is located, which is

   contiguous to the district center, was on lockdown. The incident began to be reported in Kandahar media
   on Twitter at about 1100 local time. There were reports that Kandahar Governor Wesa had released a
   statement on the incident, but KPRT verified that Wesa has not yet done so. Asidullah Khalid reportedly
   has been in contact with Karzai, and in a brief local statement reportedly attempted to calm emotions,
   saying he had been to the scene and one rogue soldier seemed to be involved. Local media outlets were
   issuing conflicting messages regarding the number and severity of casualties. According to PRT
   Kandahar, there were no reports of public reaction to the incident other than the gathering noted above in
   Panjwai district. PRT Uruzgan cancelled outside the wire movements until they could gauge local reaction
   to the incident. PRT Zabul reported no reaction in Zabul Province so far. PRT Zabul discussed the
   incident briefly with the Provincial Chief of Police and other GIRoA officials who attended the PRT's
   Transfer of Authority ceremony this morning, but it appeared to be the first that they had heard of it.

7. (SBU) News of the incident quickly became the lead story for all international and Afghan media. So far,
   Afghan media coverage has been straightforward, with outlets expanding their stories throughout the
    afternoon as more facts became known. This evening's Afghan newscasts, which will air later, will provide
    the first opportunity to gauge reaction, followed by the current events talk shows.

8. (SBU) Comment: Following within a few weeks of the February 20 Quran burning incident and violent
   aftermath, this event may trigger renewed Afghan public anger. End comment.
