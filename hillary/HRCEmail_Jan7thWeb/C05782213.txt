The last part is a little disingenuous, since it won't be the "UN" that makes the decision but the member states working
through the credentials committee. Resolving Gadhafi's fate ahead of UNGA will help make this an easier decision.

What surprises me about this public standoffishness by Brazil is that its companies have big contracts at stake, and these
companies, Odebrecht in particular, brokered the initial contacts between the GOB and the TNC. Also, the GOB has sent
its ambassador in Cairo to Benghazi to meet with the TNC. I will work back through these co mpanies to urge them to
reach out to Patriota.

Hmmm

Brazilian Foreign Minister Patriota said recognition of the Transitional National Council was "not necessary at this stage"
and added the UN would determine the legitimate representative of Libya at the upcoming General Assembly. (Xinhua

LIBYA UPDATE
(U) Brazilian Foreign Minister Patriota said recognition of the Transitional National Council was "not
necessary at this stage" and added the UN would determine the legitimate representative of Libya at the
upcoming General Assembly. (Xinhua News)

TURKEY THREATENS ISRAELI SOLDIERS WITH LEGAL ACTION
(SBU) The Turkish Embassy in Washington claimed Turkey would seek to prosecute Israeli soldiers and
officials responsible for the deaths of nine Turkish activists during the May 2010 flotilla raid, according to
press. Embassy Ankara comments the immediate loss of political, diplomatic, intelligence, and military
cooperation between two close U.S. allies has far more significance than the prospect of international legal
action. (Ops/Embassy Ankara e-mail, Haaretz)

CIS LEADERS TO DISCUSS INTERNATIONAL ISSUES
(SBU) Presidents from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) will also discuss organizational
development during the meeting in Dushanbe, media report. Embassy Moscow comments Russia will use the
summit to deepen economic and political integration in the region, resolve disputes, and further cement its
military presence. Russia views the volatile Central Asian region as both an integral part of its national security
and as a buffer zone between itself and Afghanistan. (Ops/Embassy Moscow e-mail, RM Novosti)

RUSSIAN BILLIONAIRE EXPLORES CANDIDACY FOR 2012 ELECTION
(SBU) Mikhail Prokhorov said he might run for president in March 2012 if his Right Cause Party does well in
the December parliamentary poll, media report. Embassy Moscow notes Prokhorov's party is struggling to find
support and adds even if the Right Cause Party wins representation in parliament, Prokhorov's candidacy would
be an ornamental imitation of political pluralism in an increasingly flawed electoral system. (Ops/Embassy
