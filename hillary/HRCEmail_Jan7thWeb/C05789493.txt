I appreciate your sending thgis to me. Neither State nor my staff had anything



to do w this. The man stood up just as I was starting and GW--which claims their



quick actions were part of their standard operating procedures to remove anyone

remove him. GW claims he was not in any way injured. We have no other info but



I will see what else can be done.

Don't know if you are aware of this unfortunate incident described below on



Larry Johnson's website. Ray McGovern, a former CIA officer who gave the daily



brief for President George H.W. Bush, is pretty well known in the intelligence



community. He's become a Christian antiwar leftist who goes around bearing



witness. Whatever his views, he's harmless. Something bad happened at your



speech at GW. And it's become a minor cause celebre on the Internet among



lefties. You might have someone check this out and also have someone apologize



to Ray McGovern.

* Bumped Up *



During a speech by Hillary earlier this week at George Washington University



retired CIA analyst, Ray McGovern, was physically accosted and arrested for



disorderly conduct for the simple act of standing up and turning his back to



Hillary. Ray ended his career at the CIA as one of the senior officers who



provided George H.W. Bush his daily intelligence brief. Since then Ray has



emerged as an anti-war activist. Ray is a fearless but he also is a kind, gentle

soul.



Here's the video:



Now let's go back and watch what happened when Ray confronted Donald Rumsfeld:



Unfortunately Hillary is getting blamed for what happened to Ray, but it is not



her fault. Hillary is not in charge of her security detail. She does not call



the shots. The thugs who set upon Ray were out of line. He had every right to



stand and silently protest. He posed no threat to Hillary and made no



threatening move. The security folks grossly over-reacted and Ray should have an



excellent law suit against the University and those in charge of the security.



Ray's treatment is part of the Gabby Giffords effect. In the aftermath of the



attack on Giffords it is understandable that security officials feel a



heightened need to be hyper-vigilant. But protective details also need to



exercise common sense and use appropriate force. Since the folks inside the



auditorium had gone thru a metal detector there was no reason to assume that Ray



represented a threat to do harm. And to reitierateâ€”he made no threatening move,



he did not speak out of turn and did not try to approach the stage.



It is the ultimate irony that the Obama Administration is calling on foreign



leaders to tolerate protest and dissent but when it comes to an old man standing

silently there was no tolerance at all.
