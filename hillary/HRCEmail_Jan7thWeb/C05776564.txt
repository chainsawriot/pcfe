Subject:                            Fw: Israeli forest fire kills 40 people (SBU)


Fyi - Selva says 22 dead 25 injured - a bus of prison employees (Israelis) flipped over. Really tragic.

Talked to Matt. No further update on FTA. Coy on Jim trip; said they were playing with Dai trip but "don't tell Jim.". I was
pretty forceful but he didn't give much. Said he'd call back later with more.

Subject: Israeli forest fire kills 40 people (SBU)

(SBU) Many of the deaths occurred on a bus evacuating people from a prison in northern Israel, media report. The Israel
and Palestinian Affairs Office notes the victims were likely guards or Palestinian prisoners. If the victims were
Palestinians, there could be street protests. There are no reports any Americans were affected.
