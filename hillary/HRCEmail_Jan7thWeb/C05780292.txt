  Re: Q's secret bid to UK


 On the morning of June 2, 2011 sensitive sources with access to the advisors to Muammar
 Qaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam, stated in strict confidence that the Libyan government has opened
 extremely complicated negotiations with the government of the United Kingdom (UK) in an
 effort to obtain their support in reaching a ceasefire agreement with the rebels of the Libyan
 Transitional National Council (TNC), allowing the Qaddafi's to maintain some level of control
 in the country.

  This initiative is directed by Saif al-Islam and, according to these sensitive sources, the Libyans
  have asked the UK officials to broker a deal with the TNC that will allow some form of power
  sharing, with the possibility of Saif al-Islam acting as head of state and the TNC members
  making up a substantial portion of the cabinet in a new government. Under the plan Muammar
  Qaddafi would be allowed to leave the country and go into exile with no danger of indictment on
  charges of human rights abuses and corruption by Libyan or international courts.

  (Source Comment: In the opinion of these sensitive sources, this initiative reflects the concern of
  the Qaddafi government that as a result of continuing NATO air raids against their forces, they
  can no longer defeat the rebel army. They add that there has been no firm response from the UK
  government, and the initial discussions have been conducted by officers of the British Special
  Intelligence Service (SIS / MI-6). In the opinion of these same sources the initial idea of these
  talks may have been raised by former Libyan Foreign Minister Mousa Kousa, after his arrival in
  London in late March 2011.)

  According to these sensitive sources, Saif al-Islam and his advisors realize that there is little
  chance the TNC will agree to such an offer, and that SIS may be using this contact as a means of
  collecting intelligence while protecting British interests in Libya. Notwithstanding this concern,
  in the opinion of these individuals, Saif al-Islam believes that introducing the possibility of a
  ceasefire and the subsequent negotiations may create divisions within NATO and weaken their
  military operations against Qaddafi's forces.

    (Source Comment: These sources add that many of Saif al-Islam's advisors do not know if, or to
    what extent, the UK Government has shared knowledge of this initiative with the governments of
    the United States and the other NATO allies.)

    At the same time, sources with access to the operations of the TNC military committee state
    privately that on June 1, 2011 Libyan intelligence officers detonated a car bomb outside the
    Tibesti Hotel in the TNC capital of Benghazi. One person was injured in the blast and a number
    of nearby vehicles were damaged. TNC security officers occupied the hotel and the surrounding
    area immediately after the attack, but were not able to identify any of the attackers. The Tibesti
    Hotel is an important landmark in the heart of Benghazi and is used by the TNC government, as
    well by foreign journalists and diplomats. Hotel security has been heightened in the hours
    following the attack and all foreign residents are under surveillance by TNC security officers,
    looking for suspicious activities and contacts.
