Subject: Burma announcement: Washington outreach results

Kurt:

Results of our post-announcement outreach/engagement here in Washington today. Virtually all "validators," Hill
stakeholders, and Burma watchers are very positive and supportive; a few others merely muted. We have additional
outreach scheduled for Monday (included like-minded Washington missions).

Regards, Patrick and team
