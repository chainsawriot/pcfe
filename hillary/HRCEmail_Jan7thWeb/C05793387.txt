From Beth Jones:

                                                                                                                  B1
Jake and Bill,                                                                                                    1.4(D)
Marc called at 0500EST to report:
+He, Ryan and Frank met for 90 minutes with Stanekzai. They went over every point of apparent contention raised by
GIRoA sources in the WP article They discussed each element of our plan-




+Marc, Ryan and Frank will see Karzai at 5pm for 90 minutes to two hours.
+ They will call     and me again then to provide a read-out and to refine next steps.                                       B5
                                                         See outline of other steps below.                        B1
+ In his speech to Parliament this morning in Kabul, Karzai said nothing that causes the USG any problem. News repot 4(D)
have him announcing his meeting with HIG, which we already know about.

In the meantime, the plan is:
                                                                                                                         1.4(D)
                                                                                                                         B1
                                                                                                                         B5




Please call me through Ops if you have questions or want me to raise any issues with Marc and Ryan in the next call,
which will be around 10am EST Beth
