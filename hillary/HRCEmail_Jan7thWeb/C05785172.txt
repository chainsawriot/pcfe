Subject: Senate Wrap Up

All â€” The Senate concluded legislative business for the year today. They passed a 2 month extension of the payroll tax
cut which also contains the expedited determination procedures for Keystone XL. In addition, the Senate cleared the
Omnibus appropriations bill as well as a 6 day CR to allow time to get the paperwork to the WH for the President's
signature. The Senate also approved an $8.1 billion disaster aid bill but importantly rejected the 1.8% across the board
rescission (except for Defense and Military Construction) that the House had approved to pay for it.

On nominations, thanks to the Secretary's intervention this morning we ultimately got 2 of the 4 nominations the Senate
approved today aside from some military promotion lists. Mike McFaul as Ambassador to Russia and Amb. Joyce Barr as
A/S for Administration were both confirmed by the Senate today.
                      the Republicans objected to a longer list which included all of our pending nominees. In addition,

                                                        Dave
