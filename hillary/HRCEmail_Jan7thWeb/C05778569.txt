We have heard from two credible sources that the GCC Peninsula Shield Force (currently includes
only Saudi elements) is said to be departing King Khalid Military City (northeast Saudi Arabia) along
with the 3rd riot control battalion of the Saudi Arabia National Guard on their way to the causeway to
cross into Bahrain. Dhahran confirmed that the causeway is being shut down, some trucks are
moving across but we do not yet have confirmation of who/what is in trucks.
