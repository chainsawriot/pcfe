      President Barack Obama                                                        May 1, 2011

      Dear President Obama,

      Today is the start of Month 22 of the unjust detention of our sons in Iran. On May 11,
      Shane and Josh will be put trial in one of Iran's revolutionary courts in front of a judge who
      has not hesitated to impose the death sentence on innocent people. Our frustration and
      our anxiety have become unbearable. Our families are devastated and disillusioned. Shane
      and Josh are American citizens but we do not believe that our government is devoting the
      same effort to bringing them home as it has put into helping other Americans in distress.
      We need your leadership and urgent action from your Administration.

      In a call with Secretary Clinton on April 20, we made it very clear how disappointed we are
      that the Administration has not taken more robust measures to end this tragic ordeal. Over
      the course of 21 months, we have asked our government to take the steps needed to secure
      Shane and Josh's freedom. As we told Secretary Clinton, with Shane and Josh about to
      stand trial, we expect you and your Administration to do what it takes to bring our sons
      back to us. Now more than ever, it is time for our government to act and not wait for
      others to act for it.

      Mr. President, we have not had any contact with Shane and Josh for six months, their
      lawyer and Swiss consular officers have been denied access to them and we increasingly
      fear for their safety and welfare. One week from today, we will spend a second
      consecutive Mother's Day without our sons. The extraordinary pain we are all feeling in our
      families must have an end.

      We have heard from your staff that you are personally committed to gaining Shane and
      Josh's freedom. We appreciate those reassurances but we want to see words become
      actions.

      Thank you for your attention to this urgent humanitarian matter.



       Sincerely,


                                                   q. -7724- ix
