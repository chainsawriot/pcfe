Cheryl

The Post Personnel System for USAID in Khartoum shows:

           19 US Direct Hire or US Personal Service Contractors
           33 Locally Engaged Staff desk personnel
           6 Locally Engaged Staff non-desk positions [e.g. guards/gardeners/janitors]

           = 58 total.

A recent Embassy table prepared as part of the periodic "rightsizing" review shows:

           10 US Direct Hire
           11 US Personal Services Contractor
           38 LE Staff desk

           = 59 total.

I can try to get this reconciled and will try
but suspect that these numbers are close enough to answer the question

let me know

regards

pat
