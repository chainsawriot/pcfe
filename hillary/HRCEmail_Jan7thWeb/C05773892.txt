Subject: INR poll: first post-flood results on Pakistani views of US assistance

Judith,
Attached please find INR's first post-flooding data on Pakistani views of the United States. The data in the first
attachment
        I wanted to be certain that you received this information directly from INR.

We are in the process of completing a fuller analysis of the data and hope to have a finished report ready later next
week. If you have questions or would like additional information, please contact me or our lead analyst on Pakistan, Tim
Gembicki.
