   1. Wisner is talking                              at 930 tonight. You're of course welcome to join (I think not
       necessary). I will join.

   2.                                                                                 He will leave around noon or 1.

   3. One non-Egypt issue we need to nail down is this CBM business. Bibi clearly believes that if he does something —
       really anything — on CBMs, he's free and clear of other "U.S. initiatives."



   4. I told the team you will wait til the (still-not-scheduled) MEPP Monday to decide about the Lavrov call.

    5. I will send you top lines and Q&A for the shows tomorrow, all on Egypt. I've worked them through with
         Ben. Others are reviewing. We'll do a call in the morning with the key players.

    6. One thorny issue is the assistance issue.                      does not want to be categorical about us maintaining
        our aid, because of the possibility of the army firing on protestors. He thinks Gibbs' line was, well, not so
        bad.
