Subject:                          Re: the role of women in the Middle East



Thx for the timely message since I've been making the case to the WH that in his speech the POTUS has to stress that
women must be included in all these transitioning political systems. Melanne was concerned by what she learned in her
many mtgs in Egypt this past week. So we are beating every drum we can find! I would welcome any thoughts/text
suggestions you have. And, Happy Easter to you and your family.

Subject: the role of women in the Middle East

I have been monitoring (and broadcasting) a growing number of articles re the important role of women in ME protests.
I gather that POTUS is going to give a big speech on US policy re the Arab Spring; I hope that he can say something about
women more than just in passing. I am happy to send along sources/text if it would be helpful. Happy Easter!
All best,
AM
