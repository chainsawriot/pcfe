         Sid,

         Fyi in preparation for the next crisis, this is just in from a friend on the ground in the country in question. It is by
necessity very general, we can obviously provide increasingly detailed material, but it will require different handling
(translated from French, so it sounds a little awkward)

         take care, t

         February 12 2011 there is to be an unauthorized demonstration in the district of Algiers itself (Government
rejection of a demonstration pass is in the press, as are calls for the demo). This is organized by political/student
opposition as a test of their strength and to verify the reaction of the Government of Algeria. This is a follow on to a
series of demonstrations over the past two weeks in the town kabila of Bejaia district, where the participation was
heavy.

        The demonstration in Algiers is expected imposing, the demonstrators have two demands: revocation of the 20
year old state of emergency, and the resignations of President Bouteflika;

       Also in this case, like in Tunisia and Egypt, at this early stage there seems to be only a limited Islamist
involvement. The movement is focused at this stage on political/economic issues in Algeria That said, officials are
perplexed by the decision of Islamists of to remain aside. They believe these groups will try to take advantage of any
difficulties that develop.
