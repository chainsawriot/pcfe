Subject: congratulations

Let me tell you how proud I felt as I saw, on CNN, Secretary
Clinton in her congressional testimony. What a privilege to see clarity
supported by convincing arguments; confidence buttressed by exquisite
reasoning; and assertiveness sometimes accompanied with warm laughter, hinting she
was perfectly comfortable under pressure that would have overwhelmed even
the most self- confident . And I was proud to see a certain lady in light
blue passing notes proving, yet again, the crucial role she has played in
moving so many agendas forward in days that only had forty eight hours.

I don't have the privilege of knowing what your next steps will be, but I
don't want to miss the opportunity of thanking you for your leadership,
emphasis on keeping focused and encouragement during the hardest of times
in Haiti
