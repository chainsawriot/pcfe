Below please see the report issued by the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda (very credible source). Note on State
Department:

NHLA is extremely disappointed in that only one Hispanic has been appointed among the 15 positions filled at the State
Department to date. NHLA respectfully urges the President and the Secretary of State to appoint additional well
qualified Hispanics during the course of filling the 30 high level positions remaining.

Thoughts -- We have                     coming down the pike for announcement soon, then hopefully           will accept   B6
forP-1That will leave us at 4 - less than 10 percent - of high level state department positions (excluding ambassadors).
I will work with Margaret on identifying what other high level positions there are to rally more candidates for her to
interview for those spots.




Of the Schedule C appointments the report mentions only 2 State candidates -                          Mildred is the       B6
only other one we have brought on board who was not listed. Also a very low number in comparison to other agencies.

NATIONAL LATINO LEADERS REPORT ON

OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S FIRST 100 DAYS

April 29, 2009



     UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. -12014-20439 Doc No. C05761143 Date: 01/07/2016
      UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761143 Date: 01/07/2016




BACKGROUND




Every President of the United States since Lyndon B. Johnson has made some effort to include Hispanics in his
Administration. Hispanics have held top level positions in the administrations of Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon,
Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush.




Ronald Reagan was the first President to appoint Hispanics to cabinet-level positions. He appointed two and every
President since Reagan has had at least one Hispanic serving in a cabinet-level position in their administration whether
they served two, four, or eight years as President. Bill Clinton was the first to have three Hispanics in cabinet-level
positions at the same time when he exercised his prerogative and elevated the office of the Administrator of SBA to
cabinet level. George W. Bush chose not to continue the designation but still had two Hispanics in his cabinet
throughout his two terms.




All Presidents want to fill positions in their administration with the best qualified persons, and that is the way it should
be. No one should expect to be appointed to any position by the President because of their race, gender or national
origin, even though as presidential candidates they promise to do so. More importantly, given massive demographic
change that the country is experiencing, it is no longer possible to craft or implement effective policies and programs
without the experience and expertise provided by a diverse, truly representative government.




Still, Presidents try to accomplish something in the course of appointing the best qualified persons to their
administration. Bill Clinton wanted a government that looked like America and in the process named two Hispanics to
head two major departments in his cabinet, elevated a third to cabinet level, brought an unprecedented number of
Hispanics into his administration, and signed Executive Order 13171, which called for government-wide strategies to
address the persistent under-representation of Latinos within the federal workforce. He was also very much aware of
the fact that Hispanics helped him carry 14 of 16 major electoral vote states in which over 90% of the Hispanic vote was
concentrated.




George W. Bush brought a natural sensitivity and affinity to his administration, having served as Governor of Texas, a
state with the second largest Hispanic population in the nation. He too appointed two Hispanics to his cabinet, chose to
extend Executive Order 13171, and, like Clinton, brought a reasonably high number of Hispanics into his administration.
Similarly, George Bush was very much aware of the fact that Hispanics helped him carry six major electoral vote states in
which 90% of the Hispanic vote was concentrated.




Barack Obama assumed the Presidency promising change, which lends itself more to qualitative measurement than
quantitative. Still, during his first 100 days he nominated three Hispanics to major cabinet-level positions. One nominee
withdrew and the other two were subsequently confirmed by the Senate. It remains to be seen how many Hispanics are
ultimately named to high positions in his administration, and whether he will choose to extend Executive Order 13171.
And, like his last two predecessors, he too is very much aware of the fact that Hispanics helped him carry 14 of 16 major

electoral vote states in which 90% of the Hispanic vote is concentrated, in addition to North Carolina, Virginia, and
Indiana.




On comparing the Clinton, Bush, and Obama Administrations




In order to make a fair comparison as to how Hispanics have fared during the first 100 days of the Clinton, Bush, and
Obama administrations, one should first recognize that the Hispanic community has changed considerably since 1992. In
1992 the estimated Hispanic population was 22.4 million, 5.1 million were registered to vote, approximately 4.2 million
voted, and 61% voted for Clinton. In 2000 the estimated Hispanic population was 33.3 million, 7.5 million were
registered to vote, approximately 5.9 million voted, and 35% voted for Bush. In 2008 the estimated Hispanic population
was 44 million, 14 million were registered to vote, approximately 10 million voted, and 67% voted for Obama. So not
only has the Hispanic population grown exponentially since 1992, the Hispanic electorate has grown dramatically, and in
2008 helped carry traditional states and more importantly proved decisive in carrying non-traditional states.




So from Clinton to Obama the Hispanic population doubled, voter registration nearly tripled, and voter turnout more
than doubled. Obama received more Hispanic votes than the combined total number of votes cast in 1992 and 2000.
He received 4.1 million more Hispanics votes than Clinton in 1992 and 4.6 million more Hispanic votes than Bush in
2000. The November 2008 election created a new political reality — a new political reality that has emboldened the
Latino community and Latino leaders to demand the change President Obama promised and to expect more than we got
from both Clinton and Bush. Clinton and Bush did not give Hispanics something to strive for. They gave us something to
surpass. Anything less is not change, but more of the same or worse.




President Obama's first 100 days




President Obama is to be commended on the appointments of Hispanics he has made to date and for the access to the
process that NHLA has had, but NHLA is very disappointed in the overall results. For the record, the Transition Team and
NHLA leaders worked very closely from the beginning to find and encourage well qualified Hispanics to apply. Once the
President was sworn into office NHLA continued working with the White House Office of Presidential Personnel to
ensure that more Hispanics would be nominated and appointed and that more prospective candidates would continue
to apply. NHLA commends the President for the access we have had and the transparency with which the process has
been conducted, but the results speak for themselves. These efforts fell well short of the target. Latinos remain one of
the most under-represented groups in government and the most under-represented at the Senior Executive Service
level.




We are also mindful of the fact that senior White House appointees and the Office of Presidential Personnel have been
similarly accessible to other Hispanic groups on matters pertaining to personnel as well as policies, and the President is
to be commended for that as well. But regardless of the group with which the Administration has worked, the results
have fallen below target and Latinos remain seriously under-represented.

As of April 27, has announced 58 Hispanics who have been nominated or appointed to positions in the Obama
administration, including 19 that require Senate confirmation.




The Cabinet. NHLA commends the President for nominating two highly qualified Hispanics to major cabinet level
positions — Hilda Solis at Labor and Ken Salazar at Interior. Both departments are extremely important, given the nature,
scope, and purview of their responsibilities.




And while NHLA also commends the President for nominating a third Hispanic, Governor Bill Richardson, to a major
cabinet level position (Commerce), NHLA is extremely disappointed in that another Hispanic was not nominated from
the impressive list of well qualified and experienced Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, and Cubans that NHLA provided when
Governor Richardson withdrew, considering that no Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, Cubans, or Central and South Americans
had been nominated for anything at the time.




The White House. NHLA commends the President for appointing four highly qualified Hispanics to senior staff level
positions in the White House — Cecilia Munoz, Louis Caldera, Adolfo Carrion, Jr., and Moises Vela, Jr.




But NHLA is extremely disappointed in that only four Hispanics are among the 49 Presidential appointees selected to
date to fill senior staff positions in the White House and that no Cubans or Dominicans have been included.




And while NHLA commends the President for appointing five highly qualified Hispanics to the position of Special
Assistant to the President including Alejandro Perez at Legislative Affairs, Michael Camunez at Presidential Personnel,
and Roberto Rodriguez, Carlos Monje, and Tino Cuellar at the Domestic Policy Council, NHLA is extremely disappointed
in that not one Hispanic has been appointed Assistant to the President or senior advisor, the President's inner circle.
NHLA is also disappointed in that not one of the five Special Assistants is Puerto Rican, Cuban, or Dominican.




The Sub-Cabinet. NHLA also commends the President for nominating 17 highly qualified Hispanics to Senate-
confirmation required sub-cabinet level positions at various departments —

NHLA is extremely disappointed in both the number of Hispanics appointed to date and that not one single Hispanic has
been nominated for a position that requires Senate-confirmation at four major departments including Interior, Health
and Human Services, Treasury, and Defense.




High Level Staff Positions. Though Hispanics are severely under-represented at this level as well, NHLA commends the
President for appointing 27 well qualified Hispanics to other high level positions throughout his Administration including
the White House (17), Transportation, Labor, Homeland Security, State, Office Personnel Management, Peace Corps,
and U.S. Trade Representative (3). They are:

Department of Veteran's Affairs to date. NHLA respectfully urges the President and the Secretary of Veteran's Affairs to
appoint additional well qualified Hispanics during the course of filling the eight high level positions remaining to be
filled.




Three of these 16 major departments have no Hispanics in Senate confirmation required positions — Defense, Health and
Human Services, and Treasury. A combined total of 143 high level positions in these 16 departments have been filled to
date and only 18 by Hispanics. Ten departments have only one Hispanic in a high-ranking position; one department has
two Hispanics; and two departments (HUD and Labor) have three Latinos.

Hispanic appointments.

No position has been filled. There are no known positions to be filled.

No Hispanics have been appointed by the President to any of these 45 Independent Agencies. Eight of 83 positions have
been filled to date, none by a Hispanic. There are 75 positions yet to be filled, which provide an excellent opportunity
for qualified Hispanics to be appointed and for the Obama Administration to improve on its record.




Conclusion. While NHLA commends the President for his commitment to change, there is none to be seen with regard to
personnel. Hispanics are under-represented at the sub-cabinet and senior staff levels, and on the White House staff. Of
the countless number of positions filled to date by the Administration, including senior advisors, Cabinet, sub-cabinet,
White House staff, and senior staff in major departments, only 58 have been filled by Hispanics. This is not change. This
is more of the same, below target. More announcements of Latinos being nominated for Senate confirmation required
positions are expected in the coming days, weeks and months, which will undoubtedly improve what has been
accomplished during the President's first 100 days.




NHLA would respectfully suggest to the President that he impress upon his Cabinet Secretaries, senior White House staff
and the Office of White House Personnel, and the Office of Personnel Management that they need to be more attentive
to the serious under-representation of Hispanics in the Obama Administration. NHLA respectfully urges the President to
order an agency-by-agency review of the hiring process being utilized and request a "Plan for Change and Improvement"
from each department as it pertains to appointing more Latinos for high level positions, and urge him to call for a
comprehensive report on Hispanic employment in 90 days.




The 16 departments surveyed in this report have a combined total of 205 vacancies which would be the logical place to
start implementing a "Plan for Change and Improvement" and increasing the number of high-ranking Hispanics in the
Obama Administration including Senior Executive Service level positions.




The all but total lack of Hispanic appointments to councils in the Executive Office of the President, as well as to
Regulatory Agencies and Independent Agencies, is a great source of disappointment to NHLA and leaves very much
room for improvement. NHLA respectfully urges the President to order a thorough review of all applications submitted
to identify qualified Hispanic candidates for possible appointment to boards, commissions, and agencies, and to request
more applications if necessary.

     UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761143 Date: 01/07/2016




NHLA remains committed to working with the President, the Office of Presidential Personnel, and all departments to
assist in identifying qualified Hispanics to serve in the Obama Administration, but realizes that the direction and
enforcement must come from the President.




Finally, we commend the President for the aggressive steps he has taken to address tough issues of public policy that,
while affecting all Americans, have disproportionately had an adverse affect on the Latino community, i.e., mortgage
foreclosures, unemployment, education, health (SCHIP), small businesses and immigration reform. NHLA also looks
forward to working with the President and his Administration on specific proposals that affect all Americans and the
Hispanic community particularly, pertaining to education, civil rights, immigration, economic empowerment, health, and
governmental accountability.




NHLA reaffirms its unqualified commitment to continue working with the President and those in his Administration to
help get America back on the right track and moving again.
