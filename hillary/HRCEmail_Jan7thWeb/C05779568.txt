You're not expected to go, as noted in email. This will be senior officials, only a few ministers.

I don't know how they do it the 13th since I'm supposed to have breakfast w Amir that morning in DC after the dinner on
the 12th                                         Could we try to move to the 16th and I could go on my way to Japan?       B5
I'm copying Huma.

Subject: Brits and Libya

Talked to                  this am:

-- Cameron talked to Qatari Amir this morning, and they agreed on Apr 13 in Doha for CG meeting.           said Brits
liked our suggestions on participation, and will invite Greeks. Will do more work on TOR. Understand S will not attend,
aiming for senior officials level (although Hague and HBJ will be there).

          agreed that we need to focus urgently on structure for humanit aid/corridors to Benghazi, etc. As discussed in
London, UN should play overall coordinating role, with NATO (esp Turkey), EU and Qatar/UAE all contributing. Will
follow up with Susan, and UK will also work in NY.

-- Nothing much new from Kusa. Brits handling carefully, v mindful of importance of making him magnet for others.
        said Saif's guy was "unimpressive" in London, still angling for role for Saif and "symbolic" place for dad.
