(Source Comment: In a private conversation during the evening of February 26, Libyan
Minister of Foreign Affairs Mousa Kousa stated that Muammar Qaddafi is moving his
living quarters on a daily basis, primarily between secure Air Force and External Security
Organization (ESO) facilities in the Tripoli region. Qaddafi is convinced that he is under
threat of attack from Western military forces (particularly NATO), as well as disloyal
members of his regime. Accordingly, he is seeking council from a shrinking circle of
advisors, including Mousa Kousa, his sons Mo'ntasem, and Saif al-Islam, as well as loyal
officers from the Air Force, Presidential Guard, and the ESO. Qaddfi believes that, in the

vent of a collapse of security situation in Tripoli, he can always retreat to the town of
;irte, which is controlled by his Qadhafah tribe.)
)uring the morning of February 26 a former official of the Libyan Government stated in
:onfidence that Muammar Qaddafi was visibly shaken when informed by security officials that
he large Magariha tribe, based around the southern city of Sabah, could no longer be counted
al to support him. Many of the leaders of the Armed forces and the Intelligence services come
rom the Magariha, and Qaddafi has favored this tribe since coming to power in
969. According to these individuals, Qaddafi began receiving reports on 19 February that the
v1agariha were turning against the government, but he believed that they would support him
vhen faced with a full scale uprising in the eastern part of the country. (Source Comment: The
eaders of the Magariha were angered when Qaddafi allowed tribal member Abdelbaset Ali al-
vIegrahi to take the blame for the Lockerbie bombing in an international tribunal in 2001. The
Abyan leader believed that he had resolved this situation when al-Megrahi was released from
aison in Scotland and returned to a hero's welcome in Libya in 2009.)
?addafi was particularly angry when Minister of Foreign Affairs Mousa Kousa also warned
hat Abdessalem Jalloud, his lifelong friend, former Prime Minister, and senior member of the
vIaganha, is believed to be giving encouragement to the anti-government forces in the western
art of the country, and in parts of Tripoli. Jalloud is in ill health and has kept a low profile in
ecent years, but he is one of the original young officers who supported Qaddafi in the 1969
ocoup d'etat against King Idriss al-Sanusi.
(Source Comet: Jalloud and Qaddafi are childhood friends and attended the Royal Military
k.cademy together in the mid-1960s. Following the coup, Jalloud was Qaddafi's most powerful
Ldvisor from 1969 to 1993. While the two have not been close since Qaddafi relieved Jalloud
Ls Prime Minister in 1993, the idea that one of his few lifelong friends has turned against him
.eems to his advisors to have shaken Qaddafi. He did not indicate what action. he planned to
ake against Jalloud, if he can get to him.)
While the Magariha situation was difficult for Qaddafi to hear, Mousa Kousa and his other
ecurity advisors were more concerned when three tribes important to the protection of the oil
ields in the Wahat region south of Benghazi went over to the opposition on February 25: the al-

basis. These tribes have now announced that they will protect the oil fields if forces loyal to
 addatsi attack the facilities there, in an effort to carry out his threat to cut off oil to the West, if
us regime begins to falter.
  the revolution in Libya spreads into Tripoli, tribal leaders, former members of the regime,
tudents and academics, have begun organizing into new political structures in the areas held by
pposition forces. Former Minister of Justice Mustafa Abdel Gall, and tribal leaders from the
:astern part of the country met in the town of Al Bayda to begin the process of forming an
nterim government. At the same time, individuals with access to these new political leaders
tate that some of the student and academic leaders are skeptical of the motives of Gall and
yther former members of Qaddafi's government. One Libyan academic told a member of the
vloslem Brotherhood in Egypt that Gall and others are trying to avoid responsibility for past
Times, while taking advantage of the chaos in the country to gain power.
'his individual added that opposition forces in Benghazi have been carefully watching the
ictivities of former Minister of Interior, General Abdul Fatah Younis al Abidi, and have placed
dm under guard. At present he is not being allowed to have outside contact. Opposition
eaders know that Younis can be valuable in the struggle against Qaddafi, but they also feel that
der 40 years as a senior Army officer and Minister of Interior, he may have to answer for the
ictivities of the old regime. (Source Comment: Younis is under house arrest in Benghazi, and
io decision has been made by the various opposition leaders on whether or not to enlist him in
upport of the leadership of the opposition, as a new government starts to take shape.)
