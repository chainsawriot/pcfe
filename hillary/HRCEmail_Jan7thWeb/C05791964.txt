FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 27, 2012

      Readout of the President's Briefing on Preparations for Tropical Storm Isaac and Call with
                       Governors Bentley, Jindal, Bryant and Mayor Landrieu

This afternoon, President Obama was briefed by FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate and National
Hurricane Center Director Dr. Rick Knabb on the preparations underway for Tropical Storm Isaac,
which the National Hurricane Center has projected could become a Category One hurricane later
today. During the briefing, Administrator Fugate provided the President with an update on the
resources FEMA has prepositioned along the Gulf Coast to support state and local officials as they
prepare and begin to respond. Working with DOD, FEMA has set up Incident Support Bases in
Jacksonville, FL and Montgomery, AL to proactively stage supplies closer to areas potentially
affected by the severe weather. Additionally, FEMA has deployed response teams to Alabama,
Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi to support state and local officials and to work to make sure there
are no unmet needs. The President directed Administrator Fugate to ensure that FEMA was prepared
regardless of the ultimate strength and impact of the storm.

Following the briefing, the President convened a call with Alabama Governor Robert Bentley,
Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant, and New Orleans Mayor Mitch
Landrieu. On the call, the President asked Dr. Knabb and Administrator Fugate to provide the
Governors and Mayor an update on the storm's track as well as on the resources FEMA has to
support their teams. The President made clear that he has directed Administrator Fugate to make
sure the Governors have the resources they need as the storm approaches, and asked each Governor
to identify additional needs if they arise.

On the call, the President also informed Governor Jindal that he had approved the Governor's
request for an Emergency Declaration for Louisiana ahead of Tropical Storm Isaac. The declaration
builds on resources already deployed by FEMA and makes Federal funding available for certain
emergency activities undertaken by the state to prepare for and respond to the storm.
