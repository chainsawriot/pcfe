Subject: Report that Fayyad to resign

Ziad Asali (American Task Force for Palestine) said this morning that Salam Fayyad called him to say he was going to
resign in the next day or two. He would not wait for the reconciliation document to be signed, and would not wait to be
fired. The Israeli postponement of the clearance meeting was the last straw. According to Ziad, Salam is trying to figure
out the "how" of his resignation in order to best position himself for the future, in terms of elections there and
credibility with us and with the Israelis. Ziad said Salam wants this close hold for now, but I think S needs to know.

Daniel, you hear anything?

4:30 pm
The President and the Vice President meet with Secretary of Defense Panetta
Oval Office
Closed Press

 Look ahead:
 Wednesday: Twitter town hall
 The audience for tomorrow's hour-long TWITTER TOWN HALL in the East Room (2 p.m. ET) will consist of 140 characters
 -- in a nod to the maximum length of a tweet. President Obama, however, will face no such limit: He'll answer questions
 for the audience, and @TownHall will carry summaries of what he says. Twitter co-founder and Executive Chairman Jack
 Dorsey will ask the questions. Three screens will be behind Obama and Dorsey: one with the current question; another
 will have a heat map of the U.S., showing where the town-hall tweets are concentrated; and the third will show the
 volume of tweets, by topic (jobs, taxes, spending, health care, etc.) Mass Relevance, a company that has worked with
 the broadcast networks on real-time Twitter data, will supply the analytics. Later, Radian6 will study the demographics
 of participants.

 Representative questions will be chosen partly on how often they're retweeted. The White House has also reached out
 to about 10 Twitter leaders in different parts of the country to help surface questions by curating themes and topics that
 are big among their followers and in their communities. So Dorsey may say: "We're hearing a lot about the extension of
 unemployment benefits, especially from the upper Midwest, and here's a question from Bob in Chicago." The audience
 will include 20 people from around the country chosen through the White House Tweetups page, and they'll also get to
 meet with Dorsey and with U.S. Chief Technology Officer Aneesh Chopra and perhaps other policy officials. [Playbook]
