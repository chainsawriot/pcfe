 I have asked both WH and Jeff's team to come up with a list of "significant" things we could announce Monday.

 Will work with L on the recognition issue. They have previously said that all options are open and it's a policy call.

Amb. Cretz - I just spoke with Mr. Jibril. He felt very strongly that there should be a "long" conversation between
yourself (or Sandra) and him to clarify what is to be discussed at the meeting before he commits to flying to Paris. He
said that if mutually useful agenda items were agreed upon, he would come to Paris to meet with us anytime on
Monday. But he said he would not fly to Paris if he perceived this was just a "PR event" for us. How would you like us
to proceed?

Mahmoud Jibril's cell phone number 15                     He is the individual the Secretary will meet with in Paris. I
don't know when he will arrive in Paris-I would guess Saturday or Sunday, maybe even Monday morning. I will try to get
you another contact as well.
