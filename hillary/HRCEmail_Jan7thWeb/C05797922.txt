Subject: POTUS on Leno

Q Let me ask you about Hillary Clinton now. Hillary has said she is stepping down after this election. Have you tried to
get her -- is there any incentive? Because she's done a wonderful job.

THE PRESIDENT: She's done an incredible job. (Applause.)

Q What would it take to get her to stay?

THE PRESIDENT: She has logged a lot of miles and she has been working so hard -- I think it's hard to appreciate the
number of international challenges that have come up in this four-year stretch. Just what happened in the Middle East
alone, typically, is something that might have taken place over the course of 10 years, not a year or two.

And so she's done a great job. I would love for her to stay. I think that she's -- despite my begging, I suspect that it's
time for her to spend a little more time with her family. But she's an incredible talent. She has been a great partner. I
could not be prouder of the work that she's done. (Applause.)
