Subject: My departure in early December

Hi Cheryl and Hurna,

I am planning to conclude my tenure                                in early December. My replacement is
              He is also from INR.
He has been my backup at times this past year, so the Secretary knows him.

My last day could be Friday, December 7.

I intend to raise this with the Secretary when she returns to Washington next week, but I wanted to alert you first.

Cheers,
