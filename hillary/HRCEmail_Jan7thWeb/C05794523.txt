Subject: Tunisian FM Abdessalem

Called for you. He is available tonight or tomorrow, but he is +6 hours ahead of you.

NEA does not have anything new beyond what you have already discussed with the Tunisians so we can forward the
President's/PM's call sheet to you to use for the FM call.

Please let us know if you'd like to speak with him tonight or tomorrow.
