Subject: Internet freedom agenda

All- Negotiations concluded Friday on the revised OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Of note to this group
they include a new provision proposed by the U.S., working closely with Sweden (thank you Alec Ross!), encouraging
cooperative efforts among MNEs, in the appropriate fora, to promote Internet freedom, including freedom of
expression. The Guidelines, last revised in 2000, are the most comprehensive international instrument for corporate
responsibility agreed to by governments. Revisions include a new chapter on human rights and another on supply
chains. They will be signed at the OECD Ministerial chaired by Secretary Clinton in a few weeks.

Let me know if you have any questions, Karen
