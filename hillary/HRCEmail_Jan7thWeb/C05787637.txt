Hillary,

I agree with you that we had to respond, particularly, after the Arab League asked for our intervention.

 The NFZ mission, in a sense, misrepresents what we are actually doing. Yes, we established a NFZ by destroying Q's air
defenses and air forces. But Q's decisive force are his ground forces, particularly, his 2 armor brigades. As such, this
should be our focus and 1973, as you know, provides the authority to do just that when it states "use all measures"....
"to protect the population". We should not limit our military task to just Q's committed forces(those who are engaging
the rebels or the population) but his entire military capability. It is his "Army" that is doing the killing and we should
take down the full capability(command and control, uncommitted forces, even those in garrison, logistical infrastructure
etc). We don't just destroy the "point" of the spear but the whole spear.

Another issue lies with Q's committed forces:

--- Those forces that are outside cities and are not engaging rebels are easy to destroy in the open terrain because ID is
simplified.

--- However, those committed forces that are engaging the people or the rebels present a challenge because of their
proximity to "friendlies" and the danger of friendly fire casualties. This is a challenge we deal with routinely. We call the
mission, close air support(CAS). It features specially trained pilots, unique munitions and an air/ground support team
(JTACS). The air/ground team are positioned with the ground force in this case the "rebels" to facilitate communication
with the CAS aircraft so they can deliver their ordnance accurately on the target. Sometimes, just providing grid
coordinates directly to the aircraft digitally or using lasers to identify the target or in some cases using lasers to guide the
bombs are some of the techniques used. You may recall we did this very successfully in AFG in 2001 when our SF teams
were on the ground with the Northern Alliance and devastated the Taliban ground forces. We use CAS everyday in AFG
to facilitate our ground operations as we did in Iraq.

While the US has the most extensive JTACS capability, our coalition partners also have it. Putting these teams on the
ground from either the US, the coalition or both are essential for successful air operations in proximity to "friendlies". If
we do not provide this capability Q's ground forces will advantage themselves by staying close to the population and,
tragically, continuing to kill them at will.

Sorry for "101" lecture on air/ground ops but want you to understand.

Additionally, if we destroy Q's military capability, other than his personal security forces, it is where his primary strength
is derived. As such, there will be a major erosion of support for him by his inner circle and enhance a possible deal to
remove him or it permits the rebels to return to Tripoli unimpeded by Q's Army and force Q's removal.

If you want to chat, am not on travel.
Wish you well dear friend.

All the best, Jack
