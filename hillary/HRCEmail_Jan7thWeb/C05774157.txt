Heather,
I appreciate your and the Secretary's consideration in this matter, but I think that I will pass on it. I'm sure that Hillary
has people on the east coast who might be better equipped to attend meetings and whose appointment might serve a
needed purpose for her. Thanks for thinking of me. And please thank her for her recent letter regarding my course on
Sports Diplomacy. I was pleased to hear of her new initiatives led by Ann in that area. Will HRC get a chance to attend
the London Olympics?
I hope that your summer is going well.
Regards,
Derek
