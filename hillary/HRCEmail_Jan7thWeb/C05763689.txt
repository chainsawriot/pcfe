JOAN DONOGHUE ASKED THAT I TRANSMIT THIS MESSAGE ON HER BEHALF:

Dear Cheryl, Jake, and Joe:

Welcome back. I have additional information concerning the recent public disclosure by HMG of notes of conversations
between Secretary Clinton and Foreign Secretary Miliband. The disclosure was made in filings with a UK court in the
Binyam Mohamed litigation.
