Subject: Pakistan denies spy agency liked to Afghan killing (AP)

 ISLAMABAD (AP) - Pakistan has denied the Afghan government's claim that the country's spy agency was
involved in the assassination of Afghanistan's envoy for Taliban peace talks.
   Pakistan's Foreign Ministry called the allegation baseless and irresponsible in a statement issued Sunday. It
called the envoy, former President Burhanuddin Rabbani, Pakistan's friend.
   Afghan Interior Minister Bismullah Khan Mohammadi claimed in parliament Saturday that Pakistan's Inter-
Services Intelligence agency was involved in the suicide bombing that killed Rabbani. The government said it
had given Pakistan evidence.
   The Pakistani statement said the evidence consisted of the confession of an Afghan national, Hamidullah
Akundzadeh, accused of masterminding the Rabbani's killing.
