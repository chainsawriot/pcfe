Subject: Powell briefing

Ellen,

General Cartwright, Rose, Ted Warner, Tony Blinken, and Brian McKeon met with former Secretary Powell yesterday to
brief him on New START and the conversation went well. Powell did not indicate plans to make his support for New
START public, but he did say he was supportive and he expressed a desire to counter the big concerns (MD preamble,
Bombers, and verification).

Powell spent the first 10 minutes discussing DADT repeal/replace implications with Cartwright.

He began the session by saying he was and always has been a fan of arms control and discussed his current role/support
with Schlesinger, Nunn, Perry etc on the path to zero.

He then asked a series of questions:
- Missile Defense and the preamble
- Why the Bomber counting rule change
- Why not a range (ie: 1700-2200) vs a hard number
- If asked about tactical nukes. ..why didn't we try to cover it in this treaty
- Asked about the negotiation details on telemetry/verification, "Did we lose anything?"

In addition, at the end he asked about the decision to release actual stockpile numbers, Powell is a fan of a bit of
ambiguity. He and the VCJCS briefly discussed China (simplified version: Cartwright expressed his concern/China as a
threat, Powell sees China in a slow build mode with lots of obstacles to overcome).

Simon
