Heads up that Eric Schmitt says NYT will run a story as early as tomorrow indicating that USG has "sigint" that ISI ordered
Saleem Shehzad's murder -- not killing him "accidently" as a number of people have suggested -- and that the order
came from a high level within Nand that the USG is aware and trying to figure out how to respond to the information.
Eric told me he has been briefed on the classified report by someone who has access to it.

I discussed this with INR last week and need to follow up with them. Some of you may already have seen something
about this.

We'll need to tee up press guidance when the story runs. While we won't comment on intel, we can certainly say we are
"very concerned" about threats to journalists in Pakistan, take them seriously, and have discussed Saleem's case in
particular at high levels of the GOP. Then perhaps we should discuss what other steps we might need to take.
