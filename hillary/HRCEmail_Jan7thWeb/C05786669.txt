We should try to force a vote at OAS and push the Brazilians. Should we also have someone call Chavez to express

FM Obeidi has reached out to Bill, who is letting him stew.

Khalil has met the woman in Tunis. He also met with our PRM officer who will be working this. Will keep you posted.

General exasperation in Honduras about how the Brazilians are responding - moving the goalposts, etc. We are
adjusting your call sheet for Santos and then looking for a time Monday (I know it's a crazy day).
