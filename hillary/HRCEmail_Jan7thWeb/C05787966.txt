 FYI

 SOURCE: Sources with access to the highest levels of the Muslim
 Brotherhood in Egypt, The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, and
 Western Intelligence and security services.
         1. According to an individual with access to highest levels of the
 Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood (MB), speaking in strict secrecy, as of early
 February 2012 Supreme Guide Mohamed Badie and the leadership of the MB
 were pleased with the attention given to Egypt during the World Economic
 Forum in Davos, Switzerland. These senior Brothers are convinced that the
 leaders of the Western nations accept the MB as the new, dominant force in
 Egypt and are adjusting their foreign and economic policies accordingly.
         2. At the same time, Bathe discussed this matter at length with the
 leaders of the MB's political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP), Saad
 Al-Katany, speaker of the new lower house of Parliament, and Mohamed
 Mursi. In these conversations Badie warned that the MB and the FJP must
 now strike a balance between these Western interests and their rank and file
 supporters and allies, who expect the new government of Egypt to move
 toward a more traditional Islamic state. In the end, Badie and his advisors
 agreed that, as matters progress, those Western governments, firms, and
 banks that demonstrate a sense of creative flexibility in dealing with the
 civilian government of Egypt will prosper under the new regime. Bathe was
 particularly pleased that while the question of Egyptianâ€”Israeli relations came
  up in recent discussions with Western business and diplomatic leaders, the
  most important individuals appeared to realize that relations between Egypt
  and Israel will change dramatically, and while Egypt does not want a military
  confrontation with Israel they will no longer view them as a partner in the
  region.
         3. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, Badie
  was pleasantly surprised that the visit to Davos of Presidential candidate
  Abdoul Moniem Aboul Fotouh served to improve the reputation of the MB
  among western government and business leaders. Fotouh, a former member
  of ruling council of the MB, left the Brotherhood to run for president after
  Badie and the senior brothers decided that the FJP and other MB supported
  groups would focus on gaining control of Parliament. Badie did note that
  Fotouh is a long-shot to win the presidency, with MB polling indicating that
  Amr Moussa appears to be headed for victory in the elections later this
  year. This turn of events is acceptable to the MB leadership, since Moussa was
  a member of the Brotherhood when he was at University, and the FJP/Salafist
  al Nour party coalition will draft a constitution that centers national power
  with the Parliament.)
          4. The MB leaders are also pleased with the results of discussions with
  the United States Government, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
  both of which, in the analysis of the MB leaders, appear to accept the idea of
  Egypt as an Islamic state. They are also encouraged by the planned arrival of
  delegations of U.S. business leaders scheduled to arrive in Cairo in February
  and March 2012. Badie views these visits as an opportunity to reassure the

 Western leaders that Egypt will be a responsible partner in business and
 diplomatic affairs, while demonstrating to the average Egyptian that the new
 government will deal with these Western powers on equal terms.
        5. (Source Comment: According to a very sensitive source, a
 particularly senior Brother warned Badie that in any discussions with
 Westerner leaders, MB representatives must not mistake polite, diplomatic
 language for firm commitments on important issues. This individual stated
 that such a turn of events will only lead to confusion, and in the end
 undermine their efforts. They must press their Western interlocutors for clear
 explanations of any matters discussed, particularly regarding relations with
 Israel. This individual also warned that delegations arriving before the
 election process is complete in the fall of 2012 will be dealing with both the
 MB/FJP controlled parliament, and an interim government under the
 Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), under acting head of state Field
 Marshall Mohammed Hussein Tantawi. This individual did note that if the
 MB handles this process in an effective manner it will not only help the
 Egyptian economy, but also discourage any inclination the SCAF may have to
 interfere in the process. As the U.S. and the other Western powers engage
 with the MB, it will be more difficult for the military to take action against
 them in the event of a disagreement as the establishment of the new civilian
 government moves forward throughout 2012.)
