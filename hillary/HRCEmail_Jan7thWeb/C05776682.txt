Without the benefit of seeing the clips yet, I think last night worked well. Pitch perfect, positive in that you wrapped
yourself in the wonderful event.

I actually think there was more interest in whether the Imam was there - as evidence of how much voltage the Mosque
issue still carries. Geoff Earle of the NY Post was there for that reason alone. It's early but my read of the NY Post seems
that their cover is dedicated to KSM losing 40 lbs.

In terms of today, I'd say that any question you get on the mosque or the burning, you treat the same and repeat what
you said last night at the Iftar, and go up and out by taking your answer to a place where you are talking about
tolerance, the importance of the world looking at us differently but also as potus said in Cairo that we must see the
world differently. The two way street part. In a way, the burning helps you answer questions about the Mosque - which
remains my fear. I also think you can talk about how proud you were of NYers as their Senator in the wake of 9/11, how
they differentiated between people of a different belief and the terrorists that perpetrated the crime

If you have to get bogged down in one of the events, make it the burning.

But on the Mosque, I would not say anything beyond the President has addressed this issue, "But let me answer you
more generally in terms of tolerance"

I just firmly believe that the Mosque remains a real problem for the WH and that unless you can give a full throated
support of POTUS, you need to stay clear. For a hundred reasons. Not the least of which is that you'll step on your own
speech. And because you'll be kicking the President when he's down. Waay down. There will be a day you need to
publicly disagree with him, but that day is not Wed, Sep 8, 2010 and that issue is not the mosque.

My hope is that by the end of today, people are saying a few things:

• POTUS should have handled his Iftar the way she handled hers

• The speech was soaring in its positivity and big picture look at the world (both things you are often accused of not
doing)

• The speech was the best foot forward anyone in the admin has put forward, and that this side of the ledger is going
well for the Admin, and you are doing exactly what you were hired to do and they are LUCKY to have you given what the
domestic side looks like.

Basically, I think you get the last laugh without being explicit in doing so.

How do you think my remarks went last night? What's your suggestion for my response to any and all questions about
all issues this am?
