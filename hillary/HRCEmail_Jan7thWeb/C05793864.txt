 said, al-Sissi assured Morsi that MI officers were meeting secretly with their Israeli
 counterparts and the meetings remained professional in tone. In this regard the
 IDF commanders agreed with Morsi's plan to send Egyptian Prime Minister
 Hesham Qandil to Gaza on November 16 in an effort to stop the pattern of
 retaliation, at least while he is on the scene. Al-Sissi added that he is not certain
 that the IDF officers coordinated this discussion with the office of Prime Minister
 Benjamin Netanyahu; it was clear to him that the IDF was looking for a way to
 stop the Hamas rocket attacks, which had now reached Tel Aviv, even if only for a
 few days.


        2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of al-Sissi the IDF intelligence
 officeis believe that the situation is precarious for all involved. Their concern is
 that the most senior officers in the IDF believe that Hamas has lost its fear of the
 Israeli Army. Accordingly, these Israeli generals, working with Israeli Minister of
 Defense Ehud Barak, may be inclined to move against radicals in Gaza in the
 immediate future. At the same time, internal political pressures in Israel may lead
 Netanyahu to press for aggressive action in Gaza. Al-Sissi speculated that the
 Israeli decision to attack and kill Hamas leader Ahmed al-Jabari, may be related to
 his role in organizing the kidnapping of Israeli soldier Gilam Shalit, which is still
 an important, emotional political issue in Israel. For his part, Morsi agrees with al-
 Sissi that even if IDF forces enter Gaza in force Egypt cannot be drawn into direct
 conflict with the Israelis. The President also cited MI reports that Israel's "Iron
 Dome" anti-missile system is apparently very effective in operations against the
 Hamas rockets, which should reduce the casualties in Israeli cities, and, perhaps,
 may reduce the pressure on the IDF to move into Gaza in force.)

        3. According to this individual, Morsi is frustrated with the leadership of
Hamas, which has resisted his secret efforts to prevent or moderate their plans to
 attack Israel. Morsi recognizes Hamas' anger after the death of al-Jabari, but notes
 that this moVe and }lamas' calls for help from the new regimes of the Arab Spring
 puts his new Islamist Government under pressure inside of Egypt. Morsi noted
 that more radical Islamic leaders in Egypt are now calling for war with Israel and
 even his more traditional political opponents are criticizing his government and the
 new leadership of the Army for not being more forceful during this crisis. Morsi's
 advisors point out that the new governments in Libya and Tunisia will face •the
 same pressure that could threaten their internal stability.


          4. (Source Comment: This knowledgeable individual adds that al-Sissi is
 concerned privately that the situation in Gaza will escalate beyond the capacity of
 any individual or 'government to control. He adds that certain DP liaison officers
 point out in secret that Netanyahu is unoredictable, the Harnas leaders are fanatics,
 and Morsi is a new leader with a precarious hold on his country, which creates a
 dangerotis environment. Al-Sissi has not shared this particular view with the
 Egyptian. President, wishing to avoid undercutting his confidence at this critical
 time.)
