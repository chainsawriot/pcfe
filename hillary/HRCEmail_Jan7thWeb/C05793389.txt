  I'm on the phone right now w. LaHood. He called                                  I told him Anne was working it. He's         B5
  anxious to get his son out of Egypt. PIs keep me informed.

  Let's see if we can resolve it ourselves today/tomorrow. If not, we will bring in the heavy guns. Tomorrow, we need
  to find out who else is on the list.

  Secretary LaHood may be calling                about his son, Sam, who was prohibited from leaving on his flight              B5
  tonight. Apparently, he is on the exit control list, and there may be others. I think we have a decent chance of
  resolving this tomorrow if we can keep it out of the press. We got hints earlier in the day that there might be
  restrictions on departing the country and had talked to the Foreign Ministry about it.

  Lorne told me that Secretary LaHood had some ideas, and Lorne had urged him to call                                           B5
