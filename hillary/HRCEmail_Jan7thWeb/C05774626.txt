1. That will come from DOD/DOE in a fact sheet, released after you speak.
                                                                                 But I'll check in on it tomorrow to see
if it makes sense for you to provide it.

Two questioris:

Why am I not announcing the stockpile #? Is that coming from DOD? If so, will they have done so before I speak?
