Re: .Morsi reaction to Israel Gaza strikes


SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the governments of Libya and Israel, as well as
the highest levels of European governments and Western Intelligence and security
services.


             1. During the day on November 14, 2012, Egyptian President Mohamad Morsi discussed
the current fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza with his senior Army commander
 General Abdel Fatah al-Sissi and the leadership of the Military Intelligence Service (MI -

Mulchabarat el-Khabeya). According to an extremely sensitive source, Morsi was concerned
that if the situation in Gaza continues escalate Egypt could be drawn into the fighting. He also
expressed frustration with the Hamas Government in Gaza, over which he has been unable to
exert significant influence. Al-Sissi assured the President that while MI has not fixed the
specific underlying cause of the exchange between Hamas and the Israeli Defense Force (IDF)
both sides will continue to retaliate for each attack. That said, al-Sissi assured Morsi that MI
officers were meeting secretly with their Israeli counterparts and the meetings remained
professional in tone. In this regard the IDF commanders agreed with Morsi's plan to send
Egyptian Prime Minister Hesham Qandil to Gaza on November 16 in an effort to stop the
pattern of retaliation, at least while he is on the scene. Al-Sissi added that he is not certain that
the IDF officers coordinated this discussion with the office of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu; it was clear to him that the IDF was looking for a way to stop the Hamas rocket
attacks, which had now reached Tel Aviv, even if only for a few days.




      2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of al-Sissi the IDF intelligence officers believe that
the situation is precarious for all involved. Their concern is that the most senior officers in the
IDF believe that Hamas has lost its fear of the Israeli Army. Accordingly, these Israeli generals,
working with Israeli Minister of Defense Ehud Barak, may be inclined to move against radicals
in Gaza in the immediate future. At the same time, internal political pressures in Israel may
lead Netanyahu to press for aggressive action in Gaza. Al-Sissi speculated that the Israeli
decision to attack and kill Hamas leader Ahmed al-Jabari, may be related to his role in
organizing the kidnapping of Israeli soldier Gilam Shalit, which is still an important, emotional
political issue in Israel. For his part, Morsi agrees with al-Sissi that even if IDF forces enter
Gaza in force Egypt cannot be drawn into direct conflict with the Israelis. The President also
cited MI reports that Israel's "Iron Dome" anti-missile system is apparently very effective in
operations against the Hamas rockets, which should reduce the casualties in Israeli cities, and,
perhaps, may reduce the pressure on the IDF to move into Gaza in force.)

       3. According to this individual, Morsi is frustrated with the leadership of Hamas, which
has resisted his secret efforts to prevent or moderate their plans to attack Israel. Morsi
recognizes Hamas' anger after the death of al-Jabari, but notes that this move and Hamas' calls
for help from the new regimes of the Arab Spring puts his new Islamist Government under
pressure inside of Egypt. Morsi noted that more radical Islamic leaders in Egypt are now
calling for war with Israel and even his more traditional political opponents are criticizing his
government and the new leadership of the Army for not being more forceful during this crisis.
Morsi's advisors point out that the new governments in Libya and Tunisia will face the same
pressure that could threaten their internal stability.


       4. (Source Comment: This knowledgeable individual adds that al-Sissi is concerned
privately that the situation in Gaza will escalate beyond the capacity of any individual or
government to control. He adds that certain IDF liaison officers point out in secret that
Netanyahu is unpredictable, the Hamas leaders are fanatics, and Morsi is a new leader with a
precarious hold on his country, which creates a dangerous environment. Al-Sissi has not shared
this particular view with the Egyptian President, wishing to avoid undercutting his confidence at
this critical time.)
