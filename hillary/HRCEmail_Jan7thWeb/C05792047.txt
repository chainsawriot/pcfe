-For B. Rapaport, we also just got date so will add to your schedule.
- For California, we had thought not ok to go with him but ok to come back. But we will confirm. We also just heard
about Brazil but his office wants to be sure you have a ride home. We will work with them.
- For Pathways, hasn't been discussed widely                                      We have foundation date range but
depends on venue which will determine date. We will keep tracking. Assumed you wanted to attend so we will stay on
top of it.
- we will put little rock trustees on as option. I did tell them unlikely you would go based on our discussion but obviously
its something you can decide at last minute. I know stephanie and others don't think its worth a trip for club of madrid
but we will keep on calender as well.
- as for exhibit/airport date, will be in October as we discussed. That's the soonest they think the airport will be ready
and since they want to stagger appearances at exhibit, should work well.
- friday 4pm. Got it.

Will add dates for #1 and #4 and follow up accordingly.
I am currently vetting the plane for #2.
Will wait for Huma's direction on #3.
Yes you are all set next Friday on the 2pm shuttle. I believe Huma was relaying to the boys but will be sure Terry has as
well.

Subject: Schedule

1) There will be a memorial service for B Rapaport in DC on May 15 at 5pm that I have to go to. I don't know where but
Bill is speaking.

2) Can I fly w Bill to California June 14 if one of the events he's doing is a Democratic party fundraiser altho the other is
charitable? What are the rules? Can I fly back w him? But he may fly straight to Brazil according to his schedule. We
need to sort out so I can make plans.

3) The Foundation is holding Oct 25, 29 and 30 for its Gala in NYC so I'd like option of doing. If it is the 25th, that likely
means no Pathways in Cali, Columbia. HUMA--do you know anything more about the date?

4) Bill is having his Foundation retreat Nov 9-11 in Little Rock. PIs put as option for me. And also as option the Club of
Madrid there Dec. 17-18. WE STILL NEED LR DATES FOR THE EXHIBIT ON OUR MOTHERS AND THE AIRPORT DEDICATION.

5) Pis be sure Bill's office knows we have a mtg in the City at 4 on Friday--same place as one last month. And, I assume
I'm on the 2pm shuttle?
