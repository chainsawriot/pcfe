Subject:                      Briefing today



A report from Toria on today's briefing (she and I are talking through how to background this):

I got: Is Aid not getting in? Batted it back hard, using the lines we'd worked this morning on 900
pieces and all the training. I also got in a bit of a dig that equipment is going into Syria not to those
outside which is why those outside may be griping. I think it's gone. For now. Now they are all
into: what other redlines does Prez have? Are we closer on a NFZ?

Also, fysa, lotsa push today on whether Egypt is in violation of Peace Treaty with its Sinai ops and
whether Israelis asked us to warn Egyptians (as they told Israeli press). I danced on the importance of
security in Sinai, and using mechanisms of Treaty for transparency and CBM. But q of "violations" is
coming back tomorrow.
