Subject: Seoul Calm

Things are under control here. I met with the FM right after their national security and emergency cabinet
meetings. Their approach mirrors ours: stay calm, watch closely, avoid provocation, coordinate closely. General
Thurman had similar discussions with his counterparts.

ROKs will decide soon whether to do a condolence statement and whether• to propose a delegation to PY.

We'll soon send a comprehensive cable on Seoul's reaction.
