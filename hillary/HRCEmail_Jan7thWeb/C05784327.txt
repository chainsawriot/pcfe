Dear Gordon,

As we discussed Tuesday, we have been working hard to put together a team and a plan to support your efforts in
Tunisia. We in Washington continue to be motivated to seize the tremendous opportunity we face in Tunisia and
to ensure that your efforts are a success.

I wanted to write to describe our expectations for the transition team, its charge, and how its members would link into
your Embassy and Washington.
