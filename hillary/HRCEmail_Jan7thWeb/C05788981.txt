No worries - do you want me to resend you the tracked changes version tomorrow morning, or do you think it is good to
go? In which case I can print/autopen/scan and pass to Heather for delivery.

When last we emailed about this I had sent you Ambassador Cousin's edits as tracked changes. I was waiting for your
approval/further edits. Unfortunately, I can't seem to locate that doc on my blackberry. If you want, I can go into the
office today and send it to you and/or print, autopen, and scan it so Heather can e-mail it to Josette.

 SG's office just told me that they plan to make the announcement on Tuesday, subject to confirmation from FAO DG.
 The SG's spokesperson will do it in NY at the noon briefing. They'll let me know over the weekend if there is any change.
