Subject: Boeing-Thank you

Dear Kurt - I want to personally thank you and your entire Indonesia team for the assistance and guidance you provided
leading up to the Lion Air Agreement Ambassador Marciel's soft touch                 Meredith's enthusiasm and
coordination with me on a weekly basis, Jim's advice and on the ground support as we looked to an East Asia Summit
deliverable, Joe's willingness to talk me through how to approach this, Jim Loi's connective abilities, Andrew's DC
coordination leading to the event and Marc's willingness to fly to Seattle last minute and help us work with the Amb all
coupled with your leadership throughout and last minute reach to get us over the finish line were simply outstanding.
Your team is truly emblematic of real commercial diplomacy in effective action. The event in Bali exceeded ours and our
customer's expectations. Boeing is proud to make history with you on our team.

Warmest regards,
Julie

P.S. Please pass this on to all who helped on the ground...I know there were others.

Indonesia. Indicated as much to the NSC last week and again yesterday (sent them the MOA as well as emails from
senior Execs saying it was done). I know Drew contacted the President's scheduler about the signing event yesterday
but we (and he as of this morning) have not heard back yet — hoping to before delegation leaves Honolulu.

This deal,                                                                                       will be huge on the   B4
economic impact and jobs front.




Many thanks,
Julie
