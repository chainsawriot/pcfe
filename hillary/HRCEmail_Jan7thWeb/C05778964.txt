fyi. Sure you know this about Suleiman, Mukhabarat chief not exactly the people's candidate. The torture background will
undoubtedly circulate quickly (AI Jazeera, Internet, Twitter).

Who Is Omar Suleiman?
Posted by Jane Mayer
One of the "new" names being mentioned as a possible alternative to President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, Omar Suleiman,
is actually not so new to anyone who has followed the American policy of renditions for terror suspects. After dissolving
his cabinet yesterday, Mubarak appointed Suleiman vice-president, and according to many commentators he is poised to
be a potential successor, and an alternative to Mubarak's son and intended heir until now, Gamal Mubarak. Suleiman is a
well-known quantity in Washington. Suave, sophisticated, and fluent in English, he has served for years as the main
conduit between the United States and Mubarak. While he has a reputation for loyalty and effectiveness, he also carries
some controversial baggage from the standpoint of those looking for a clean slate on human rights. As I described in my
book "The Dark Side," since 1993 Suleiman has headed the feared Egyptian general intelligence service. In that capacity,
he was the C.I.A.'s point man in Egypt for renditions—the covert program in which the C.I.A. snatched terror suspects
from around the world and returned them to Egypt and elsewhere for interrogation, often under brutal circumstances.
As laid out in greater detail by Stephen Grey, in his book "Ghost Plane," beginning in the nineteen-nineties, Suleiman
negotiated directly with top Agency officials. Every rendition was greenlighted at the highest levels of both the U.S. and
Egyptian intelligence agencies. Edward S. Walker, Jr., a former U.S. Ambassador to Egypt, described Suleiman as "very
bright, very realistic," adding that he was cognizant that there was a downside to "some of the negative things that the
Egyptians engaged in, of torture and so on. But he was not squeamish, by the way."
Technically, U.S. law required the C.I.A. to seek "assurances" from Egypt that rendered suspects wouldn't face torture.
But under Suleiman's reign at the intelligence service, such assurances were considered close to worthless. As Michael
Scheuer, a former C.I.A. officer who helped set up the practice of rendition, later testified before Congress, even if such
"assurances" were written in indelible ink, "they weren't worth a bucket of warm spit."

I'm sure you must have received all possible options from highly informed


people, but in what is likely to be redundant and certainly less informed than


others here is my two cents for what it's worth.




Renewed calls for an end to violence at this point may only appear as implicit


encouragement to Mubarak to suppress the revolution quickly. Mubarak has already


lost. Egyptian society has made its decision. He may succeed in quelling the


revolution, but in doing so will only guarantee a fiercer and more radical


outcome in the future. That is not in the US interest.




I suspect measures short of the following will likely lead to convulsive


violence with.the least positive results in Egypt and radical discrediting of


the US position in Egypt and the Arab world:




1.        Mubarak should immediately declare that neither he nor his son will be


candidates in national elections to be held in the fall. He should invite UN and


international observers to insure that these elections are conducted freely and


fairly.


2.        The US should inform Mubarak that future aid will be contingent on free

and fair elections in the fall in which neither he nor his son are candidates.


3.       The US should inform Mubarak that if, after his announcement of these


elections, during the transition period, the Egyptian police engages in acts of


political suppression and brutality, the US will vote for a UN resolution and


sanctions against his regime—and US aid will be contingent on adherence to


standards of universal human rights in the UN charter to which Egypt is a


signatory.




Needless to say, the Egyptian revolution augurs an intense focus on the collapse


of US initiatives on Israel-Palestine. Be prepared to take the consequences


(while Bibi's government and US neocons bark incessantly about "delegitimation"


of Israel, the PA is actually delegitimatized;- plus post-Egyptian revolution,


without renewed pressure, the US position will enter a new cycle of


delegitimation in the Arab world from the Bosporus to the Nile), or be prepared


with a much tougher line forcing the process regardless of potential fallout in


US 2012 election cycle. In the best possible outcome now, if we are really


lucky, with a freely elected Egyptian government, the US hand will be forced in


any case.
