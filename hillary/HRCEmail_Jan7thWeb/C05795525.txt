Jake,

I received this note on Wednesday while traveling, soon after the news of the death of Chris Stevens broke. It is
from Bob Bergdahl, father of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. Please convey it to the Secretary.

Best,

Barneu

Dear Barney,

Please convey our abiding condolences to everyone in Foreign Service.
Your service is most noble and almost invisible.
Our Nation is stumbling through a very volatile world.
The "Crusade" paradigm will never be forgotten in this part of the world and we force our
Diplomats to carry a lot of baggage around while walking on eggshells.

Be very careful my friend!
