Subject:                           Hi



Sorry I wasn't much help on secure conference call today -- wonders of modern technology.                              B6
I talked subsequently to Wendy and Jake, and think where you came out on              subject is exactly right.         B5



                                                                                                                        B5


Hope you've had chance to relax a little. It's so nice being away                  -- puts DC in better perspective.    B6

All best,

Bill
