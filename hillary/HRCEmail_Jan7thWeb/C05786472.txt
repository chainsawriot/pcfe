                                       STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON


It is with regret that I have accepted the resignation of Philip J. Crowley as Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs. PJ
has served our nation with distinction for more than three decades, in uniform and as a civilian. His service to country is
motivated by a deep devotion to public policy and public diplomacy, and I wish him the very best. Principal Deputy Assistant
Secretary (PDAS) Michael Hammer will serve as Acting Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs.


                                            STATEMENT BY PHILIP J. CROWLEY

The unauthorized disclosure of classified information is a serious crime under U.S. law. My recent comments regarding the
conditions of the pre-trial detention of Private First Class Bradley Manning were intended to highlight the broader, even
strategic impact of discreet actions undertaken by national security agencies every day and their impact on our global standing
and leadership. The exercise of power in today's challenging times and relentless media environment must be prudent and
consistent with our laws and values.

Given the impact of my remarks, for which I take full responsibility, I have submitted my resignation as Assistant Secretary for
Public Affairs and Spokesman for the Department of State.

I am enormously grateful to President Obama and Secretary Clinton for the high honor of once again serving the American
people. I leave with great admiration and affection for my State colleagues, who promote our national interest both on the front
lines and in the quiet corners of the world. It was a privilege to help communicate their many and vital contributions to our
national security. And I leave with deep respect for the journalists who report on foreign policy and global developments every
day, in many cases under dangerous conditions and subject to serious threats. Their efforts help make governments more
responsible, accountable and transparent.
                                                                 #
