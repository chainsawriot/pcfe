Hrc, think only way to get call done is if we offer a new time. moroccans said no to our original offer and Ed keeps calling
saying King wants to talk.

The King went into a meeting but we can offer 3:30pm, at the end of your call-o-rama. Does that work for you?

Checking now. He left a pouch at your residence of the items you can keep.

You'll notice on the schedule in your pouch from the office, that the Somali president is listed at 2:45. We are hoping to
move that to 3pm in case Day goes long. Is that OK with you?
