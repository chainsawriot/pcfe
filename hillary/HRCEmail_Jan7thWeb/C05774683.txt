Re. Nairobi,            et al.           Had a terrific meetng w. P. Kennedy. It was solid/ a definite possible path forward.
Still lots of wrinkles re policy/politics.   But.     I couldn't have been happier w the effort put into a solution- if u were
in the rm ur self.                 So. Thx. Know can't gurantee an outcome--- only our best effort. And that's being
done.                -     A. Big. Big. Thanks 11111        PS. How about that SCOTUS.           Health. Decision. 11 11111
