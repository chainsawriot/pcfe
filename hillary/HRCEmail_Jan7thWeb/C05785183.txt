Dear Hillary,

Valerie here. Many thanks for even spending a moment to consider this request... it means a lot. I am so grateful to
Global Zero that I can continue the sort of proliferation work I did while at the Agency - they are a very serious, good
organization. Wishing you all the best in your important work - you truly are an inspiration to millions - and certainly to
me.

Sending you our best. Valerie and Joe

Dear Joe and Valerie,

I wish I could join you at the Reagan Library for the Summit, but the tyranny of my schedule just wouldn't permit. So,
please give me the proverbial raincheck.

And, I'm delighted that the good work on energy in Africa continues. Happy we can be of help.

All the best to you and your fabulous children--H

Dear Hillary,
I understand that Ellen Tauscher has sent you a recommendation that you speak at this event in October. I wanted you
to know that Valerie is a prominent member of the leadership committee as is Queen Noor. Valerie would be writing
herself except she is in NYC doing a public service announcement for Global Zero with Naomi Watts, so I want to say in
her stead how honored we would be if you are able to fit the event into your schedule. Your support would be
invaluable and put the administration firmly on the record as supporting an objective now embraced by.many former
leaders.
On another subject, thank you so much for your help with GE. We are working with AF who have been very supportive.
As always, all best. Joe
