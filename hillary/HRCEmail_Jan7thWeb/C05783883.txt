All:

Ops has provided below the latest Stevens update on Benghazi:

    •    Traffic accident: Police have accepted the USG version of the story: that it was an accident and the
         victims were not wearing seatbelts. The USG employees were returning from the airport when the
         incident occurred. A total of four people died and six injured. USG employee injuries are light if any.
         Our people are standing by pending official USG instructions. Stevens notes there is a UK flight
         tomorrow they could be on if necessary. The TNC wants to do a press release to quell the rumor mill.
         Stevens will send the draft back to Department for L and PA clearance.

    •    The British envoy departs tomorrow on permanent change of station. There will be a gap before his
         replacement, John Jenkins, arrives from Baghdad.

    •    TNC head Mahrnoud Jibril will be going to Jordan and will not be back in Benghazi until Friday. The
         development is likely to be met with additional criticism that he is spending too much time abroad at the
         expense of other government affairs.

Thanks,

Dan
