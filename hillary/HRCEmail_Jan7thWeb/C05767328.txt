Maura and I just spoke and she is aware of this possible alternate plan. Wally has been trying to contact Cassia with no luck. If
anyone has alternate contact info, that would be most helpful.

Also, need to know where the plane is going (POE) and whether anyone is screening on the ground or they will be able to board
without the parole authorization in their hands.

If this can happen this way, someone please give Maura Nicholson the authorization so they can start the machinery here in Haiti.
Also let Cassia know. KM

Ali,

This brings a lot of clarity to the situation. There was no hold up at CBP/DC. Just got off the line with AC Winkowski, let's get the
children on he plane and we will parole at point of entry. Will need the following asap to facilitate:

- names
- airport flying into and time
- accompanying escorts
- any info available that CIS has that they may have.

Let's get the kids on the plane.

All,

We are working the issue. Adding Wally Bird here who has been talking to the folks involved. We approved parole for the children. .
Were not supposed to pick up the travel docs today, but rather tomorrow. We did not expect them to fly today and there appeals to
have been a miscommunication on flight plans. If CBP can parole at the POE and allow them to plane, we will forward the USCIS
parole authorizations to CBP.

Subject: Urgent Q

I am so sorry to bother you on a Sunday. And I know we generally think systematic and institutional fixes preferred but I also know
we think if we can fix something we should. This is an example of the latter which illustrates the need for the former. We - Paul
Farmer and all with him- are on a flight leaving at 545- a private plane              and have space for 2 babies (whom my Dad met
when here) who need heart surgery and their mothers and doctors in boston waiting to admit them and operate- tomorrow. We heard
from the local DHS/Customs folks they approved their travel documents yesterday (after receiving the necessary ID forms- another
story). Now thought the Embassy says they can't print them because they're waiting for approval from DHS in DC?? ie its not a State
Dept issue but a DHS/Customs issue. Any ideas on what we can do? Details below from Cassia
                                  We have probably an hour. So sorry to bother you today. I can call you too or we can call someone
directly- if you've any suggestions. Or??
Thank you

    Cassia and Amber:



    Glad to hear Sanley made it to Boston. Great news?

    I know yesterday was quite chaotic.



    I have authorized the parole for                  and their accompanying parents.



    This authorization was sent to our Field Office Director Pius Bannis.

    I have sent him Cassia and          phone numbers in Port au Prince.



    Before the children and parents can travel, they will require travel documents.

    These should be obtained at the US Embassy in PaP.

    I will send you more details as I receive them as to how to obtain them.

    Can you please tell me what their flight information will be?



     I just got your phone message re. affidavits. Anyone who might be able to vouch for the relationship between the parents

    Of                    can write affidavits and sign them. Those who can testify to their birth are preferred, but if your contact   B6
     At the Comfort would like to do it, that is ok too. You can scan them to my email, or fax.



    If you need to reach me, email is best, as my blackberry seems a bit broken (at least the voice partâ€”it's sounding like Darth
Vader!)

      She's getting off the plane now...I'm still waiting for her, but I
      spoke to the flight attendants who said she was doing great until the
      end when she started to have a lot of pain. We're off to BWH as soon
      as she's wheeled off. More later
