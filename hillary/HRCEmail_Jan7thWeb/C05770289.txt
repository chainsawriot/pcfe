Subject:                           nutrition speech



To more fully answer your question, the CARE speech is important because it focuses on a chronically overlooked issue
(nutrition) that sits at the intersection of two of your signature issues. It gives us an opportunity to sharpen our
development message. It also tees up the health care speech you might give before UNGA. This is a speech that only
you could give and a number of constituencies will be delighted by it.


Hope this helps. I'm going through it now to make sure it more clearly answers your question.


Thank you!
