Subject: More aftershocks hit NZ city; fears worse to come (AP)


WELLINGTON (AP) - Big aftershocks are continuing to hit the earthquake-weary city of Christchurch, raising
fears that worse could be on the way.
   A pair of aftershocks woke many residents at about 6:30 a.m. Wednesday, with the larger measuring
magnitude-5.0. In the afternoon, a second smaller cluster hit.
   The temblors follow Monday's 6.0 quake that caused some more buildings in the city to collapse. The city is
still recovering from a devestating magnitude-6.3 quake in February that killed 181 people and shut down much
of the inner city. Since then, residents have suffered through thousands of aftershocks.
   Scientists say this week's series of quakes have increased to about 30 percent the likelihood that Christchurch
will suffer another devestating quake within the next year.
