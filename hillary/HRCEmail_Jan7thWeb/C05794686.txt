  SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as
  the highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.



          1. During mid-June 2012 senior Libyan intelligence and security officials received
  confidential information from INTERPOL and the Austrian State Police indicating that both
  organizations believe that the drowning death of former Libyan Prime Minister and Oil Minister
  Shokri Ghanem in Vienna during late April 2012 remains highly suspicious, and their discreet
  investigations will continue. According to a very sensitive source, until the investigation is
  complete, the Austrian authorities will continue to state publicly that they believe that it is most
  likely Ghanem committed suicide by throwing himself into the Danube River as a result of a
  prolonged, serious illness.

           2. According to this source, INTERPOL provided the Austrians with sensitive evidence
  indicating that when Ghanem headed the Libyan National Oil Corporation (NOC), he authorized
  the delivery of crude oil shipments to overseas oil companies, prior to the completion of proper
  sales agreements. The firms included PetroChina and Sinopec's trading company, Unipec. In
  March 2012 the National Transitional Council (NTC) interim Government of Libya requested
  that Interpol detain Ghanem for questioning in this matter. At the same time sensitive sources in
  Libya and Austria indicate that the NTC planned to use Ghanem as a prosecution witness in the
  trial of Saif al-Islam Qaddafi, the former heir apparent to the late dictator Muammar al Qaddafi,
  who, among many other things, is accused of corruption in administering the oil industry during
  his father's rule. The trades in question took place between June 2008 and 2010, and were first
  raised with the NTC by NOC' s former head of marketing Najwa el-Beshti.



          3. According to this individual, el-Beshti first raised the matter during the Qaddafi
  regime. After a cursory investigation, Qaddafi's investigators declared that there had been no
  sale of oil without prior contracts, as is now alleged. The investigators, whom the NTC officials
  believe were protecting Ghanem and Saif al-Islam, did admit that, despite repeated warnings
  from NOC's contracts section, the firm's trading arm was regularly selling oil at less than the
  market price. The Qaddafi investigators concluded that the traders understanding of oil pricing
  was poor but not criminal. Again, NTC officials now say that this investigation was designed to
  divert attention from Saif al-Islam's activities. The Qaddafi-era investigation focused on the
  supply of two cargos of crude oil to ExxonMobil in 2008 made below the contracted quality,
  leading to a loss of almost $4 million. At that time the U.S. firm demanded compensation from
  the NOC.



          4. In the opinion of these sources, the NTC authorities believe that in fact there is a
  different, more problematic situation at play regarding oil trades that involved the sale of Libyan
  crude oil at less than the market price. They believe that part of the difference may have been
  paid by the oil companies into bank accounts other than those controlled by the NOC.



          5. These same sources note that unlike the Government of Russia, China indicated earlier
  this year that it was not prepared to return to Libya to pursue some of its 50 planned projects
  worth $19 billion. The Chinese authorities stated that they were concerned by the security
  situation and difficulty in obtaining valid visas for their workers. However, NTC sources in
  Tripoli indicate that before returning to Libya, Beijing is actually demanding compensation for
  losses suffered during the revolution. One the most important Chinese projects was the $12
  billion 3,170 mile national rail network. According to sensitive sources, Chinese firms were
  contracted to build most of the project, with Russian firms supporting the effort. As the 2011

  revolution against Qaddafi develop, the rail network was put on hold last March, through a
  combination of budgetary constraints and lingering NTC antipathy for the Russian and Chinese
  support of Qaddafi during the revolution. These individuals note that despite these
  complications, Unipec and PetroChina have continued to buy Libyan crude oil.



          6. (Source Comment: These dealings with large foreign firms have also served to alarm
  Libyan businessmen, as they attempt to step up operations in the wake of the revolution.
  According to a very sensitive source, Tripoli's Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture
  is continuing to protest to the NTC Government regarding the new ministerial decree that
  enables foreign companies to more easily establish Libyan joint ventures, branches and
  representative offices in most sectors, including oil and gas. In the opinion of this individual,
  these businessmen are telling Jalil that their principle concern is Article 9 of the Ministry of
  Economy decree number 103, which permits outside companies to establish branches in a range
  of industries, including the oil sector. The Chamber's president Khalil Mahfouz told Jalil that
  member businesses fear for the future of Libyan oil service companies, if foreign firms are
  permitted to compete on a level playing field. Mahfouz also stated that senior members of the
  chamber met with Industry Minister Dr. Muhammad Mahmoud Al-Fteissi and further meetings
  were expected prior to the national election in late June.)



          7. In the opinion of these sources, the open nature of Decree 103 surprised both the local
  and foreign business communities, who were expecting a continuation, with a few amendments,
  of the conservative and protectionist legislation put in place under the old regime. These Libyan
  businessmen admit that there are still a dozen sectors where foreign partnerships are proscribed,
  including retail and wholesaling, import, catering, agencies and distributorships, auditing and
  legal practices, quarrying and contracting and construction for contracts worth less than LD 30
  million. However, the Chamber of Commerce fears that the government may open up these
  areas as well. These individuals are concerned that they will lose out, now that foreign firms will
  no longer going to be obliged to have local agents. The leaders of the Chamber believe that
  overseas competition is likely to damage the business of less efficient Libya companies. In
  response, the NTC points out that firms that can form successful partnerships with outside
  concerns are likely to benefit in terms of management know-how and technology transfer.



          8. (Source Comment: Jalil discussed this matter with is senior advisors, and according to
  a sensitive source, expressed concern that many of these local businesses will support
  conservative Islamist candidates in the coming elections, if they fear losing business to foreign
  firms.)
