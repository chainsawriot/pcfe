Also, I might like to take the WP 8:10. I haven't done that in a long time and never w DS. So they'd have to be prepared
and talk over w USSS about what door to go thru etc. And I always used to be able to check my bag outside by the stairs
leading up to the plane which were always small. Can you find out if it's a jet or a prop.

Subject: Schedule for January 3rd-6th (updated)

MS, please find below the updated schedule for next week. A few things of note:

    1. I have you on the 10:00am shuttle down on Tuesday. The only missing piece to Tuesday is
                                                                — we had originally taken it off your
       calendar when we didn't have plans to be in DC.
    7.
    5.                                                     Shuttle back at 7:00pm which is a little
       tight but not imnossible.
    6.                                                   — we are invited with a plus one, checking to
           see who is available/best to attend.
