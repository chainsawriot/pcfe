Dell

Thank you for reaching out to me. I hope you are doing well.

I met with Bob Toracell yesterday; he came to share his role in this matter as well as the broad partnership of advocates
on this matter including, among others, Gov Richardson's support.

Please give him my best regards and let him know we appreciate his willingness to come in on this matter but given
Bob's visit he is off the hook!

All the best

Cdm

We met several months after Secy Clinton moved into the position. I was the Coordinator for CT prior to Dan Benjamin. I
am following up on a request from Gov Bill Richardson which went thru Ms Lauren Jiloty.

Gov Richardson would like to meet with Secy Clinton at a time convenient with her to discuss the delisting of the MEK
from the Foreign Terror Organization list. There are several bipartisan supporting governors (Dean, Ridge) , intelligence
(Hayden) justice (Mukasey, Freeh) military (Pace, Shelton) and others that would like to attend.

We would ask for only 30 mins, express support with some sincere comments, insights, and depart        realizing there is
much going on in the world directly affecting the Secretary and State!!!

Is it possible to get on her calendar some time within the next 30 days?
