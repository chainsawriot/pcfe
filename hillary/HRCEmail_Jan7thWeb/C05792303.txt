Subject: RE: CODEL Cantor - Aug 14

S/HSC has both briefed Cantor's staff and is providing materials (which H is clearing on). Regardless, it doesn't hurt for
us to provide a briefing to Cantor (phone or otherwise), and I'll call his office now to make the offer.

Regarding what Cantor's interested in, his staff has always indicated that he wanted to do some "work" while his family
was on a cruise in the Caribbean. The only detail we have ever gotten from his staff is that he would like to see
"projects" near Cap Haitien, but that they indicated that the choice of Cap Haitien was based on logistics (the closest to
where the cruise ship was sailing) not for any other purposes. We've asked about the trip and have been working with
his staff on the trip, but this is as much as they've commented on. It is worth noting that Cantor has not generally
expressed a strong interest in foreign policy matters.

I will offer the briefing to Cantor today and let you know if they take us up on it.

S/HSC has prepared briefing documents for this visit and Tom spoke with Cantor staffer Robert Story
Karem before going on vacation. Depending on Joy's views, we can do a verbal briefing at Mr.
Cantor's convenience although he is probably back in his District, but we can certainly do this over the
phone.

Our understanding thus far is that he and his family are on a cruise that stops in Labadie and he is
using the opportunity to do an official event which will be supported by the Embassy. DCM
Desjardins and Carl Anderson of USAID (control officer) will be meeting with Cantor and doing the
briefing and escorting. Staff accepted the rational that since Ambassador White has just arrived, it
was preferable to have the DCM handle this visit.

John Boris has been collecting the briefer working with the Embassy and our office to give him a
comprehensive view of activities in the North but the focus will be on visiting operations at the
Caracol Industrial Park.
