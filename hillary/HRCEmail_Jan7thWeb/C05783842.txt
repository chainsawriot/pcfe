Kate:

Could you please pass this note on to Kurt, Joe, and Patrick (I know Joe is away, and I talked with Patrick
earlier this morning).

Kurt:

I want to congratulate you and your colleagues on what I regard as a brilliant (and I do not use that term

changes in Myanmar, and what I regard as almost a plea from the Burmese for support to the reforms, might not
get more than simply a verbal response. But this indicates the seriousness of the U.S. intent, and I hope will
prompt the further positive actions from the Burmese that we all want. This State Department action avoids any
congressional issues and yet is a strong signal and so is tactically and strategically important.

Thank all of you for your efforts, because I believe they further U.S. national interests and could assist the
Burmese people as well.


By the way, we have approval from the MacArthur Foundation for our Track 1.5 initiative, and will be working
with Joe and Derek on that.

Best wishes,

David Steinberg
