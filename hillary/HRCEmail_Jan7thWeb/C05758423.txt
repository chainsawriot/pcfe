E is Europe.

E3 is UK, France, and Germany.

+3 is US, China, Russia

So it's the same 6 as the P5+1, just a different name.

        What does it mean? What is the E and who are the three?

        I'm being told -- and still trying to verify -- that as of last week, we've succumbed to the Europeans' preferred
term. That there was interagency discussion of this, and that going forward, we will join the rest of the world in calling
the P5+1 the E3+3.

        This is the first I've heard of this, but I will track it down.

               Why don't we keep using P5+1?

            I will forward these changes - we have made a few other tweaks.

            We believe that it is useful to distribute it as your brief oral testimony (you've been asked to speak for 7-10
minutes -- this is 11 or so).

            On the E3+3 v. P5+1, they are identical, just different names.
