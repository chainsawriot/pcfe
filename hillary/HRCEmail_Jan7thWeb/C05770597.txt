SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED


IRAN

    •   Jim noted that he and Bill Burns will brief the House on Iran today.

KOREA


    •   Details have already leaked to the press, but S. Korean Government will make its formal announcement on the
        sinking of the Cheonan early tomorrow their time (late today here).

BUDGET


    •   Pat provided a readout on Jack's gloomy meeting with Chairman Obey. Obey thinks that the cuts to the State
        budget in the Senate budget resolution were the "minimum" we would take. On the Supplemental, he
        predicted there will be moves to trim our account in order to fund domestic programs like teacher training.

CONGRESSIONAL ISSUES


    •   The House Armed Services Committee will mark up the Defense Authorization Act today. Includes a number of
        issues of interest to us, including some GTMO-related measures aimed at keeping GTMO open. (One
        amendment would shut down Dan Fried's operation.) WH has not been much engaged yet, but it is still early.

    •   The Secretary did a great job on START yesterday. She and Gates and Mullen will next testify on June 17 before
        the Senate Armed Services Committee. There may be more technical questions there.

    •   There is a chance we will have an Iran sanctions bill before Memorial Day.

PUBLIC AFFAIRS


    •   PJ said he thought we were in as good a position as possible on Iran right now.

    •   The Senate Intelligence Committee will release its report on the Christmas Day aborted bombing.

    •   We have received a letter from Senators McCain and Kyle demanding that Michael Posner "retract" his alleged
        apology to the Chinese over the Arizona immigration law.
