Dear Henry




Happy New Year to you â€” it is wonderful to hear from you.




I appreciate the vagaries of life that takes us down various roads and am happy to hear that yours might wind you back
this way.




Let me check in with the WH on whether Mr. Nathanson has withdrawn and follow back up.




Best.

Dear Cheryl:




Happy New Year.l hope this email finds you well and thriving in your important job.




I write because I learned yesterday via the Washington Post that Mr. Nathanson, who had been nominated to be our
Ambassador to the Czech Republic, was withdrawing from consideration




All this by way of saying that I hope you will convey this email to Secretary Clinton and also give her my very best wishes
for the New Year. From all I can see and tell she has done a truly extraordinary job and we are all in her(and your)debt.




Best regards




Henry
