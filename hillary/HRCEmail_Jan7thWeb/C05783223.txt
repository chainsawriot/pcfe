Subject: Update 1: Hikers Not Yet Released

(SBU) Contrary to earlier reports, the Iran desk comments the Swiss Ambassador to Tehran informed the
Department at 0800 EDT that Bauer and Fattal had not yet been released but the process was underway and
tracking closely with the process Sarah Shourd's release followed. The Iran desk adds the Ambassador does not
expect to take custody of the hikers until they are taken to the airport. She believes the hikers will be
transferred directly from the prison to the airport. Media report their release is imminent. The Iran Desk
comments the Swiss Ambassador is outside of the prison with Omani officials.

Subject: Iran Hikers Released, Airplane en route to Tehran (SBU)

(SBU) Embassy Muscat says Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal, the two U.S. citizens detained in Iran since mid-
2009, have been released into the custody of the Omani Envoy in Tehran and notes an Omani airplane is en
route to Tehran to retrieve the hikers.

(SBU) Embassy Dubai notes the Irani Judiciary's Office of Public Relations and Protocol said in a statement
that Branch 36 of Tehran's Appellate Court agreed to their release. The text of the short statement follows:
According to the Judiciary's Office of Public Relations and Protocol, following the two American citizens'
lawyer's request to Branch 36 of the Tehran Appellate Court to implement their bail order, after they had been
sentenced to mutable sentences of 8 years in prison by Branch 15 of the Tehran Revolutionary Court, Branch 36
of the Appellate Court, as the jurisdiction for this appeal, agreed to this request, and by transforming the
temporary custody order to a bail order, and by issuing the approval of bail at 5 billion rials (500 million
toumans, about US$500,000) for each defendant, freed the abovementioned until the definite verdict is issued.
