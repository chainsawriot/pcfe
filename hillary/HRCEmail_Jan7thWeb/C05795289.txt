Hi cheryl,

I look fwd to attending the speech this morning.

I had one last minute request - I understand that in the final version there is no reference to the child survival call to
action, but their is a reference to family planning efforts. Could you and josh try to make sure there is some specific
reference to the call to action?

Also, in terms of acknowledgements it would be good to note tom friedan's leadership as everyone is sensitive to our ghi
transition and we want to continue to send the usaid-pepfar-cdc working together public message. I don't know if he is
there, but wanted to flag.

Look forward to it.

Raj
