Subject: CSCC: Time to Go

Friday is my last day at CSCC. Diane Parsont will be acting until Amb. Alberto Fernandez
arrives on March 26. For any loose ends, I'll be in the area and on email as I process
through the retirement program at FSI. (Diane knows that we owe Jake and Alice a
draft briefing for the DCI and possibly other S counterparts.)

CSCC is in good shape but there is still a lot to do, especially in getting key posts
overseas fully engaged in our line of work and building skilled interagency teams to
assist them. Our digital efforts are strong but they need to continue to evolve
intelligently into social media and link up better with related work across government.

I have enjoyed working with a very good group of people at CSCC, but we could not have
built this little enterprise without the hands-on support of the Secretary and
yourselves. Thank you.

I'm retiring from the Foreign Service but not putting myself out to pasture
completely. I'll continue to seek interesting, challenging projects with interesting,
challenging people. My email:

With warm regards,
Richard

Coordinator
Center for Strategic Counterterrorism
