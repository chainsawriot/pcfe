Subject: Breakout Session Feedback

Cheryl,

I thought you might like some feedback on my breakout session sustainable development. It was a great idea and all the
COMs appreciated the sessions. Never in my career have I witnessed anything like it because ambassadors were
exchanging ideas and best practices with each other. This is why we recommend that some kind of share point or blog
be established perhaps for all the sessions to continue the dialogue.

Amb Pamela White added value as a real development practitioner. The following COMs had some great ideas and we
should reach out to them again. They included: Ambassadors Merton, Booth, Symington, Nesbitt, Ordway, and of
course Ertharin Cousin.

We had excellent participation. The first day we had about 20 COMs and the second we had more than 20 -- some folks
showed up who were not on the list. This meant that it was a bit of a juggling act to get some COMs not to hog the
discussion and others to speak up. So, we could have used more time -- 15-30 minutes more.

The additions of Todd Stern, Eric Goosby, Sharon Cromer and Don Steinberg were good, but Don went on a bit too long
about QDDR and USAID's re-empowered role.

One thing that came through loud and clear was that COMs want to be more involved in the planning and budgeting
process.

Thanks for letting me participate, Pat
