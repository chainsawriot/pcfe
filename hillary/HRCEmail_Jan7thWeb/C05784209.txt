ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's intelligence chief has reportedly asked the United States to stop its drone
strikes in the country, a newspaper reported on Sunday, touching on an issue that has become more sensitive
since the killing of Osama bin Laden strained ties.

   The local Express Tribune said Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Director Ahmad Shuja Pasha made the
request in a meeting on Saturday with CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell.

   "We will be forced to respond if you do not come up with a strategy that stops the drone strikes," Pasha is
reported to have told Morell, the newspaper said on its website.
