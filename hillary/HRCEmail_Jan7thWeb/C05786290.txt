Should we have someone go on the record to refute or just leave alone?

Also, in the 2 years he worked in government, was he ever consistent on anything?

Him criticizing the President for consistency is a real doozy.

Crowley hits Obama's 'inconsistency do'

P.J. Crowley is speaking out against President Barack Obama' policies on the Middle East, charging his former
boss with adopting an "inconsistency doctrine" on the region and urging intervention in Syria.

Crowley, who stepped down as the State Department's top spokesman last month, writes Friday that the Obama
administration has yet to solidify its position on how to handle uprisings across the Arab world, but needs to do
so. In particular, he calls for the president to get involved in the emerging conflict in Syria.

"Although Obama seemed to embrace the concept of "responsibility to protect" in intervening in Libya and
calling for Muammar Qadhafi to step down from power, he has not done the same in Syria," Crowley says in a
column published by The Daily Beast. "If Qadhafi must go because he is unwilling to reform and has employed
extreme state-controlled violence against a population that no longer fears him, so should President Bashar al-
Assad."

Crowley resigned after voicing his opinion on the military's treatment of Bradley Manning, the Army private
accused of providing classified documents to WikiLeaks, saying that it was "ridiculous and counterproductive
and stupid."

Crowley's view is one that many administration observers, foreign policy experts and members of Congress
have taken, but this is the first time it has been voiced by someone who was, until recently, privy to high-level
deliberations.

The Obama administration took the path toward military intervention in Libya in part because it was a
straightforward one, Crowley suggests, while the situation in Syria is more complicated. U.S. officials aren't
sure that Assad' s ouster will result in the installation of a better one, and see "no viable military option in
Syria," he says.

Nonetheless, Crowley insists that the United States must find a way to stop the humanitarian crisis there, too.

"If the United States is committed to promoting responsible, accountable, and representative government
around the world, it cannot just do so where it is easy. It should do so where it matters," he says. "If Gaddafi has
forfeited his legitimacy, then Assad is as well, and the world's most powerful democracy should say so now,
when it matters."
