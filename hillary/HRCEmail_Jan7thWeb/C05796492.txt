Thank you, Cheryl.


I would propose that Jen arrive on Monday, November 5 (that is, in two weeks, since she will need time to make

her own arrangements in Colombia). My last day in the office would be November 9.



Following that, I will have consultations to complete, personal business to arrange, and perhaps a long weekend
with Carol before we go. As I look at it all, it is possible we will not get to Vienna before December. That isn't
an issue; the post will manage the business piece, and we will have time to settle affairs here and find our new

home there before the new year.



And I share a moment of sadness. These years have meant a lot to me.



Joe

This will work. Sadly.

Best.

Cheryl:



Are we in a good place to begin paperwork to bring Jen Davis up here on TDY in October?



If so, I would recommend we ask her to report on October 29 and I will get the EX office to start the

paperwork. She will be detailed to us for 90 days, which will enable her to receive funding for housing, meals +

incidentals, etc., and this 90 day period will carry her through the end of the term on January 20, 2013. This

schedule would give me 10 days or so of consultation before a desired departure for Vienna on November 14.



If we are not quite there yetâ€” and I know we have been deeply committed to addressing urgencies over the past

weeks and may not have gotten HRC sign-off-- then we should sit down with a calendar and figure this out.


I am not intent on rushing out to Vienna; the closer we get the more there is to be done, and we may not get

ourselves "packed out" before we depart (not a wholly unwelcomed outcome, since we can set aside that task for

December or January). But, if the elements are in place, Carol and I would like to go out mid-November in order

to participate in IAEA meetings on November 26-30.



My swearing-in ceremony is scheduled for November 9 at 10am on the 8 th floor. Whatever plan we embrace, that

date is set and Carol and I are eager for the day.



Joe
