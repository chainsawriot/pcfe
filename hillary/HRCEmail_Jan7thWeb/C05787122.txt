One lesson learned: when it comes to Al-Jazeera news coverage, it helps having Qatar involved. Anything to report? I
could call now if you're available.

Latest News on Libya from

Al-Jazeera

Al-Jazeera and Al-Jazeera English carry live the 4:10 pm (Washington time) Pentagon briefing by Navy Vice Admiral
William E. Gortney, director of the Joint Staff, on progress in the Operation Odyssey Dawn. Later, Al-Jazeera continues
to run the following quotes from his briefing on the bottom of its screen:

- Operations against Qaddafi's forces to the South of Benghazi were successful

- We doubt all Qaddafi's pronouncements including those declaring ceasefire

- There are no indications that civilians have fallen in Libya as a result of Operation Odyssey Dawn

Al-Jazeera highlights announcement by Libyan military that a complete ceasefire will be implemented as of 9:00 pm
(Tripoli time) on Sunday 20 March in response to request by members of the African Union. Immediately following, Al-
Jazeera interviews an opposition leader, Abd-al-Hafiz Fuqa, in Benghazi who stresses that Qaddafi and his forces have no
intention of stopping their attacks but just want to deceive the international community. Fuqa expresses the delight of
the rebels by Operation Odyssey Dawn because it has completely changed the equation in their favor as their forces
stand now face to face with Qaddafi's forces. Fuqa denies reports that Misrata has been taken over by Qaddafi's forces
saying that only one street and one square from Misrata are under Qaddafi's control. Al-Jazeera also contacts a rebel
from Misrata who confirms the news.

Other breaking news from

Al-Jazeera on the situation includes:

- Rebel forces are moving towards Ajdabia to help break its siege

- Smoke is seen bellowing from Al-Azizya, Qaddafi's headquarters

- Shelling continues in Tripoli




Qatari News Agency announces that Qatari planes are helping in enforcing the no-fly zone over Libya




Reuters reports that an unnamed US official responded to Arab League criticism of the West's action by stating that
operations are in response to the UNSC resolution that all measures will be taken to protect Libyan civilians.

- British Foreign Minister Hague stresses that there is no comparison between this operation and the attack on Iraq.




Highlights from other Arab papers




All papers headline the beginning of the operation, most depending on wire services with UAE

Khaleej Times headlining: "Initial bombing called successful; endgame unclear." Qatar's

Al-Raya reports that Qatar's Foreign Minister Hamad Bin Jasem participated in the Paris summit and Sarkozy announces
launch of operations.




Pan-Arab

Al-Quds al-Arabi reports that influential Egyptian cleric Qardawi (resides in Qatar), said in an interview with

Al-Jazeera that the "battles against Qaddafi are not a 'Crusade' and were requested by Arab countries."

In an editorial entitled: "Attacks Cannot be Excuse for Invasion," UAE


Gulf News argues that "building the future of Libya should be left to the people alone," stressing the importance that the
"goal of military action in Libya be clearly defined," and the "goal not be altered" over time.




In an op-ed in Lebanon's

Daily Star, Rami Khouri is encouraged as the "chimes of freedom ring in Benghazi." He opines that the UNSC resolution
is "complex and full of imprecision" but is necessary in face of Qaddafi's tyranny.
