Subject:                          Project Update



MS:

Monica and I organized everything in the third floor office today into the existing folder system by month.

The one thing we did not do is compose (and in some cases update) the indexes for each folder, principally because we
want to be able to cross-check your notes with the official schedules to make sure we are filing everything correctly. As
of this afternoon, I am now able to access the schedules remotely.

If you approve, I can prepare and update the indexes next week while you are on travel.

-Rob
