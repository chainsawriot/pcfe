Subject: General Honore phone call - FYI ONLY

Secretary Clinton,




I just had a good conversation with General Honore. Call notes below are FYI only, but I hope they are helpful.




His advice:

      Specify technical problems and communicate widely so the private sector can bring the best technology to bear
against problems (eg building the port, logistics, etc.)

      The Comfort will fill quickly so will need a plan B for overflow. Medical needs will go on for months and it is not
possible to build local capacity to meet needs.

       Focus security efforts on security for the distribution network

       I shared our thinking on jobs programs and he felt this was critical

      Felt Pres Preval needed to be more visible as the leader. We should get him a helicopter so he can be seen as
surveying his country.

       Create a rule that 60-70 percent of reconstruction is done by Haitians

       Task DOD to build the toilets / keep pushing military and be specific




Very good conversation and I found it helpful. I also described our approach and felt he was quite supportive.




Thanks,
Raj
