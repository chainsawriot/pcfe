Subject:                           RE: How did yesterday go? And how does G'town look?



GU â€” all is in readiness. We expect to have strong military representation in the audience. I'm still finalizing Flournoy and
Admiral and General on Joint Chiefs. We've had tentative confirmation. Many others from USG are coming, including
Carnahan and Gwen Moore so far from Congress, Samantha from WH....
Finally POTUS just signed EO and NAP! This has been an ordeal beyond description but we will get you over the finish
line and it will be a huge achievement.

Re: yesterday. Many, many favorable comments and incredible enthusiasm. The panelists and speakers were superb and
the President of Kosovo was a real star. I think what we have to do next is grow the commitments and make it more
inclusive -- beyond the 7 Sisters base and what you announced yesterday. This has enormous potential and it is the area
in which women have made the least progress: political elective office. Bottom line: incredible positive feedback and
potential.
