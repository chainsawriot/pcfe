Not good news if it was indeed Kurdish militants.


(SBU) The ferry was carrying 17 passengers and four crew in the Gulf of Izmit, northwest Turkey, according to
press. Reports suggest Kurdish militants overpowered the crew. Several coast guard vessels and a helicopter are
tracking the ferry. Consulate General Istanbul comments this ferry route is not commonly used by U.S. citizens, but is
working to confirm if any were affected
