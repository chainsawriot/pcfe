House GOP wants Clinton to testify on Keystone
By Andrew Restuccia - 01/18/12 03:59 PM ET



    House Republicans have invited Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to testify next week on the Obama
    administration's decision to reject the Keystone XL, pipeline.

    Clinton's testimony would further elevate the Keystone issue, which has been the topic of an already high-
    profile fight between the Obama administration and Republicans in Congress.

    House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.) said Wednesday that he invited
    Clinton to testify in front of his panel Wednesday.

    "We've asked her and the request has gone forward," Upton told reporters, adding that the committee has not
    yet received a response.

    The request came on the same day that President Obama, acting on the advice of the State Department,
    rejected the pipeline, which would carry oil sands crude from Alberta, Canada, to refineries along the Gulf
    Coast.

    The State Department has headed up a multi-year review of the project.

    A State Department spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
