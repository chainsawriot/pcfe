Subject: RE: Jeff s phone number?

Ambassador -- Yes, I agree. I just came back from spending about an hour with Jeff, who is now here at BAF.




                                                                     , but as things now stand, he will not go to
Germany until sometime tomorrow, so there will be a chance for you to go and see him at the hospital after the ramp
ceremony. (COMISAF and COMIJC are also planning to attend the ceremony and then go to the hospital.) We have it all
worked out. Will confirm that this is still the case in the morning.

I am now going to call Jeff's wife, but I after that, I am reachable at ext 2270 or 2276.

I don't want to be cynical, but, I think, we have a muslim victim here, who died for others of his faith -- isn't there a
message here?
