To President Obama:
     The Elders have accepted an invitation from North Korea to visit
Pyongyang during the last week in April. Our itinerary has not been
finalized, but we will probably make brief stops in China and South Korea.
Our basic purposes will be to learn as much as possible about humanitarian
problems, the political and military situation, and to encourage peace and
denuclearization of the Peninsula.
     Included in the trip will be Mary Robinson, Gro Brundtland, and Marti
Ahtissari. It would be helpful if I could receive a briefing to help
assure that our efforts are compatible with American policy.
     Best wishes, Jimmy Carter
