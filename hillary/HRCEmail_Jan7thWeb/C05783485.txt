Just meeting with Indos. Consensus on welcoming chairmanship in 2014 came out of leaders meeting. We are trying to
weigh in on Chairman's language. Very squishy.

Just met with Viets. Gave them clear message on expectations wrt PSI. Promised a decision to me from their leadership
by late this evening. They did promise to speak early on maritime security in EAS -- they played a similar catalyst role in
2010.




                                                                         Longer email to follow.

Will meet with Burma FM on every dimension of roll out and trip to confirm all our previous understandings at 7. All for
now Kurt
