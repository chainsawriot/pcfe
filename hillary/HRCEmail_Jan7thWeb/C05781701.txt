Jake, Huma: can you brief S on this? Iraqis want an additional 24 hours beyond the 8/1 deadline. This may/may give
them time to resolve Min of Defense issue, as jim notes.

Talabani just told me Hashemi and Allawi just raised this and he wants our views before deciding. This strongly suggests
some deal for MOD is in the works--and I have heard similar talk a bit ago from Rowsch. I will see Allawi in an hour and
will try to get more info.

Please advise soonest. Jim
