Team,

               ust signed off on the U.S.-ASEAN Leaders Meeting Joint Statement. Attached is the final version of the
negotiated text — Phils are formatting now for release. Amazingly after this awful process, we ended up with .a good
product that is a light-years improvement from last year on our key strategic interests.             s very happy with
the work that went into this and where we ended up. Colin asked me to pass on a thanks and "great work" message to
everyone involved. Beers on me when we get back.

-Brian
