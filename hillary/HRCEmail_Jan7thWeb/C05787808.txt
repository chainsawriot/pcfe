     CONTEXT

     Having signed the US-Tunisia Political and Economic Partnership last week, the
     enclosed conference proposal will fulfill one of the main objectives of the joint
     declaration announced this week (attachment 1), which reads in part:

            To galvanize the interests of potential investors in the Tunisian market, the
            Governments intend to undertake events that link potential investors to the
            Tunisian diaspora who are, indeed, among the best and most genuine exemplars
            of the benefits of doing business in Tunisia. To that end, the U.S. Overseas
            Private Investment Corporation intends to explore how to catalyze significant new
            American private sector investment in Tunisia, including expansion of small-to-
            medium enterprise lending, as well as opportunities in franchising, infrastructure,
            and renewable resources and clean technology in the country.

     Hosted by Special Representative Balderston, Ambassador Taylor, A/S Fernandez,
     OPIC CEO Littlefield, and other senior USG officials, this conference will bring
     together 300 US investors who are interested in deepening ties with Tunisia. A
     preliminary list will draw from the US Chamber of Commerce, Arab-American
     Chamber of Commerce, Jim Zogby's network through Partners for a New
     Beginning, the Tunisian American Young Professionals network, and the list of
     companies currently doing business in Tunisia (attachment 3). Secretary Clinton
     will conclude the day's session with closing remarks.


•    FORMAT
