Adding my state email too.

Jack - let's discuss in am - I'm unclear if Joe is saying they can build and don't need any govt security assistance b/c of the
training they have done of locals to do this work or something else.

But before I call him, want to know the situation with the contracts.

Please check out what Joe is saying here. He is now working for a company that has a good track record building in Iraq
and wants to do so in Afghanistan. Let me know. Thx.

Dear Madame Secretary,

I am taking the liberty of sending this directly to you rather than through Sid because it is of immediate import and is
outside Sid's area of expertise.




Further to our discussion about working in dangerous areas and pacifying them, we were shocked to learn that USAID
and its coterie of pet Cost Plus Contractors are mothballing projects and refusing to consider others because
of the perceived danger. With that as an attitude, we will not succeed
in
Afghanistan. This flies in the face of recent policy decisions, and
should
be seen as such. If AID won't do the job, money should be transferred to the military. They are better at understanding
the real risk, contracting and spending the money. And the Cost plus contractors should just get out and let companies
like Symbion, who have a proven track record get in there and roll up our sleeves.




I have attached and copied below a memo to me from Paul Hinks, the President of our company which lays out our
thinking.




Valerie joins me in extending our best wishes to you and the family this holiday season. All the best for the new year.
Joe

From. Paul Hinks

Date. 18th December 2009




Electricity Infrastructure in Southern Afghanistan




President Obama has announced a US troop increase in Afghanistan and it seems like most of the deployment is in the
hostile areas in the south and in the east. He has also stated that there will be a considerable civil component that will
accompany the troop surge.




In contradiction , USAID has now stated publicly that they have mothballed the installation of the new turbine at Kajaki
hydro-electric plant and they will not be able to build the new 110kV transmission line from Kajaki to Sangin, Tangi, Duri
Junction, Lashkar Gah and then Kandahar. USAID funds have been available for this project since 2006 but nothing has
been done.
They say that the funds will be reallocated to less hostile places where it is easier to work.




The stated reason for mothballing all this work is that it cannot be executed due to poor security conditions in the region
That is exactly what we were told in 2005 in Iraq. That the 400KV transmission line stretching 300kms from Baiji to
Haditha and then onwards to Al Qaim in Al Anbar Province could not be built. Similar sentiments existed about the two
132KV gas insulated substations inside Sadr City in Baghdad which was another 'no go' area controlled by Shiite militias.




The large US 'Cost Plus' contractors who were awarded those construction projects in 2004 told the government that
they could not complete them due to security. The government then terminated the contracts and re-bid them on a
Firm Fixed Price Lump Sum basis. Both of these projects were awarded to Symbion. We employed extraordinary
methods, working with Sheiks and other local leaders and we trained people from those places to do the work.
The
result was that we successfully completed these projects and a further 7 projects most of which were in insecure
locations.




I feel very strongly about the fact that we are withdrawing funding from an area where we need to win over the hearts
and minds of the indigenous population. I simply do not agree that this work cannot be done. We have studied the area
