I met with Amb Kislyak this morning and went over Paul Dean's points with him. Also told him the ratification process is
now entering a new stage and there would be further work on the floor; new amendments being offered, some of which
might be unpleasant and would have to be beaten back. I also said we would work to get the understandings out of the
Instrument of Ratification, but I did not hold out any hope that it would actually happen.

Kislyak remains where he was the other day when I spoke with him, i.e. that it would be better to have a clean IOR
because otherwise we might be into dueling lORs and would not be able to exchange them. I continued to emphasize
that the understandings do not change the rights or obligations of the Treaty nor impose any new obligations on the
Russians. He granted that he is not a lawyer and Russian lawyers would need to look at the ROR, but he was concerned
about the tone—Cold War issues were being rehashed, he complained, like cheating and compliance. He didn't think it
would play well at all in Moscow, and warned me of Russian Cold Warriors. I stressed it was important to take a
measured tone in both capitals—he agreed with that—and also stressed that Chairman had beaten back all "killer
amendments" in the mark-up process yesterday. Again, nothing affecting the rights or obligations of the Treaty is in the
ROR, nor any new obligations imposed on the RF.

Bottom line: we agreed to stay in close touch. I told him I'd send him the clean final ROR as soon as I have it; also
offered to put our lawyers in touch with their lawyers if it would prove helpful in reading through the ROR. He took that
on board.

                                                                 Will follow up further over the weekend and on
Monday. RG
