On Syria, NEA says the UN's 5,400 figure is the closest we have to an official count, but its a few weeks old so almost
certainly low. The LCCs claim the number is more like 7,000 dead, but that's shakier. I would add to the intervention
like this:




Happy to make other changes this morning as needed.

Really hard to get a good number on Libya. UN Human Rights Council put the number as of June at 10k-15k, but it got
complicated as time went by because of claims about NATO-caused casualties. NTC number is 20K-30K total by the end.

 NYTimes story this morning states that UN asserts 5400 civilian deaths in Syria thus far. First, is that accepted as
accurate?
