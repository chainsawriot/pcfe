Dear Jonathan,

When I was at the President's and the Secretary's house this spring we talked about the creation of a World Food Stewardship
Council.

Kelly Brownell, from Yale, is leading this effort and we would love the opportunity to meet with the President (and Secretary if
possible) in New York. Attached is a draft of a vision for this council. We are flexible with our dates.

Not sure how to best get this scheduled but know you can help.

Prince Charles gave a compelling speech at Georgetown last year on this issue (see link
below). http://www.onthefutureoffood.org/

And the time is right for a coordinated effort at the highest levels to address the global issues of hunger, obesity and
sustainability as one great problem.

Thanks for your help.

In service,

Mark
