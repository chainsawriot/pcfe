Dear Prime Minister Pierre-Louis:

Thank you for your gracious hospitality and your generosity with your time. You give us all confidence that while the road
ahead is long, there is a path that we can travel together to begin to see the progress you and we seek for Haiti.

I shared our visit with the Secretary who reiterated how critical it is to have your support and to provide you with the
support and assistance you need to deliver on the Haiti's goals.

I am meeting next week with our team -- including our new Ambassador designate Ken Merton who will be intimately
involved in ensuring our plans are on track and implemented effectively -- and with President Clinton to lay out our
thoughts on how best to get started and would welcome the chance to connect with you afterwards.

I anticipate traveling to Haiti the week after next; if convenient for you, we would like to meet then to update you on our
progress and get your guidance.

I am looking forward to the future and to having the chance to work with you closely.

Best regards,

Cdm
