Subject: Mukherjee call sheet

This might be too late but Bernadette just called to say that you were looking for the call sheet. I've typed out the
unclass portions of the sheet.

Purpose of call - you agreed during your January 25 mtg w Indian Ambassador Nirumpama Rao to call Mukherjee while
he is in Chicago. Muherjee last visited the US in Sept 2011 for the CEO Forum, and you last met him in July during the
Strategic Dialogue.

                                                                                                                        1.4(B)
                                                                                                                        1.4(D)
                                                                                                                        B1


                                                                                                                               B5




Background:
