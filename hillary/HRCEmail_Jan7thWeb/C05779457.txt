Janet, Sergio,

Am covering for David over the weekend.

Our Foreign Minister and Sec. Clinton have tried to get in touch today to discuss Libya/NFZ and next steps in NY, but it
was finally decided that they would talk on Monday, after our Minister returns from Egypt where he is until tomorrow.

Here is where Paris stands as of today and the message we wanted to convey to you:
                                                                                                                           1.4(B)
                                                                                                                           1.4(D)
                                                                                                                           B1
