                            New film 'grossly inaccurate and misleading'

              Urges Sony Pictures to clarij) that torture played no role in hunt
                                       for bin Laden
                     Washington—Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein (D-
            Calif.), Senate Armed Service Committee Chairman Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and Senate
            Armed Service Committee Ranking Member John McCain (R-Ariz.) today sent a letter to
            Sony Pictures Entertainment, the studio distributing the upcoming film "Zero Dark
            Thirty," the fictional account of the CIA's 11-year hunt for Usama bin Laden.

                    The senators described the movie as "grossly inaccurate and misleading,"
            particularly graphic scenes of CIA officers torturing detainees that "credits these
            detainees with providing critical lead information" on the courier who led to the bin
            Laden compound.

                    The senators wrote: "Zero Dark Thirty is factually inaccurate, and we believe that
             you have an obligation to state that the role of torture in the hunt for Usama Bin Laden is
             not based on the facts, but rather part of the film's fictional narrative."

                     Full text of the letter follows:

     Chairman and CEO
     Sony Pictures Entertainment
   • 10202 W. Washington Blvd.
     Culver City, CA 90232-3195

     Dear Mr. Lynton:

             We write to express our deep disappointment with the movie Zero Dark Thirty.
     We believe the film is grossly inaccurate and misleading in its suggestion that torture
     resulted in information that led to the location of Usama bin Laden.

              We understand that the film is fiction, but it opens with the words "based on first-
     hand accounts of actual events" and there has been significant media coverage of the
     CIA's cooperation with the screenwriters. As you know, the film graphically depicts CIA
     officers repeatedly torturing detainees and then credits these detainees with providing
     critical lead information on the courier that led to the Usama Bin Laden. Regardless of
     what message the filmmakers intended to convey, the movie clearly implies that the
     CIA's coercive interrogation techniques were effective in eliciting important information
     related to a courier for Usama Bin Laden. We have reviewed CIA records and know that
     this is incorrect.

              Zero Dark Thirty is factually inaccurate, and we believe that you have an
      obligation to state that the role of torture in the hunt for Usama Bin Laden is not based on
      the facts, but rather part of the film's fictional narrative.

             Pursuant to the Senate Intelligence Committee's recently-adopted Study of the
      CIA's Detention and Interrogation program, Committee staff reviewed more than 6
      million pages of records from the Intelligence Community. Based on that review,
      Senators Feinstein and Levin released the following information on April 30, 2012,
      regarding the Usama Bin Laden operation:

       The CIA did not first learn about the existence of the Usama Bin Laden courier from
      CIA detainees subjected to coercive interrogation techniques. Nor did the CIA discover
      the courier's identity from detainees subjected to coercive techniques. No detainee
      reported on the courier's full name or specific whereabouts, and no detainee identified the
      compound in which Usama Bin Laden was hidden. Instead, the CIA learned of the
      existence of the courier, his true name and location through means unrelated to the CIA
      detention and interrogation program.

      Information to support this operation was obtained from a wide variety of intelligence
      sources and methods. CIA officers and their colleagues throughout the Intelligence
      Community sifted through massive amounts of information, identified possible leads,
      tracked them down, and made considered judgments based on all of the available
      intelligence.

      The CIA detainee who provided the most significant information about the courier
      provided the information prior to being subjected to coercive interrogation techniques.

             In addition to the information above, former CIA Director Leon Panetta wrote
      Senator McCain in May 2011, stating:

              "...no detainee in CIA custody revealed the facilitator/courier's full
              true name or specific whereabouts. This information was discovered
              through other intelligence means."

             We are fans of many of your movies, and we understand the special role that
     movies play in our lives, but the fundamental problem is that people who see Zero Dark
     Thirty will believe that the events it portrays are facts. The film therefore has the potential
     to shape American public opinion in a disturbing and misleading manner. Recent public
     opinion polls suggest that a narrow majority of Americans believe that torture can be
     justified as an effective form of intelligence gathering. This is false. We know that cruel,
     inhuman, and degrading treatment of prisoners is an unreliable and highly ineffective
     means of gathering intelligence.

             The use of torture should be banished from serious public discourse for these
     reasons alone, but more importantly, because it is a violation of the Geneva Conventions,
     because it is an affront to America's national honor, and because it is wrong. The use of
     torture in the fight against terrorism did severe damage to America's values and standing
     that cannot be justified or expunged. It remains a stain on our national conscience. We
     cannot afford to go back to these dark times, and with the release of Zero Dark Thirty, the
     filmmakers and your production studio are perpetuating the myth that torture is effective.
     You have a social and moral obligation to get the facts right.

             Please consider correcting the impression that the CIA's use of coercive
     interrogation techniques led to the operation against Usama Bin Laden. It did not.

             Thank you for your assistance on this important matter.

     Sincerely,

      Dianne Feinstein
