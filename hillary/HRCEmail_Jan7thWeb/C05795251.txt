       Commentary/Analysis:
       The end of Bullshit Mountain (Boaz Gaon, Maariv) The phrase 'bullshit mountain' was termed by
       Jon Stewart of the Daily Show in order to describe the mountain of lies where in recent years the
       most vocal of the American right-wing leaders live. Those that believe that Barack Obama is a
       Muslim or that weapons of mass destruction are still buried in Iraq. Yesterday, around 1PM on Shaul
       Hamelech Street in Tel-Aviv, the Israeli 'Bullshit Mountain' collapsed once and for all. The residents
       of the local mountain were busy building it in recent years, shovel after shovel. They explained that
       making war is the surest to achieve security. And making peace, or ceasefire, is a certain recipe for
       war. According to the residents of the Israeli 'Bullshit Mountain,' where most Israeli right-wing leaders
       and the commentators on their behalf moved in recent years, Israel does not need regional allies.
       Turkey can be put to sit on the mat [refers to humiliating incident where Deputy Foreign Minister
       Danny Ayalon called in Turkish Ambassador and had him sit on a very low seat with a camera
       filming to display later how he humiliated the ambassador - OH], we can put our feet up on Egypt's
       lap, we can send Jordan to drink from the sea of Gaza - and Gaza we can use as a training field
       once every four years. Israel, of course, is not really from the Middle East. It's actually a conservative
       country bordering Florida, or a great Eastern European power that gets its feet wet in the Baltic Sea,
       and therefore all that is needed to assure the good of Israel is to make it hated regionally. Let
       Erdogan hate us. Let the Egyptian people despise us. To hell with it, let the President of the United
       States hate us. And the more he hates us - that secret Muslim - the better the situation of the
       residents of the south. Assassinations are helpful at any time and under any conditions. Racism is a
       virtue. "I am proud to be a racist," Likud MK Miri Regev told (Arab) MK Jamal Zahalka this week.)
       Dialogue is a synonym for treason, unless of course, it's the residents of Bullshit Mountain who
       declared it essential, for example with someone like Ahmed Jabari, in order to bring back a captive
       soldier or to curb the shooting at the south of the country. The Palestinian demand for a state, a
       demand that was adopted by the present (Israeli) prime minister, is diplomatic terror, for which we
       must focus on advancing the option of "one state" in which the (Palestinian) residents of the West
       Bank will become residents without a right to vote and Gaza residents will become Egyptian citizens.
       So what if the Palestinians call this plan a hallucination. It's true that the whole world agrees (with
       them) and also half the Israeli public. But it doesn't matter what the world, the Palestinians, the
       people of the region and half of the Israelis think. It's important what Naftali Bennet [Chairman of
       extreme right Habayit Hayehudi party -OH] says in his illustrated plan called "the plan for calm" for
      annexing the West Bank, which is like a virtual visitors' hall for those who enter "Bullshit Mountain."

       This mountain began to crumble, when the Israeli south got lost inside a cloud of smoke and sorrow.
       It began to split when the first missiles were shot at Tel-Aviv and Jerusalem. It collapsed yesterday
       afternoon, when bus #142 exploded in Tel-Aviv. Now it's time to attack the Israeli Bullshit Mountain
       from the air and return to live in reality. For the sake of the State of Israel and the region.

                               they received, not made. Some
                               Israelis complained they did not
                               want a ceasefire while Gazans
                               celebrated in the streets. And in a

                               Haaretz's Barak Ravid writes that
                               the agreement is almost identical to
                               the one reached in Operation Cast
                               Lead, giving Israel security
                               assurances and allowing Gazans
                               more freedom of movement. Within
                               24 hours of the ceasefire, Israel will
                               open Gaza crossings, allowing freer
                               movement of goods and people.
                               Israel also agreed to end
                               'assassinations.'


                               Israeli reservists remain on
                               standby, but are expected to
                               gradually be released home.
                               Haaretz writes: While the IDF
                               expects rocket attacks to continue
                               even after the cease-fire, the army
                               intends to respond in a way that will
                               neither lead to additional escalation
                               nor violate the cease-fire
                               agreement. The IDF will respond to
                               rocket attacks only if they represent
                               a real threat or danger, said senior
                               officers. It is possible the IDF will
                               not respond to solitary rockets fired
                               at Israel over the next few days,
                               based on the assumption that
                               enforcing the cease-fire on all the
                               various Palestinian organizations in
                               Gaza will take time.

                               The US put great pressure on
                               Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
                               Netanyahu to agree to a ceasefire.
                               Yedioth's Itamar Eichner writes that
                               US President Barack Obama and
                               Secretary of State Hilary Clinton
                               told Israel that a military move could
                               cause a regional military escalation.
                               The Americans were concerned
                               Morsi wouldn't be able to stand up
                               to the pressure from the street and
                               they thought Syria's Bashar al-
                               Assad would take advantage of the
                               situation to make a military move
                               against Israel in order to save his
                               own regime.
                               The violence increased just ahead
                               of the ceasefire. Israel killed two
                               people in airstrikes just at the
                               Egyptians announced the deal, one
                               was 14-year-old Nadir Abu
                               Mugheiseeb, Maan reports. The
                               Israeli papers did not report on
                               this.


                               Netanyahu said the ceasefire with
                               Hamas was the right thing for
                               Israel. While Hamas' Khaled
                               Mashaal said Israel capitulated to
                               Hamas' demands. (VIDEO) Indeed,
                               southern residents of Israel claimed
                               Netanyahu capitulated to terror.
                               They wanted a ground offensive,
                               not a ceasefire.But jubilant
                               Palestinians spilled into the streets
                               of Gaza in celebration.

                               of Tel-Aviv. No one was killed, most
                               of the 22 people were only lightly
                               injured. Boaz Gaon, a young Israeli
                               playwright and journalist, wrote a
                               very funny and cynical Op-Ed in
                               Maariv about 'Bullshit Mountain.'
                               (See below)


                               Channel 10's Amnon Levy
                               interviewed former defense minister
                               Binyamin Fouad Ben Eliezer (Labor
                               party) who said that Yitzhak Rabin
                               and Ariel Sharon, both former prime
                               ministers and defense ministers,
                               were murderers just as much as
                               assassinated Hamas military chief
                               Ahmed Jabari, who "was a man of
                               his word.' He also said that
                               according to IDF procedure it is
                               forbidden to kill more than one
                               innocent person in an assassination
                               and if one innocent person will die,
                               it can only be to kill a 'ticking bomb.'
                               The interview is part of the program
                               which investigates the steps taken
                               preceding the assassination of
                               Jabari, Ben-Eliezer was asked by
                               Levy what he thought about Jabari,
                               as someone who was defense
                               minister in 2002-2001, during the
                               Sharon government. From what he
                               said it can be understood that
                               Jabari's assassination was a
                               mistake, because only with
                               "murderers" of his kind, can we

                               and observed.
                               "I know him, I know him," said Ben
                               Eliezer to Levy, "He is a real
                               man, a real man."
                               Levy: "It was alleged that he was
                               among the moderates. Aluf Benn
                               wrote that in Haaretz."
                               Ben Eliezer: "If you ask me, his
                               word was his word. When he said,
                               'I'll give you, then he gave you.
                               You've probably heard me say
                               more than once: 'Release
                               Barghouti.' Why?"
                               Levy: "So that we can do business
                               with him?"
                               Ben-Eliezer: "Because you only do
                               business with murderers. Learn
                               this. Only with murderers. Hafez al-
                               Assad was a murderer. Sadat was
                               a murderer. Rabin was a murderer.
                               kik (Sharon) was a murderer.
                               Hussein was a murderer. True or
                               not true?" (Last night Ben Eliezer
                               told Yedioth Ahronoth, "that he
                               meant to say that Rabin and
                               Sharon were strong people).
                               Ben Eliezer asked to clarify what he
                               said about Rabin and Sharon is
                               meant that they were "killers," slang

                               Mandelblit, reveals that the IDF has
                               a procedure that defines the
                               exact number of casualties that
                               are not involved or are innocent
                               (so-called "collateral damage")
                               that it is permitted to kill in a
                               targeted assassination.
                               According to the former JAG that
                               the number is: one.
                               Mandelblit tells Levy that the
                               procedure states that first, the
                               target must be "marked for death,"
                               but not for crimes of the past, only
                               for crimes or attacks he plans to do
                               in the future. It cannot be targeted
                               killing as punishment or revenge.
                               The second condition, according
                               Mandelblit is regarding collateral
                               damage - that is, the number of
                               innocent people who are allowed to
                               be killed along with the target of
                               assassins: It must be as small a
                               number as possible.
                               Levy asks what number. "I prefer
                               not to answer that," replied
                               Mandelblit, "but these numbers are
                               very low. Very, very low. Close to
                               zero." (Haaretz Hebrew)

                               Street in Tel-Aviv, the Israeli
                               'Bullshit Mountain' collapsed once
                               and for all. The residents of the
                               local mountain were busy building it
                               in recent years, shovel after shovel.
                               They explained that making war is
                               the surest to achieve security. And
                               making peace, or ceasefire, is a
                               certain recipe for war. According to
                               the residents of the Israeli 'Bullshit

                               wing leaders and the commentators

                               Turkish Ambassador and had him

                               every four years. Israel, of course,
                               is not really from the Middle East.
                               It's actually a conservative country
                               bordering Florida, or a great

                               it hated regionally. Let Erdogan
                               hate us. Let the Egyptian people
                               despise us. To hell with it, let the

                               treason, unless of course, it's the
                               residents of Bullshit Mountain who
                               declared it essential, for example
                               with someone like Ahmed Jabari, in
                               order to bring back a captive soldier
                               or to curb the shooting at the south
                               of the country. The Palestinian
                               demand for a state, a demand that
                               was adopted by the present (Israeli)
                               prime minister, is diplomatic terror,
                               for which we must focus on
                               advancing the option of "one state"
                               in which the (Palestinian) residents
                               of the West Bank will become
                               residents without a right to vote and
                               Gaza residents will become
                               Egyptian citizens. So what if the
                               Palestinians call this plan a
                                hallucination. It's true that the whole
                                world agrees (with them) and also
                                half the Israeli public. But it doesn't
                                matter what the world, the
                                Palestinians, the people of the
                                region and half of the Israelis think.
                                It's important what Naftali Bennet

                               when the Israeli south got lost
