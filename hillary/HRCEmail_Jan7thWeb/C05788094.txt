Subject: Re: New Executive Order on Global Development Council - Under Embargo until Thursday

Jake and Cheryl,

For your situational awareness — Cindy and I went to an NSS meeting today where it was announced that the President
has just signed an Executive Order establishing a Global Development Council, which will be a group of up to 12 experts
drawn from academia, non-profits/foundations, civil society and private industry, plus the Secretaries of State, Defense,
Treasury, USAID Admin and MCC CEO as non-voting members. The plan to establish a Council was announced in the
PPD.

The Council's mission is to advise the President, through the NSS/NEC, on global development policy, including public-
private partnerships, innovative and scalable approaches to development, best practices for R&D, and long-term
solutions to strategic development issues. USAID is to provide funding and administrative support for the Council. USAID
will appoint an Executive Director who serve as a liaison to the Administrator and the EOP, and consult with relevant
executive departments, agencies and offices on matters and activities pertaining to the Council. •




                                        It's under embargo until the fact sheet is issued on Thursday. Naz may have
further details/history.



Kind regards,
Al and Cindy
